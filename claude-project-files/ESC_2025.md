1. Preamble
Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of as­
sisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic 
approach for an individual patient with a given condition. The European 
Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines are intended for use by health 
professionals but do not override their individual responsibility to make 
appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s 
health condition and in consultation with the patient or the patient’s care­
giver where appropriate and/or necessary aiming at shared care decisions. 
It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and reg­
ulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of pre­
scription and to respect the ethical rules of their profession.
The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on 
a given topic. Guideline topics are selected for updating after 
annual expert review of new evidence conducted by the ESC Clinical 
Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee. ESC Policies and Procedures 
for formulating and issuing the ESC Guidelines can be found on the 
ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice- 
Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines).
Interim Focused Updates are created when the publication of new 
evidence could influence clinical practice before the next full update 
of a Guideline is published. This Focused Update provides new and re­
vised recommendations for the 2019 ESC/European Atherosclerosis 
Society (EAS) Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias. View 
the full 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines here: https://doi.org/10.1093/ 
eurheartj/ehz455. This Task Force was selected by the ESC and EAS 
to include professionals involved with the medical care of patients 
with this pathology as well as methodologists.
Guidelines Task Forces perform a critical review and evaluation of 
the published literature on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches 
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                                 3

including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Recommendations are 
based on major randomized trials and relevant systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses, when available. Systematic literature searches 
are conducted in cases of controversy or uncertainty to ensure that 
all key studies were considered. For recommendations related to 
diagnosis and prognosis, additional types of evidence are included, 
such as diagnostic accuracy studies and studies focused on the devel­
opment and validation of prognostic models. The strength of each 
recommendation and the level of evidence supporting it are weighed 
and scored according to predefined criteria as outlined in Tables 1
and 2. Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and Patient- 
Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) are also evaluated when avail­
able as the basis for recommendations and/or discussion in these 
Guidelines.
Evidence tables summarizing key information from relevant studies 
are generated to facilitate the formulation of recommendations, to

enhance comprehension of recommendations after publication, and to 
reinforce transparency in the Guidelines development process. The ta­
bles are published in their own section of the Focused Update and ref­
erence specific recommendation tables.
After an iterative process of deliberations, a first Task Force vote on all 
recommendations is conducted prior to the initiation of rounds of re­
view. A second Task Force vote on all recommendations is conducted 
after the final round of review and revision. For each vote, the Task 
Force follows ESC voting procedures and all recommendations require 
at least 75% agreement among voting members to be approved. 
Voting restrictions may be applied based on declarations of interests.
The writing and reviewing panels provide declaration of interest forms 
for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of 
conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest are reviewed according 
to the ESC declaration of interest rules which can be found on the ESC 
website (http://www.escardio.org/doi) and are compiled in a report pub­
lished in a supplementary document with the Guidelines. Funding for the 
development of this ESC/EAS Focused Update was derived entirely from 
the ESC and EAS with no involvement of the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG Committee supervises and co-ordinates the prepar­
ation of new Guidelines and Focused Updates and approves their publi­
cation. In addition to review by the ESC CPG Committee, this ESC/EAS 
Focused Update underwent multiple rounds of peer review on a dedi­
cated online review platform. The review was conducted by topic ex­
perts, including members from ESC National Cardiac Societies and 
from relevant ESC Subspecialty Communities. The Focused Update 
Task Force considered all review comments and was required to re­
spond to all those classified as major. After appropriate revisions, the 
Task Force and the ESC CPG Committee members and the EAS 
Executive Committee approved the final document for publication in 
the European Heart Journal and in Atherosclerosis.
Unless otherwise stated, the Focused Update content refers to sex, 
understood as the biological condition of being male or female, defined 
by genes, hormones and sexual organs. Off-label use of medication may 
be presented in this Focused Update if a sufficient level of evidence 
shows that it can be considered medically appropriate for a given con­
dition. However, decisions on off-label use must be made by the re­
sponsible health professional giving special consideration to ethical 
rules concerning healthcare, the specific situation of the patient, patient 
consent, and country-specific health regulations.
2. Introduction
Since the publication of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the 
management of dyslipidaemias: lipid modification to reduce cardio­
vascular (CV) risk,1 there have been several randomized controlled 
trials that might change patient management ahead of the next sched­
uled full dyslipidaemia Guidelines. This 2025 Focused Update ad­
dresses changes in recommendations for the treatment of 
dyslipidaemias based on new evidence published up until 31 March 
2025. All major randomized controlled clinical trials and 
meta-analyses published after the publication of the 2019 ESC/EAS 
Guidelines were presented and discussed in detail before a consensus 
was reached about any possible classes of recommendations (see 
Table 1) and levels of evidence (see Table 2) to be assigned; these 
were then voted upon for inclusion by all Task Force members. 
Members with declared conflicts of interests in specific topics were 
asked to abstain from voting on those topics.
The Task Force considered and discussed the following new studies, trials, 
and any meta-analyses: Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) 
and Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2-Older Persons (SCORE2-OP) 
for estimation of 10 year CV risk;2,3 CLEAR Outcomes [Cholesterol 
Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL (adenosine triphosphate-citrate 
lyase)-Inhibiting Regimen];4 ELIPSE HoFH (Evinacumab Lipid Studies in 
Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia);5 APPROACH 
(Reduction of Triglyceride Levels in Familial Chylomicronemia 
Syndrome);6 REPRIEVE (Pitavastatin to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease in 
HIV Infection);7 STRENGTH (Long-Term Outcomes Study to Assess 
Statin Residual Risk with Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients 
with Hypertriglyceridemia);8 STOP-CA (Atorvastatin for Anthracycline- 
Associated Cardiac Dysfunction);9 SPORT (Supplements, Placebo, or 
Rosuvastatin Study);10 and OMEMI (Omega-3 Fatty acids in Elderly with 
Myocardial Infarction).11 Beside these trials, the Task Force also considered 
and discussed: combination therapy with high-dose statin plus ezetimibe and 
intensification of lipid-lowering therapy during the index hospitalization for 
patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), as well as new 
data on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a risk modifier.
Only results that would lead to new or changed Class I/IIa or Class III 
recommendations were selected for inclusion in Recommendation 
Tables. All new recommendations included in this Focused Update are 
additive to the recommendations of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for 
the management of dyslipidaemias, and all changed recommendations 
substitute those of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management 
of dyslipidaemias.
After due deliberation, the Task Force decided to update recom­
mendations for the following sections of the 2019 ESC/EAS 
Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: 
• Recommendations for CV risk estimation, with implementation of 
the new SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP risk prediction algorithms.
• Recommendations 
on 
low-density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol 
(LDL-C)-lowering therapies, including two new agents for LDL-C- 
lowering treatment (bempedoic acid and evinacumab specifically for 
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia)(FH).
• Recommendations for lipid-lowering therapy during index hospital­
ization of ACS.
• Recommendations on Lp(a).
• Recommendations 
for drug 
treatment 
in 
patients 
with 
hypertriglyceridaemia.
• Recommendations for statin therapy in primary CV disease (CVD) 
prevention for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection.
• Recommendations for statin therapy for patients with cancer at high 
or very high chemotherapy-related CV toxicity risk.
• Recommendations for dietary supplements.
3. Estimation of total 
cardiovascular risk and implications 
for dyslipidaemia management
Atherosclerosis is caused by the progressive deposition of LDL-C and 
other apolipoprotein-B (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins within the ar­
tery wall, which triggers a cascade of inflammatory reactions leading 
to the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaque. As more 
atherogenic lipoproteins become accumulated within the arterial wall 
over time, the atherosclerotic plaque gradually enlarges and the risk 
of having an acute atherosclerotic CV event increases. LDL-C is not 
only a risk factor for atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD), but like 
other ApoB-containing lipoproteins is a direct cause of ASCVD;12
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                                 5

therefore, lowering plasma LDL-C levels should be the main focus for 
preventing atherosclerotic CV events.
In clinical practice, the concentration of circulating LDL-C that can 
become trapped within the artery wall is estimated by measuring plas­
ma levels of LDL-C, which represent the total amount of cholesterol 
carried by low-density lipoproteins. The objective of estimating a per­
son’s risk of having an atherosclerotic CV event is to identify individuals 
at elevated risk who may benefit from interventions to lower LDL-C 
and other modifiable causes of ASCVD. The clinical benefit of lowering 
LDL-C depends on the achieved LDL-C reduction; therefore, indivi­
duals with higher CV risk require more intense LDL-C lowering to 
achieve the same absolute level of residual CV risk while on treatment 
as compared with individuals with lower risk. For example, assuming an 
average 20% proportional (relative) reduction in risk per each mmol/L 
lower LDL-C,13 lowering LDL-C by 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) would re­
duce the risk of a person with a 20% absolute risk of having an acute 
atherosclerotic CV event to 16% (i.e. a 20% relative but 4% absolute 
risk reduction), whereas it would reduce the risk of a person with a 
10% absolute risk to 8% (a 20% relative but 2% absolute risk reduction). 
This Focused Update continues to endorse the concept supported in 
the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines1 that a person’s estimated absolute 
risk of having an acute CV event should be used to guide the intensity 
of LDL-C lowering. We also acknowledge that the CV risk reduction 
achievable by a similar magnitude of lowering atherogenic lipid levels ap­
pears to be greater at younger ages.14,15
Numerous randomized trials have demonstrated that lowering 
LDL-C reduces the risk of both fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarc­
tions (MI) and ischaemic strokes13 as well as ischaemic events in 
peripheral arterial territories.16 Therefore, because CVD morbidity 
(non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke) combined with CVD mortality bet­
ter reflects the total burden of ASCVD, and in line with the current 
dorses the use of risk scores such as SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP (in­
stead of the SCORE algorithm) for estimation of the risk of 
experiencing an MI, ischaemic stroke, or fatal atherosclerotic CV event 
over the next 10 years in persons without known CVD aged between 
40 and 89 years (Recommendation Table 1).
While calculation of the SCORE was based on each person’s total 
cholesterol level, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol 
(which is calculated as total cholesterol minus HDL-C) is used as an 
input in the SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP risk algorithms. Moreover, 
while the SCORE algorithm assessed the 10 year risk of fatal CVD 
in persons aged up to 70 years, the SCORE2/SCORE2-OP algorithms 
(accessible at http://www.heartscore.org) can estimate 10 year risk for 
both fatal and non-fatal CV events also for apparently healthy people 
aged ≥70 years (up to 89 years). SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP are cali­
brated to four clusters of countries (low, moderate, high, and very 
high CVD risk) based on national CVD mortality rates;2,3 details and 
risk charts for these country clusters are in the 2021 ESC Guidelines 
on CVD prevention.17
Table 3 presents the updated definitions for very high, high, moder­
ate, and low CVD risk, using the SCORE2/SCORE2-OP instead of the 
SCORE algorithm for apparently healthy persons (primary prevention). 
This table is intended to replace Table 4 of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines.1
As a general concept, it is estimated that the risk of total CVD events is 
2–3 times higher than the risk of fatal CVD events, although this may

vary considerably according to age and sex. In this Focused Update, a 2× 
multiplier was used to convert previous SCORE-based thresholds17 into 
the SCORE2- or SCORE2-OP-based thresholds to define different cat­
egories of total CVD risk. Notably, this Task Force continues to emphasize 
that risk is a continuum and cut-off points that are used in any CVD risk 
model to define different levels of risk are, in part, arbitrary and based on 
the risk levels at which benefit is evident in clinical trials. Therefore, the 
SCORE2- and SCORE2-OP-based thresholds presented in this document 
(Table 3) reflect this concept.
Because existing population-based CVD risk models are relatively 
crude tools for individual risk prediction,18 attention to additional char­
acteristics that are known to increase CV risk is reasonable in order to 
refine risk assessment, as already discussed in the 2021 ESC Prevention 
Guidelines.17 This is particularly relevant for persons around treatment 
decision thresholds (Recommendation Table 1). Clinical conditions and 
selected biomarkers that can be considered as risk modifiers are sum­
marized in Box 1. Their presence may support reclassifying an individual 
to a higher risk category than would be calculated by the SCORE2 
or SCORE2-OP algorithm, and may thereby guide decisions about 
LDL-C goals and lipid-lowering interventions.
This Focused Update endorses the Class IIa recommendation of the 
2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines1 that arterial (carotid and/or femoral) plaque 
burden should be considered as a risk modifier in individuals at low or

moderate risk. Recent studies have provided important new evidence 
regarding the clinical risk associated with subclinical atherosclerosis 
documented on coronary or peripheral arterial imaging in persons 
without clinical ASCVD.19 While there are no randomized trials 
showing that the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) to classify 
CV risk and guide therapeutic management improves CV outcomes, 
nevertheless consideration of CAC improves both discrimination 
and reclassification.20 An elevated CAC score has been associated 
in a graded fashion with a higher risk of adverse CV events in persons 
without clinical ASCVD (primary prevention);21–23 at markedly ele­
vated CAC values (e.g. CAC score >300), the risk was similar or 
even higher than the risk of patients with known clinical ASCVD 
(secondary prevention).24,25 Conversely, a CAC score of zero has 
been associated with a lower risk of ASCVD events and mortality 
in persons at low to moderate estimated CV risk.26 Consideration 
of CAC improves the accuracy of predicted CVD risk by means of 
the SCORE2 algorithm.27 While the presence of significant (typical­
ly, obstructive) plaque on invasive or computed tomography 
(CT)-based coronary angiography was defined as a feature of very 
high CV risk in the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines,1 the presence of 
less advanced coronary atherosclerosis with non-obstructive pla­
ques was more recently shown to be associated with an increased 
risk of subsequent MI.28 Against this background, while coronary im­
aging or CAC measurement are not indicated as broad screening 
tests for the purpose of CV risk estimation, this Focused Update includes 
a new recommendation that the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis 
by imaging or increased CAC score, if measured, should be considered 
as risk modifiers in individuals at moderate risk or individuals around 
treatment decision thresholds (Recommendation Table 1). It should be 
noted, however, that statin therapy may lead to a decrease in lipid-rich 
plaque and an increase in calcification, indicating plaque stabilization;29,30
therefore, CAC score should be interpreted with caution in statin- 
treated patients.
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without ASCVD, 
the 2023 ESC Guidelines for CVD management in patients with dia­
betes recommend the use of the SCORE2-Diabetes algorithm to esti­
mate 10 year CVD risk.31,32
It is important to note that the LDL-C treatment goals (Figure 1) and 
therapeutic guidance (Table 4) for persons in each risk category have 
not changed from the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines.1 The intensity of 
the recommended LDL-C lowering continues to be determined by a 
person’s level of risk. Previous studies indicated potential underestima­
tion of CV risk based on the SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP,18 and under­
treatment with lipid-lowering therapy in primary prevention if statins 
were to be recommended only for persons at very high risk.33
Importantly, however, as outlined in the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines,1
the recommendation to initiate pharmacological LDL-C-lowering ther­
apy in primary prevention is not restricted to persons at very high risk, 
but depends on both the estimated CV risk and the baseline (untreat­
ed) LDL-C levels (Table 4). This concept was previously illustrated in

 recurrent vascular events while taking
 maximally tolerated statin-based therapy
• Patients with polyvascular (e.g. coronary
 and peripheral) arterial disease

Table 5 of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines, and is now described (without 
changes vs the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines) in Recommendation Table 1.
We further emphasize that the SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP risk- 
estimating algorithms were derived from cohorts of participants 
without clinical ASCVD who were not receiving lipid-lowering ther­
apy. As a result, these algorithms should not be used to estimate risk 
among persons with existing ASCVD or among persons currently on 
lipid-lowering therapy, and they should not be used to ‘re-assess’ 
risk using lipid measurements obtained after initiating Guideline- 
recommended lipid-lowering therapy.
Finally, this Task Force emphasizes that atherosclerosis is a chronic 
progressive disease that begins early in life and slowly progresses 
over time, and the cumulative exposure to higher LDL-C levels at 
younger ages is associated with a higher ASCVD risk later in life.34
Conversely, exposure to lower levels of atherogenic lipids at younger 
ages has the potential to reduce the lifetime risk of developing 
CVD35 and mitigate further progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.15
The discrepancy between our understanding of the biology of how ath­
erosclerosis develops and the practical consequences of informing 
treatment decisions based on 10 year risk underscores the need to de­
velop a new generation of risk- and benefit-estimating algorithms. 
These algorithms should: (i) accurately estimate the lifetime risk of hav­
ing an acute CV event for all individuals regardless of age, and (ii) pro­
vide personalized guidance on the optimal timing and intensity of 
LDL-C lowering needed by each person to reduce their remaining life­
time risk of developing an atherosclerotic CV event.
4. New low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol-lowering therapies
Bempedoic acid is an oral small molecule that inhibits cholesterol syn­
thesis by inhibiting the action of ATP-citrate lyase, a cytosolic enzyme 
upstream of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 
pathway.40 Bempedoic acid is a prodrug and the activating enzyme 
(very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1) is not expressed in skeletal 
muscle.41 Treatment with bempedoic acid has muscle-related adverse 
events similar to placebo.40,42 Bempedoic acid (single dose available, 
180 mg/day) reduces LDL-C levels by approximately 23% as mono­
therapy, approximately 18% when given on a background of statin ther­
apy,40,42 and by 38% when given in a fixed-dose combination with 
ezetimibe.43,44 Treatment with bempedoic acid decreased C-reactive 
protein and did not result in increased haemoglobin A1c levels in pa­
tients with normoglycaemia or pre-diabetes.45 Mendelian randomiza­
tion studies have demonstrated that a genetic variant mimicking the 
effect of ATP-citrate lyase inhibition and lowering plasma LDL-C levels 
by the same mechanism of action is associated with similar reductions in 
the risk of CVD as statins and other non-statin lipid-lowering drugs with 
proven benefit per unit decrease in LDL-C levels.46
The CLEAR Outcomes study was a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study that aimed to determine bempedoic acid’s 
potential for CV risk reduction in statin-intolerant patients at high 
risk of developing major adverse CV events (MACE) during a median

of 40.6 month follow-up.4 A total of 13 970 patients were randomized, 
with approximately 70% in secondary prevention and 30% in primary 
prevention. Patients taking a small dose of a statin (daily dose of ator­
vastatin <10 mg or equivalent) were allowed and constituted 23% of 
the trial population. The time-averaged difference in LDL-C between 
the bempedoic acid and placebo arms was 0.57 mmol/L (22 mg/dL). 
Treatment with bempedoic acid reduced the rate of MACE, defined 
as a composite of death from CV causes, MI, stroke, or coronary revas­
cularization, by 13% [hazard ratio (HR), 0.87; 95% confidence interval 
(CI), 0.79–0.96; P = .004). There was no apparent effect on CV death 
(HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88–1.24). Cardiovascular risk reduction with bem­
pedoic acid is similar to that achieved with statins for a given absolute 
magnitude of LDL-C lowering.47 The rate of myalgia was similar in 
the two arms. Treatment with bempedoic acid increased the risk of 
having elevations in hepatic enzymes [>2× upper limit of normal 
(ULN) for either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate amino­
transferase (AST), 4.5% vs 3.0%], renal impairment (11.5% vs 8.6%), hy­
peruricaemia (10.9% vs 5.6%), gout (3.1% vs 2.1%), cholelithiasis (2.2% 
vs 1.2%), increased platelet count (7.2% vs 0.8%), and decreased haem­
atocrit levels (2.3% vs 0.1%). Because bempedoic acid leads to a small 
and reversible increase in uric acid, caution is required in patients 
with a history of gout, even though gout does not constitute an abso­
lute contraindication to bempedoic acid.
New recommendations for the use of bempedoic acid for LDL-C 
lowering [complementing the recommendations for pharmacological 
LDL-C lowering with statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the 
2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines1] are shown in Recommendation Table 2. 
Figure 2 summarizes the average percentage reduction in LDL-C levels 
with different pharmacological therapies, alone or in combination. It 
should be kept in mind that there is considerable inter-individual vari­
ability in the LDL-C-lowering response to any given lipid-lowering 
drug or combination, which necessitates monitoring of the treatment 
effects after initiation or adaptation of any LDL-C-lowering therapy. 
As outlined in the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines,1 LDL-C levels should 
be measured 4 to 6 weeks after initiation or intensification of 
lipid-lowering therapy.
Inclisiran, a small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule that in­
hibits the synthesis of PCSK9, may represent an alternative approach to 
PCSK9 mAbs (alirocumab and evolocumab). Inclisiran has been shown 
in phase III trials to lower LDL-C levels by approximately 50%.48 Two 
CV outcome trials with inclisiran [>16 000 patients with CVD 
(NCT03705234) and 17 000 patients with established ASCVD 
(NCT05030428)] are currently ongoing and expected to report their 
primary outcomes in 2026 and 2027, respectively.
In patients with homozygous FH, in whom statins and PCSK9 inhibi­
tors have little efficacy and may not suffice to adequately lower LDL-C 
levels,49 evinacumab, an mAb against ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3), 
has shown potential benefits with a reduction of LDL-C close to 
50%.5,50,51
Patients who are unable to take statins because of adverse effects re­
present a challenge in clinical practice. In such cases, the addition of a 
non-statin lipid-modifying agent to a maximally tolerated statin is a valu­
able therapeutic option.1 New evidence supporting the reduction in the 
risk of ASCVD events with ezetimibe in the absence of statin therapy 
(although not necessarily due to statin intolerance) in older persons

aged ≥75 years without history of coronary artery disease was pro­
vided in the randomized, open-label EWTOPIA 75 (Ezetimibe 
Lipid-Lowering Trial on Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular 
Disease in 75 or Older).52 As a general concept, this Task Force recom­
mends to add non-statin therapies with proven cardiovascular benefit, 
such as ezetimibe, a PCSK9 mAb, or bempedoic acid, taken alone or in 
combination, to lower LDL-C if the LDL-C goals are not achieved with 
the maximum tolerated dose of a statin; the choice should be based on 
the magnitude of additional LDL-C lowering needed, patient prefer­
ence, treatment availability, and cost.
5. Combination of lipid-lowering 
therapies during index 
hospitalization for acute coronary 
syndromes
A clear association between intensive lipid-lowering therapies and bet­
ter outcomes in patients after ACS was demonstrated two decades 
ago,56,57 supporting ‘the lower the better’ principle for LDL-C reduc­
tion in this clinical setting. Lipid-lowering therapy is one of the pillars 
of the management of these patients, both in the early post-ACS set­
ting58 and in the chronic, stabilized period after an ACS.59 Patients ex­
periencing ACS are at particularly elevated risk of recurrent CV events, 
especially within the first year after hospital discharge.60 Observational 
data show a 10% cumulative incidence of a second MI, a stroke, or CV 
death within the first 100 days after experiencing an MI,61 reaching 33% 
at 5 years.62 Even in an ideal post-ACS scenario, it can take up to 12 
weeks for patients to receive optimal LDL-C-lowering therapy follow­
ing the current stepwise approach that was recommended in the 2019 
ESC/EAS Guidelines.1 This early post-ACS period corresponds to the 
most vulnerable phase after a major coronary event. Observational 
data show that Guideline-directed, intensive lipid-lowering therapy is 
infrequently prescribed, with few dose adjustments performed after 
hospital discharge,63 and that the majority of patients do not achieve 
their goals.17,64,65 The reasons for this are multifactorial and may in­
clude prescription inertia (prescription of lower-intensity statin), sub­
optimal patient adherence related to side effects of lipid-lowering 
therapies or reluctance to being treated with statins,59 and delays or 
losses to follow-up after discharge from index hospitalization.
The IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy 
International Trial) study showed that the addition of ezetimibe to statin 
therapy (simvastatin 40 mg) within <10 days (median 5 days) after an ACS 
event resulted in incremental lowering of LDL-C levels and a modest but 
significant reduction of adverse CV events.66 Small studies have recently 
demonstrated that very intensive LDL-C-lowering treatment initiated in 
the acute phase after ACS is safe, feasible, and effective in getting more 
patients to recommended LDL-C goals.67–69 In addition, recent data 
from the HUYGENS70 (High-Resolution Assessment of Coronary 
Plaques 
in 
a 
Global 
Evolocumab 
Randomized 
Study) 
and 
PACMAN-AMI71
(Effects of the PCSK9 Antibody Alirocumab 
on Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients With Acute Myocardial 
Infarction) trials reported improvements in coronary plaque size and 
composition in response to acute and very intensive LDL-C reduction 
in the vulnerable post-ACS population. A continuous reduction in CV ad­
verse events has been described even when LDL-C reduction exceeded 
current Guideline-recommended treatment goals.72–74 Recent data from 
the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and 
Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated 
According to Recommended Therapies) Registry reported the lowest 
risk of CV events in those patients who achieved early and sustained 
LDL-C lowering to recommended goals after MI. A stepwise approach 
for LDL-C lowering after MI might therefore result in delayed goal attain­
ment as compared with early intensification of treatment.75,76 These data 
support ‘the sooner, the lower, the better’ as a therapeutic strategy for 
LDL-C lowering in patients with ACS.58
As the extent of LDL-C reduction in response to pharmacological in­
terventions is predictable based on baseline LDL-C levels, it is reasonable 
to assume that a significant proportion of ACS patients will not achieve 
their target goal with high-intensity statin treatment alone, prescribed at 
discharge.77 Therefore, and in line with the current 2023 ESC Guidelines 
for the management of patients with ACS,58 this Task Force proposes a 
strategy of early, intensive LDL-C lowering to be considered in all pa­
tients with ACS, with immediate initiation of statin therapy and combin­
ation treatment with one or more classes of non-statin therapy with 
proven CV benefit as needed, depending on each patient’s lipid-lowering 
therapy prior to the ACS event. The choice of drug for combination 
therapy should be based on the magnitude of additional LDL-C lowering 
required. Several drugs and drug combinations with various efficacies and 
onsets of action are available to enable such a ‘strike early and strong’ ap­
proach (Figure 2). Recommendation Table 3 includes two new recommen­
dations for this clinical setting, for patients who present either with or 
without pre-existing lipid-lowering therapy at the time of the ACS event. 
Beyond the treatment in the acute ACS phase, LDL-C should be checked 
4 to 6 weeks after initiation or intensification of lipid-lowering therapy,

and lifelong treatment to lower LDL-C levels to recommended targets is 
strongly recommended.1
Several ongoing clinical trials, such as EVOLVE-MI (EVOLocumab 
Very Early After Myocardial Infarction; NCT05284747) and 
AMUNDSEN-real [Evolocumab or normal strategies to reach LDL 
objectives in acute myocardial infarction upbound to PCI (percutan­
eous coronary intervention); EUDRACT:20210–005738–0], are in­
vestigating the potential benefit of introducing evolocumab at the 
time of the ACS event. The results of these trials are expected in 
2026–2027.
6. Lipoprotein(a)
Epidemiologic and genetic studies strongly support a likely causal and dir­
ect continuous association between high plasma levels of Lp(a) and high­
er risk of ASCVD and aortic valve stenosis (AVS).78 Emerging data are 
suggesting that high Lp(a) may confer a higher risk of ASCVD and AVS 
per particle or cholesterol content than LDL-C.37,79–84 The mechanisms 
by which Lp(a) and LDL lead to these increased risks therefore likely dif­
fer.78 Based on studies from the United Kingdom, Denmark, and the 
United States of America, the highest risks were for MI and AVS, less 
in peripheral artery disease and heart failure, and the lowest risks were 
for ischaemic stroke and CV and all-cause mortality.37,78,79,85–90 Risk 
from high Lp(a) increases slightly at levels of 30 mg/dL (62 nmol/L) to 
50 mg/dL (105 nmol/L) and becomes clinically relevant above 50 mg/dL 
(105 nmol/L), with higher levels associated with a greater increase in 
CV risk. Lp(a) concentration is predominantly determined by genetics 
(>90%), more than any other lipoprotein, and levels vary with ethnicity.83
There is an incremental increase in risk caused by higher Lp(a) levels, and 
if Lp(a) level is not considered, risk might be substantially underestimated 
(Figure 3).78 Lp(a) measurement should be considered at least once in 
every adult’s lifetime,1 either at the first lipid profile or at the next one 
if lipid profiles have previously been performed. Screening is particularly 
relevant in younger patients with FH or premature ASCVD and no other 
identifiable risk factors, or a family history of premature ASCVD or high 
Lp(a) levels, or in individuals at moderate risk or around treatment deci­
sion thresholds to improve risk classification. Lp(a) levels may increase 
after menopause and a second measurement is reasonable, particularly 
if the pre-menopausal levels were borderline.78,91 For Lp(a) measure­
ment, there is substantial variability among different assays, in part relat­
ing to apo(a) structure and variability in Kringle-IV repeats, potentially 
under- or overestimating Lp(a) levels. Although measurement in molar 
units (nmol/L) is preferred, mass units (mg/dL) can be used for clinical 
purposes.
Although Lp(a) has not yet been shown to improve risk prediction 
on top of currently recommended scores (SCORE2, SCORE2-OP), 
another study testing whether elevated Lp(a) could improve MI risk 
prediction beyond conventional risk factors showed that Lp(a) con­
centrations >47 mg/dL reclassified 23% of first MI events correctly, 
while no events were reclassified incorrectly, in a cohort of 8720 
individuals.84
Whether lowering Lp(a) reduces the risk of ASCVD and AVS pro­
gression has yet to be shown; the extent of Lp(a) lowering required 
for clinical benefit is also not known. In the absence of specific 
Lp(a)-lowering therapies, early risk factor management and more in­
tensive LDL-C lowering is reasonable, considering both absolute CV 
risk and Lp(a) levels.78 An online Lp(a) risk and benefit algorithm 
is available at http://www.eas-society.org/LPA_risk_and_benefit_ 
algorithm. Although small studies have suggested that statins may 
have a slight Lp(a) increasing effect, individual-level data on partici­
pants in seven randomized, placebo-controlled, statin outcome 
trials found that statins had no effect on Lp(a) concentrations.92
Therefore, clinical decision-making should be influenced by the de­
gree of Lp(a) elevation and the patient’s other risk factors, and pa­
tients with high levels of Lp(a) should be strongly encouraged to 
take or continue to take high-intensity statins if their risk is sufficiently 
high.93
Currently, there are specific Lp(a)-lowering medications being tested 
in randomized clinical trials. The injectable RNA (either antisense oligo­
nucleotide or small interfering RNA)-based therapies that target apoli­
poprotein(a) production in the hepatocyte lower Lp(a) concentration 
by 80%–98%.94–97 An oral small molecule inhibitor and a small interfer­
ing RNA that can lower Lp(a) significantly are currently under investi­
gation.98–100
Recommendation Table 4 includes a new recommendation reflecting 
the increase in CV risk across the spectrum of elevated Lp(a) levels.1 It 
is reasonable to consider elevated Lp(a) levels >50 mg/dL (≥105 nmol/ 
L) (affecting at least 20% of the population)83 in order to refine CV 
risk estimation across the spectrum of CV risk; moreover, this cut-off le­
vel should be considered as a risk modifier to potentially reclassify the CV 
risk category specifically in individuals at moderate risk or individuals close 
to treatment decision thresholds (see Box 1 and Recommendation 
Table 1).

### 7 Hypertriglyceridaemia

Triglyceride levels are associated with CV risk independent of LDL-C 
levels.102–104
With 
respect 
to 
pharmacological 
treatment 
of hypertriglyceridaemia, this Task Force continues to recommend 
statins as the first drug of choice to reduce CVD risk in high-risk 
patients.1
Currently available fibrates (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, bezafibrate) 
have moderate triglyceride-lowering effects.105–107 Fenofibrate and be­
zafibrate lead to small decreases in LDL-C, but have not reduced MACE 
(MI, ischaemic stroke, CV mortality) or total mortality in patients trea­
ted with statins. A reduction in non-fatal MI was only seen in subgroup 
analyses of patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia (low HDL-C and 
high triglycerides) in these trials.105,106 In a pre-specified subgroup ana­
lysis of the FIELD (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering 
in Diabetes) trial, fenofibrate was associated with a lower risk of 
lower-limb amputations, likely not mediated by lipid-related mechan­
isms.108 The PROMINENT (Pemafibrate to Reduce Cardiovascular 
OutcoMes by Reducing Triglycerides IN PatiENts With DiabeTes) trial 
recently showed that the selective peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor (PPAR-a) modulator pemafibrate109 did not reduce the risk 
of MACE in 10 497 patients with T2DM, mild-to-moderate hypertrigly­
ceridaemia and low HDL-C levels; notably, pemafibrate increased ApoB 
and LDL-C levels in that trial. Overall, in contrast to the robust evidence 
of ASCVD risk reduction with LDL-C lowering therapies, the efficacy of 
triglyceride lowering with fibrates in reducing ASCVD risk has not been 
established. This Focused Update supports the Class IIb recommenda­
tions of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the use of fenofibrate or be­
zafibrate.1 Fibrates are not indicated to lower serum cholesterol or 
LDL-C levels.110
Regarding n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the STRENGTH 
trial was published following the publication of the 2019 ESC/EAS 
Guidelines.1 The trial failed to demonstrate benefit of a combined 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prepar­
ation in 13 078 patients (70% with diabetes; 56% with established 
ASCVD) in lowering MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, non- 
fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina 
requiring hospitalization).8

Reasons for the discordant results of the negative STRENGTH trial 
vs those of the positive REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular 
Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial),111 which were pub­
lished 2 years earlier, may be related to differences in the study popu­
lations, active treatment compounds (mixture of EPA and DHA vs 
high-dose icosapent ethyl, i.e. a highly purified EPA ethyl ester, re­
spectively), or placebo formulation (corn oil vs mineral oil-containing 
placebo, respectively).112–114 Proposed mechanisms of action of how 
EPA specifically reduces cardiovascular risk are the distinct effects on 
lipid oxidation, inflammation, membrane structure/organization, chol­
esterol domain formation, and endothelial function.115,116 In view of 
the newer evidence from the STRENGTH trial, this Focused 
Update revised the respective recommendation for PUFAs by expli­
citly stating that high-dose icosapent ethyl (as in the REDUCE-IT trial) 
should be considered for high-risk or very high-risk patients with ele­
vated triglyceride levels (fasting triglyceride level 135-499 mg/dL 
[1.52-5.63 mmol/L]) despite statin therapy to lower CVD events 
(Recommendation Table 5).
Volanesorsen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting hepatic apoli­
poprotein C-III (ApoC-III) messenger RNA that lowers plasma levels of 
ApoC-III, triglycerides, and chylomicrons. In a phase III, double-blind, 
randomized 52 week trial including 66 patients with familial chylomicro­
naemia syndrome (FCS) and markedly elevated triglyceride levels 
(mean baseline levels 2209 mg/dL [24.96 mmol/L]), volanesorsen was 
shown to lower triglyceride levels by 77% within 3 months; levels 
<750 mg/dL (<8.48 mmol/L) were achieved in 77% of volanesorsen- 
treated patients. Common adverse events include thrombocytopenia 
requiring frequent monitoring and injection-site reactions in 60% of 
the patients treated with volanesorsen.6 A meta-analysis of individual 
patient data from three randomized controlled trials including pa­
tients with triglyceride levels >500 mg/dL (>5.65 mmol/L) (n = 207) 
showed a significant reduction in the risk of acute pancreatitis during 
a median follow-up of 8.1 months.117 Volanesorsen has been ap­
proved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [but not by the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] as an adjunct to diet in adult 
patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancrea­
titis in whom response to diet and triglyceride-lowering therapy has 
been inadequate. This drug should be considered for patients with 
severe hypertriglyceridaemia due to FCS (new recommendation in 
Recommendation Table 5).
Currently, new triglyceride-lowering medications are being 
tested in randomized clinical trials. Injectable RNA-based therapies 
(either antisense oligonucleotide or small interfering RNA) targeting 
ApoC-III can lower triglyceride concentrations by up to 80% 
depending on the dose, interval, specific agent, and patient popula­
tion.118–121
8. Primary prevention in people 
with human immunodeficiency 
virus infection
People with HIV (PWH) have a two-fold increased risk of ASCVD com­
pared with the general population.17,122 Underlying mechanisms in­
clude chronic inflammation, immune activation, dyslipidaemia caused 
by antiretroviral therapy (ART), and traditional CV risk factors.123
Cardiovascular risk is often underestimated in PWH using conventional 
risk prediction tools.124 In the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines,1 the recom­
mendation was that lipid-lowering therapy (mostly statins) should be 
considered in HIV patients with dyslipidaemia to achieve the LDL-C 
goal as defined for high-risk patients (Class IIa, Level C). The recently 
published REPRIEVE trial justifies an update in the recommendation 
for statins in PWH. REPRIEVE was a multicentre, randomized, double- 
blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 7769 participants in pri­
mary prevention with HIV, aged 40 to 75 years with low-to-moderate 
ASCVD risk receiving ART.7 Patients were randomized to pitavastatin 
4 mg once daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was MACE, a com­
posite of CV death, MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, stroke, tran­
sient ischaemic attack, peripheral arterial ischaemia, revascularization, 
or death from an undetermined cause. The trial was stopped prema­
turely for efficacy after a median follow-up of 5.1 years, and showed 
a 35% lower incidence of MACE in the pitavastatin vs the placebo 
group (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48–0.90; P = .002). Efficacy was similar 
for men and women—an important finding as women have a higher 
risk of HIV-associated ASCVD.125 Of note, rates of muscle-related 
symptoms and new-onset diabetes were higher in PWH treated with 
pitavastatin (2.4% vs 1.3% and 5.3% vs 4.0%, respectively). The 5 year 
number needed to treat to prevent one MACE was 106. In the 
REPRIEVE trial, pitavastatin 4 mg daily did not interact with antiretro­
viral drugs; as co-administration of certain statins and specific antiretro­
viral drugs may result in significant drug interactions, the choice of statin 
should be based on potential drug interactions.126 The new recommen­
dation in this Focused Update for statin therapy in PWH aged ≥40 
years in primary prevention is included in Recommendation Table 6.
Although outcome trials of other lipid-lowering therapies have not 
been performed in PWH, data on LDL-C reduction and tolerability 
are available for ezetimibe and PCSK9 mAbs.
Ezetimibe as monotherapy or in combination with statin therapy re­
duces LDL-C levels in PWH receiving ART to a similar extent as in peo­
ple without HIV and is well tolerated, although available studies are 
small.127–129 Regarding PCSK9 inhibitors, a randomized, double-blind 
trial including 464 PWH receiving ART (35.6% with documented 
ASCVD) showed that evolocumab reduced LDL-C levels by 56.9%

9. Patients with cancer at high or 
very high chemotherapy-related 
cardiovascular toxicity risk
Anthracycline-based chemotherapy is a key component of several 
chemotherapy regimens for many types of cancer (e.g. breast cancer 
or lymphoma). Its use is associated with the development of heart fail­
ure in up to 20% of patients within 5 years, depending on the accumu­
lated dose received.131
Recently, four randomized trials assessed the cardioprotective role 
of statins in patients with cancer receiving anthracycline-based ther­
apy.9,132–134 The STOP-CA trial was a multicentre, double-blind, ran­
domized controlled trial comparing atorvastatin 40 mg daily against 
placebo in 300 patients with lymphoma. The primary endpoint, defined 
as the proportion of patients with ≥10% absolute decline in left ven­
tricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to a final LVEF value <55% at 12 
months, occurred more frequently in the placebo compared with the 
atorvastatin group (22% vs 9%, respectively; P = .002).9 Three smaller 
trials yielded mixed results132–134 (see supplementary data online), 
which may be explained by differences in patient populations, CV 
risk, sample sizes, outcomes, or follow-up duration. Although the evi­
dence supporting the use of statins as cardioprotective treatment for 
anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is not unequivocal, this Focused 
Update supports the Class IIa recommendation introduced in the 
2022 ESC cardio-onocology Guidelines135 for statin treatment in pa­
tients at high or very high risk of developing cancer therapy-related 
CV toxicity (new recommendation in Recommendation Table 7). This 
was based on the net positive results of the largest of these trials 
(STOP-CA) and two meta-analyses of available randomized trials (in­
cluding unblinded trials),136,137 in combination with the overall safety 
of statins without reported increase in hepatotoxicity or myopathy in 
this setting.9,132–134
The effects of non-statin lipid-lowering therapies on LVEF or other 
cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving cancer therapy have 
not been tested.
10. Dietary supplements
The role of healthy dietary habits in lowering atherogenic lipid levels 
and reducing CV risk is discussed in detail in the 2019 ESC/EAS 
Guidelines.1 A healthy diet is generally defined as a dietary pattern 
low in saturated fat, with a focus on wholegrain products, vegetables, 
fruit, and fish.1 With respect to dietary supplements, however, there 
has not been compelling evidence that these can reduce CV risk. For 
red yeast rice preparations, although a clinically relevant hypocholes­
terolaemic effect has been reported with selected (purified, high- 
dose) preparations, convincing evidence of a clinical benefit resulting 
from this treatment is missing. Similarly, there has not been evidence 
that supplementation with PUFAs can lower LDL-C levels or reduce 
the risk of CV events—with the exception of high-dose, purified ico­
sapent ethyl used in the context of hypertriglyceridaemia. Along the 
same lines, the recently published OMEMI trial that tested PUFA 
(DHA + EPA) in elderly patients (age 70–82 years) without elevated 
triglycerides with recent (2–8 weeks) acute MI did not show a reduc­
tion in clinical events compared with placebo.11 The recent SPORT 
trial was a single-centre, randomized, single-blind study in persons 
without history of ASCVD and an increased 10 year risk of ASCVD. 
Participants (n = 199) were randomized to rosuvastatin 5 mg daily, 
placebo, fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast 
rice. At 28 days, LDL-C reduction (the study’s primary endpoint) was 
greater with rosuvastatin than with all supplements or placebo, and 
none of the dietary supplements led to a significant LDL-C reduction 
compared with placebo.10 Phytosterols reduce cholesterol absorp­
tion in the intestinal lumen and increase cholesterol excretion, and 
at doses of up to 2 grams per day they can reduce LDL-C levels by 
approximately 10% without reported adverse events. There are no 
studies showing benefit of phytosterols on CV outcomes.138 In June 
2022, the European Parliament and the Council prohibited the mar­
keting of food supplements containing ≥3 mg/day of monacolins 
from red yeast rice. Concretely, this corresponds to a ban on mona­
colins from red yeast rice at a daily dose of ≥3 mg/day, while lower 
doses of these supplements are under restrictions (warnings) and 
European Union scrutiny.139
Based on the totality of available evidence and in view of the new 
trials published after 2019,10,11 this Focused Update does not support 
the use of dietary supplements or vitamins without documented safety 
and significant LDL-C-lowering efficacy for lowering the risk of ASCVD 
(new recommendation in Recommendation Table 8).

Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Clinical Consensus Statement fully into account when exercising their clinical 
judgement, as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies; however, 
the ESC Clinical Consensus Statement does not override, in any way whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health professionals to 
make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient and, 
where appropriate and/or necessary, the patient’s caregiver. Nor does the ESC Clinical Consensus Statement exempt health 
professionals from taking into full and careful consideration the relevant official updated recommendations or guidelines issued by the 
competent public health authorities, in order to manage each patient’s case in light of the scientifically accepted data pursuant to their 
respective ethical and professional obligations. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the applicable rules and regulations 
relating to drugs and medical devices prior to making any clinical decision and to check whether a more recent version of this document 
exists. The ESC warns readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect.

1. Preamble
ESC Clinical Consensus Statements, developed under the auspices of 
the ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee, evaluate and summar­
ize available evidence with the aim of assisting health professionals in 
proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic approach for an individual 
patient with a given condition. ESC Clinical Consensus Statements are 
intended for use by health professionals but do not override their indi­
vidual responsibility to make appropriate and accurate decisions in con­
sideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with 
the patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or neces­
sary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules 
and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the 
time of prescription and to respect the ethical rules of their profession.
ESC Clinical Consensus Statements represent the official position of 
the ESC on a given topic. ESC Policies and Procedures for formulating 
and issuing ESC Guidelines and documents developed under the 
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                                 5

auspices of the ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee can be found 
on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical- 
Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines).
This Task Force was selected by the ESC to include professionals in­
volved with the medical care of patients with this pathology and to include 
patient representatives and methodologists. The selection procedure in­
cluded an open call for authors and aimed to include members from 
across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty 
Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion.
Clinical consensus statement Task Forces perform a critical review 
and evaluation of the published literature on diagnostic and therapeutic 
approaches including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Evidence ta­
bles summarizing key information from relevant studies are generated 
to facilitate the formulation of management consensus statements, to 
enhance their comprehension after publication, and to reinforce trans­
parency in the clinical consensus statement development process. The 
tables are published in their own section of the ESC Clinical Consensus 
Statement and reference specific recommendation tables.
After an iterative process of deliberations, a modified Delphi process 
on all management consensus statements was conducted. The Task 
Force members ranked their level of agreement or disagreement 
with each management consensus statement using the Likert ordinal 
scale: strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strong­
ly disagree, recuse. Consensus of agreement was inferred if >75% of 
the respondents selected the options ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’.
The writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest 
forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential 
sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest were re­
viewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules which can be 
found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/doi) and were 
compiled in a report published in a supplementary document with 
the Clinical Consensus Statement. Funding for the development of 
ESC Clinical Consensus Statements is derived entirely from the ESC 
with no involvement of the healthcare industry.
The CPG Committee supervises and co-ordinates the preparation 
of new clinical consensus statements and approves their publication. In add­
ition to review by the CPG Committee, ESC Clinical Consensus Statements 
undergo multiple rounds of double-blind peer review on a dedicated online 
review platform. The review is conducted by topic experts, including mem­
bers from ESC National Cardiac Societies and from relevant ESC 
Subspecialty Communities. Guideline Task Forces consider all review com­
ments and are required to respond to all those classified as major. After ap­
propriate revisions, Task Force and the CPG Committee members 
approve the final document for publication in the European Heart Journal.
Unless otherwise stated, ESC Clinical Consensus Statement content 
refers to sex, understood as the biological condition of being male or 
female, defined by genes, hormones, and sexual organs. Off-label use 
of medication may be presented in this Guideline if a sufficient level 
of evidence shows that it can be considered medically appropriate 
for a given condition. However, decisions on off-label use must be 
made by the responsible health professional giving special consideration 
to ethical rules concerning healthcare, the specific situation of the pa­
tient, patient consent, and country-specific health regulations.
2. The scope of this consensus 
statement
This consensus statement provides readers with insights into the extent 
and magnitude of the impact of mental health on cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and vice versa. It also outlines how the negative impacts of this 
reciprocal relationship can be prevented or minimized. Clinical cardio­
vascular (CV) practice often overlooks the impact of mental health and 
the importance of its inclusion in CV care; this needs to change. 
Therefore, this consensus statement sets out to be broad and ambi­
tious. The high burden of concomitant CVD and mental health condi­
tions requires a new integrated approach to caring for people with 
CVD. Cardiovascular health professionals need to develop collabora­
tions with mental health professionals to provide guidance for practice 
and appropriate support for people with CVD and their caregivers. 
Whilst challenging, healthcare professionals are encouraged to pursue 
the implementation of the suggestions in this statement, regardless of 
their profession, clinical setting, or resources. Changes in the current 
models of care, with structure and resource adjustments, may require 
both centre-specific and country-specific measures. Consequently, the 
document adopts a global perspective and reviews the evidence 
on the association between mental and CV health, as well as tackling 
key aspects such as awareness, communication, screening, optimal 
management, stigma, gaps in evidence, and needs for research. A com­
prehensive and inclusive perspective has also prompted the use of re­
spectful language in healthcare.1 People with lived experience of CVD 
and mental health conditions have been central in the creation of this 
document, and their perspectives underpin the importance of changing 
practice, and emphasize the need for implementation of the steps sug­
gested in this statement.
2.1. Methods employed in the consensus 
statement
This consensus document involved a multidisciplinary team of cardiol­
ogists, nurses, general professionals, psychologists, psychiatrists, geria­
tricians, and people with experience of mental health and CV 
conditions. It was developed under the auspices of the ESC Clinical 
Practice Guidelines Committee. The Task Force Chairs proposed the 
document structure; this was subsequently refined through group in­
put, with section leaders ensuring consistency, coherence, and clinical 
relevance. Literature reviews are comprehensively presented within 
evidence tables. Relevant, clinically tangible information is summarized 
within the text for the benefit of the clinical professional. Multiple meet­
ings were held to discuss the available evidence and the relative strength 
of that evidence.
On the basis of the evidence reviews and discussion, the Task Force 
identified that there is limited evidence to guide practice, despite the 
clear and important multidirectional interaction between mental health 
and CVD. As a result of the dearth of research, the Task Force adopted 
a modified Delphi process to generate main recommendations. The 
modified Delphi process is a structured communication technique 
that allows a group of experts to gather opinions on a given complex 
or controversial topic, for which there is insufficient evidence or incom­
plete knowledge.2 The modified Delphi questionnaire included manage­
ment consensus statements. These statements summarize factors from 
each section and typically consist of actions or practical suggestions that 
healthcare professionals should endeavor to implement in their prac­
tice. As these are based on limited evidence, the Task Force members 
ranked their level of agreement or disagreement with each manage­
ment consensus statement using the Likert ordinal scale: strongly agree, 
agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree, recuse. 
Consensus of agreement was inferred if >75% of the respondents se­
lected the options ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’. Consensus was reached 
for all the proposed management consensus statements following the

first round of voting. A total of 34 management consensus statements 
are presented in this document. Section summary points represent im­
portant components of the section that a healthcare professional 
should be aware of. They were also reviewed and revised by the 
Task Force, to ensure that they reflected the key elements of each sec­
tion. Section summary points and management consensus statements 
are presented at the end of each section.
3. Introduction
3.1. The relationship between mental and 
cardiovascular health and disease
Mental health is an integral component of a person’s health. According 
to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is a state of 
mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, 
realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their 
community.3 Despite its importance, there is not a single agreed defin­
ition for mental health.4
Although mental health and mental illness are sometimes considered 
as dual continua, for the purpose of this document, mental health is an 
overarching concept of a complex continuum spanning from optimal 
mental health with dominant features such as optimism, resilience, 
and well-being, to negative mental health states including severe mental 
illness (Figure 1).5 The nomenclature surrounding negative aspects and 
mental health disturbances also lacks consistent definitions. Mental 
health condition is a wide term that will be used in this document to 
refer to psychosocial difficulties and other mental states associated 
with distress, impairment in cognitive functioning, altered emotional re­
sponses, altered behaviour, and risk of self-harm. Within mental health 
conditions, mental health disorders refer to mental health states char­
acterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cogni­
tion, emotional regulation, or behaviour, usually associated with 
distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.3 Mental health 
disorders include severe mental illnesses (SMI) defined by a significantly 
impaired level of psychosocial functioning (Figure 1).6 In relation to the 
latter, we have drawn upon definitions and diagnostic criteria for men­
tal health conditions that are specified in the International Classification 
of Diseases for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics, Eleventh Revision.7
Organic mental health disorders, such as cognitive impairment and de­
mentia, are outside the scope of this document.
This consensus statement will address mental health conditions 
across the spectrum of severity and type, as both people with symp­
toms of suboptimal mental health identified through screening, and 
people with manifest mental health disorders, are at high CVD risk. 
Core principles, across the spectrum of disease, are outlined. To illus­
trate the impact and implementation of some of the key aspects of the 
document, the narratives of people living with CVD and clinical cases 
have been incorporated into the online document ‘Clinical cases and 
patient perspectives’.

Mental health and mental health conditions interact with CV health 
(defined as the health of the heart and blood vessels)8 and CVD in a 
multidirectional way (Figure 2). For example: 
• Positive features of mental health at an individual and societal level are 
associated with better CV health,9–11 while people with mental 
health conditions are more likely to be at greater risk of CVD.12
• Acute CV events or chronic CVD impact on mental health, worsen­
ing pre-existing mental conditions or triggering new conditions.13–16
• The concurrence of CVD and mental health conditions may interact, 
worsening both mental health and CV prognosis.17–19
• People with mental health conditions are often the most disadvan­
taged, experiencing social and economic hardship as well as dealing 
with stigma, stereotypes, and prejudice.20
• People with mental health disorders, particularly SMI, are more 
vulnerable, and are less likely to receive the same diagnostic 
and treatment efforts as persons without mental health condi­
tions.21–26

3.2. Enduring problems
Despite the strong association between mental health, CV health, and 
CVD, and its clinical relevance, there are multiple problems (Figure 2) 
including: 
• Insufficient awareness among healthcare professionals of the preva­
lence of mental health conditions in the population and their impact 
on increasing risk of developing CVD.27
• Limited appreciation among healthcare professionals of the incidence 
and prevalence of mental health conditions and mental disorders 
among people with CVD and their impact on quality of life (QoL), 
therapeutic adherence, and CVD prognosis.27
• Inadequate recognition of the stigma of SMI in society and in health­
care, and its consequences for people coping with SMI, their family, 
and caregivers.28
• Lack of systematic and appropriate screening, evaluation, communi­
cation, and management of mental health, which are not integrated in 
routine clinical CV practice.29
• Little knowledge and ongoing research about how to improve CV 
health and prevent CVD in people with mental health conditions 
and mental disorders.21–23,27
• Limited evidence and ongoing research on the best ways to commu­
nicate, promote, maintain, and improve mental health and resilience 
in people with CVD and their family members.30
• Little guidance about how to improve the care of people with SMI, 
despite strong evidence that people with SMI and CVD have worse 
CV prevention, acute and chronic care, and prognosis.21,24–26
• Limited awareness of the importance of family and caregivers and 
their needs, as both CVD and mental health conditions affect a per­
son’s wider social network.31–34
Cardiovascular care is optimal when it is person-centred and seeks 
to improve overall health, not only CV but also mental health, as an in­
tegral component. This approach needs to be integrated into routine 
practice as most current models of CV care do not consider mental 
health as a primary goal. To achieve this, healthcare professionals 
need more comprehensive information about mental health and how 
to deliver mental health sensitive, person-centred care. Furthermore, 
the mental health challenges experienced by family members and care­
givers are often not recognized nor addressed.35 Central to this state­
ment is the recognition that CV care professionals need to develop 
collaboration with mental health professionals in order to ensure opti­
mal care and outcomes. Access to mental health services may vary, but 
the multidisciplinary CV team needs to include a collaborating mental 
health professional, psychologist, or psychiatrist to provide guidance 
for practice and appropriate support for people with CVD and their 
caregivers. In this consensus statement, we have called this the 
Psycho-Cardio team (Figure 3).

3.3. Aims of the document
This document adopts a broad, summarizing approach, and provides 
key and consensus statements which collectively: 
• Critically review the evidence on the association between mental and 
CV health.
• Increase awareness of the clinical importance of the association be­
tween mental and CV health.
• Increase awareness and combat the stigma of mental health condi­
tions and mental health disorders.
• Promote increased mental health screening and better management 
for people with CVD and mental health conditions and support for 
caregivers.
• Provide guidance on initial clinical, systemic, and organizational 
changes needed, as well as signposting future directions.
• Identify gaps in evidence and research needed to improve the care for 
people with mental health conditions and CVD.
3.4. The Psycho-Cardio team
Multidisciplinary teams are needed to offer a holistic approach to health 
promotion and management in people with CVD and mental health 
conditions. In addition to CV and mental health professionals, the 
Psycho-Cardio team should be augmented by allied professionals, as ap­
propriate.36 Care continuity should be ensured via co-ordination with 
the multidisciplinary primary care team, and psychosocial determinants 
and potential social interventions discussed with social workers and 
relevant professionals. All professionals should advocate for improved 
mental health and CV care; those with advocacy responsibilities within 
the public health and policy domain should ensure changes recom­
mended here are priorities. A practical approach to change routine clin­
ical CV care towards being more person-centred is to focus on 
awareness toward the person with CVD and caregivers’ mental health, 
CV prevention, and care of people with mental health conditions fol­
lowing the ACTIVE principles (Figure 4). 
• First, acknowledge (A) the intricate relationship between mental 
health, CV health, and CVD, their common and specific determi­
nants, and the influence that mental health conditions may have on 
prognosis and care equity. Particular attention is required to identify 
and eliminate potential bias, disparities and stigma associated with 
mental health conditions and disorders, particularly in those with SMI.
• Second, check (C) systematically for the presence of symptoms of 
mental health conditions or mental health disorders at CV visits, 
and check CV risk factors during mental health visits.
• Third, use validated tools (T) to assess mental and CV health 
status among people with CVD, and use tools to inform and 
educate about the importance of mental and CV health, and their 
relationships.

• Fourth, implement (I) person-centred practices in CV care using 
evidence-based, stepped care approaches. These should be individua­
lized to the person and their circumstances and recognize the im­
portance of caregivers and caregivers’ health status.
• Fifth, venture (V) to convince professionals, managers, and people liv­
ing with CVD, to obtain their collaboration, support, and resources 
to make the needed structural and functional changes to face this 
challenge. These will not occur spontaneously. Professionals and in­
stitutions willing to improve CV and mental healthcare through col­
laborative, person-centred models, with compassionate support for 
families and caregivers will undoubtedly face several barriers when 
implementing change.
• Sixth, evaluate (E) the current status of routine CV care in each set­
ting and estimate the needs for organizational, educational, and clin­
ical support to implement the required changes. Progress in 
management and mental health outcomes will also have to be evalu­
ated for quality assurance and improvement purposes.

Section 3
4. Impact of mental health on the 
risk of developing cardiovascular 
disease
This section focuses on the relationship between mental health and CV 
risk in individuals without known CVD. The aim is to elucidate for the 
healthcare professional the aetiological impact of psychosocial stress 
factors on the onset of CVD. The evidence, which includes large 
population-based studies and meta-analyses that adjust or control for 
concurrent somatic risk factors, is robust. Such evidence underscores 
the independent impact of psychosocial risk factors on the prediction 
of hard endpoints including all-cause mortality, and major adverse car­
diac events (MACE).
4.1. Positive mental health states as 
predictors of better cardiovascular health
Subjective well-being (SWB) is an overarching term that covers dif­
ferent aspects of positive mental affect states.3 An individual with 
SWB is satisfied with life, has a sense of purpose, and possesses 
meaning in life.37 Related features to positive affectivity encompass 
psychological well-being, high life satisfaction, joy, optimism, and 
happiness.38 Sexual health is also an important component of mental 
well-being and can be impaired both as a cause or as a consequence 
of mental and CV issues.39 Positive trait-like dispositions like sense 
of coherence, a person’s view of life, and capacity to respond to 
stressful situations,40 and other more psychobiological-driven per­
sonality factors (i.e. emotional vitality, vigour, positive energy, and 
resilience) are further linked concepts employed in population- 
based studies.
Subjective well-being and related features have been advocated as 
protective states against premature mortality and morbidity, mainly fo­
cusing on CVD conditions. Systematic review and meta-analytic evi­
dence have shown favourable effects on mortality.41,42 In the largest 
meta-analysis, the survival impact of SWB was significant in both men 
and women, however, more protective in men.42 Positive affect was as­
sociated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD),43 and op­
timism with a lower incidence of heart failure (HF).44 Consecutive 
studies have demonstrated the importance of sexual well-being in over­
all well-being in CVD.39 Lastly, negative affect, a component of SWB, 
has also been shown to increase incident CVD events, even after con­
trolling for known confounders.45
Mechanistically, SWB may have stress-buffering properties that di­
minish physiological hyper-responsiveness46 or exert protective CV ef­
fects via a more balanced physiology (i.e. autonomic regulation, 
enhanced neuroendocrine functioning, reduced inflammation).47
Alternatively, SWB may result in greater engagement in healthy beha­
viours,48 that in turn drive better social functioning, personal relation­
ships, and QoL.49
4.2. Psychosocial stress
Psychosocial stress arises when an individual perceives and responds to 
a social demand (family issues, social isolation, financial pressures, and 
work) that exceeds an individual’s adaptive capacity or regulatory 
homeostatic range to cope.50,51 The same situation can be stressful 
for one person but not for another, due to psychological appraisal pro­
cesses that typically operate outside of conscious awareness.52 In most 
cases, psychosocial stress results in an appropriate state of arousal

Mental health and mental health conditions interact with CV health 
and CVD in a multidirectional way.
(ii)
The coexistence of CVD and mental health conditions can create a 
mutual interaction that worsens both mental and CV health, 
leading to poorer outcomes.
(iii)
Routine CV clinical practice lacks integrated, systematic and 
appropriate screening, evaluation, communication, and 
management of mental health.
(iv)
There is limited evidence on the best ways to communicate, 
promote, maintain, and improve mental health and resilience in 
people with CVD and their family members.
(v)
The evidence base to guide practice in relation to the screening and 
management of mental health conditions in people with CVD is 
limited.
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Cardiovascular care is optimal if it is person-centred and seeks to 
improve overall health, not only CV but also mental health, as an 
integral component.
(ii)
A multidisciplinary team including mental health professionals, 
psychologists, and/or psychiatrists (Psycho-Cardio team) is needed 
in CV care to provide guidance for practice and appropriate mental 
health assessment, support, and management to people with CVD 
and their caregivers.
(iii)
Cardiovascular services should aspire to implement a Psycho-Cardio 
team approach, tailored to the local population, context, and 
resources.
(iv)
Implementing the ACTIVE principles is a practical approach to 
transform routine clinical CV care towards being more 
person-centred, integrating mental healthcare into routine CV 
practice to improve care.

and hyper-mobilization53 that is contextually applicable.52 However, 
clinically more important are long-term sustained stress conditions 
(chronic stress) which cause exacerbated pathophysiological changes 
in the heart and vasculature. Various psychosocial risk factors are de­
scribed below and illustrated in Figure 5.
Psychosocial factors as a whole are as potent risk factors as conven­
tional risk factors, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.51 [95% con­
fidence interval (CI) 2.15–2.93].54 Chronic psychological stress is 
associated with an increased risk of CVD.55 People experiencing their 
first myocardial infarction (MI) reported higher prevalence of stress 
(work home, financial, major life events) in the 12 months prior to ad­
mission; the highest risk was for permanent stress at work (OR 2.14; 
99% CI 1.73–2.64). The increased risk is consistent across regions, 
ethnic groups, men, and women.56 Stress can trigger CVD events 
through: (i) changes in autonomic balance, (ii) alteration of neuroen­
docrine axes, (iii) activation of inflammatory systems, and (iv) engage­
ment in health-damaging behaviours like smoking and alcohol 
consumption.57 The latter typically cluster significantly with stress ex­
posure.57 Management of psychosocial stress and promotion of men­
tal well-being should therefore be integral parts of comprehensive CV 
healthcare and prevention.
4.3. Work stress and unemployment
Most individuals spend a major portion of their active lives in work envir­
onments, which can be a source of psychosocial stress. A large-scale 
meta-analysis demonstrated that work stress/job strain was significantly as­
sociated with a higher risk for CHD.58 In equally large prospective cohort 
studies, job strain was associated with shorter chronic disease-free life ex­
pectancy,59 and loss of chronic disease-free life expectancy.60 Workplace 
bullying at baseline increased risk of CHD or stroke by 59% and by 25% 
over more than 12 years of follow-up in those who reported physical vio­
lence or threat of violence at work after adjustment for confounders.61
Reduced life expectancy is likely driven through increased CVD risk 
factors. Strong evidence links work stress to increased risk of hyperten­
sion,62 insomnia,63 and negative affectivity.64 Further, effects can be cu­
mulative.65 Maladaptive compensatory behaviour patterns (smoking,66
physical inactivity,67 self-damaging alcohol consumption, and other un­
healthy lifestyle patterns)68 also drive work-related stress burdens that 
can result in CVD.69 Unemployed persons have equally high prevalences 
of unhealthy lifestyles, biological CV risk factors, and CVD.70–73 Work 
stress is therefore an important mediator of CVD risk and outcome. If 
people with CVD voice concern about work stress, they should be 
appropriately counselled as suggested in Section 5.

4.4. Socioeconomic and subjective social 
status
Low socioeconomic status (SES) is an independent risk factor for 
CVD.74 Subjective social status (SSS), which refers to the ‘individual’s 
perception of his or her own position in the social hierarchy’,75 is 
also an important mediator of CVD risk. Risk appears to be mediated 
through lifestyle pathways, however, it is increased via delayed or poor 
CVD management.76 Whilst healthcare professionals may be limited in 
their ability to address these factors, there remains a need to advocate 
for social policies to address inequalities in SES for those with such a 
remit.
4.5. Perceived discrimination
Lifetime discrimination (experiences of unfair treatment in various life 
domains) and everyday discrimination (frequency of day-to-day occur­
rences of perceived unfair treatment), and related features like social 
stigmatization, have been linked to CVD.77 Multiple studies have de­
monstrated that lifetime discrimination increases CVD risk or all-cause 
mortality even after adjustment for important confounders.77–80 The 
strength of the evidence suggests that discrimination is important, 
thus people describing discrimination in the clinical setting should be ap­
propriately counselled in terms of prevention of health hazards.
4.6. Mental stress through impaired social 
relationships
There are multiple avenues through which mental stress can drive CVD 
risk and prognosis. Important categories of mental stress are summar­
ized below.
4.6.1. Adverse childhood experiences
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are broadly defined as ‘child­
hood events, varying in severity and often chronic, occurring in a child’s 
family or social environment that cause harm or distress, thereby dis­
rupting the child’s physical or psychological health and development’.81
These events include physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, neglect, care­
giver mental illness, and domestic violence.81 Several studies comparing 
adults with and without ACEs exposure have shown higher incidence of 
CVD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression, and all-cause mortality.82–86
Healthcare professionals must be aware of the relationship between 
ACEs and CVD, and if described during clinical interview they should 
raise awareness to the potential health ramifications and refer these in­
dividuals to the appropriate preventative services.
4.6.2. Partnership violence
Intimate partner violence is associated with a greater prevalence of 
mental health conditions,87 and appears to be an additional stressor 
that directly and indirectly impacts women’s CV health. However, 
the findings across studies are inconsistent.88 Although the evidence 
is more limited in males, experiences of intimate partner violence, 
whether as victim or perpetrator, have been linked to increased 
CVD risk.89
4.6.3. Loneliness and social isolation
Loneliness is defined as a ‘subjective negative experience that results 
from inadequate meaningful connections, where “inadequate” refers 
to the discrepancy or unmet need between an individual’s preferred 
and actual experience’.90 Social isolation whilst conceptually similar 
is defined as ‘an objective “lack” or “absence” of social contact or 
relationships’.91 Evidence from meta-analyses and population-based 
cohort studies have determined that both loneliness and social 
isolation are associated with increased CVD risk.92,93 Healthcare 
professionals should be aware of the potential impact these experi­
ences have on CVD risk. Social prescribing may be a potential inter­
vention to improve social isolation and loneliness as discussed in 
Section 5.
4.7. Mental health conditions and 
personality traits as risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease
4.7.1. Depression
The WHO defines depressive disorder as a common mental condition 
that involves a low mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for 
long periods of time.94 Common symptoms are feelings of sadness, 
emptiness, hopelessness, having trouble concentrating, losing interest 
in things that one used to enjoy, feeling worthless, guilt, and experien­
cing disrupted sleep.94 Depressive mood is a normal reaction to severe 
adverse life events and problems (i.e. divorce, job loss). Diagnostic cri­
teria for depressive disorders are shown in Supplementary data online, 
Table S1. The prevalence of depression is estimated to be 4.4% in the 
general population (in total, 322 million globally) posing a significant 
public health challenge.94 Depression has been shown to be as strong 
a CV risk factor as traditional somatic risk factors.95,96 Large observa­
tional and case-control studies demonstrate that depression is inde­
pendently associated with incident CVD, all-cause mortality, and 
combined CVD/mortality outcome, with hazard ratios (HRs) or ORs 
ranging from 1.14 to 1.55.56,97 Meta-analyses have shown depression 
to confer increased risk for incident HF, new-onset and recurring atrial 
fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, and sudden cardiac 
death (SCD).98–101
4.7.2. Anxiety
Anxiety is an emotion characterized by worrying that may be accom­
panied by non-specific physical and psychological symptoms such as 
restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, 
or sleep disturbances.102 If it is intense and sudden, anxiety may present 
as a panic attack, with palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest 
pain, lightheadedness, or a dying sensation lasting several minutes.103
Fear and anxiety are closely related phenomena, but differ in terms 
of their orientation in time. Anxiety is ‘future-oriented’ (i.e. perceived/ 
anticipated threats), whilst fear is a reaction to a perceived imminent 
threat in the present.104
Anxiety or fear-related disorders are characterized by excessive fear 
and anxiety that cause distress or impairment in functioning. These dis­
orders include generalized anxiety, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific 
phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety, selective mutism, 
and other related disorders. Multiple studies and meta-analyses have 
shown that anxiety and anxiety disorders (together or individually) 
are associated with increased risk of CVD and/or CV mortality.105–109
The relationship between anxiety and arrhythmias or HF is less clear 
with mixed findings.100,109–111 Panic disorders and panic attacks have 
also been associated with incident CVD events.112 Overall, evidence 
suggests that the link between anxiety or fear and CVD risk is suffi­
cient that healthcare professionals should be aware of the relationship 
and consider early screening as clinically indicated. Diagnostic criteria 
for anxiety and fear-related disorders can be found in Supplementary 
data online, Table S2.

4.7.3. Post-traumatic stress disorder
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex and debilitating 
condition, often stemming from exposure to traumatic events that 
shatter a person’s sense of safety and security.113 Symptoms encom­
pass intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares, and heightened arousal, 
all of which can severely impair an individual’s QoL.114 Onset of PTSD 
can occur at any time during the lifespan following exposure to a trau­
matic event.
Post-traumatic stress disorder is an important risk factor for 
CVD, both in terms of its development and progression. PTSD 
among Armed Forces veterans has been linked to a 25%–50% 
higher risk of CVD, including HF, MI, and CVD mortality com­
pared with those without PTSD, even after adjustment for de­
pression and other factors.115–117 The mechanisms by which 
PTSD may increase CV risk are not fully understood. However, 
it has been shown that PTSD elicits psychological, physiological, 
and behavioural responses that lead to increased risk.118
Autonomic imbalance (increased activity of the sympathetic ner­
vous system and decreased activity of the parasympathetic ner­
vous system), damaged baroreflex function, and subsequent 
blood pressure dysregulation may also play a role.119 PTSD is 
also associated with elevated markers of inflammation,120 and of­
ten associated with unhealthy diet and lifestyle, obesity, sleep dis­
turbance, decreased physical activity, medication non-adherence, 
substance abuse, smoking, and alcohol abuse, all of which contrib­
ute to poor CV health.121–123 Definition and characteristics of 
PTSD can be found in Supplementary data online, Table S3. 
Symptoms and suggested key questions to identify depression, 
anxiety, or PTSD can be found in Supplementary data online, 
Tables S4–S6.
4.8. Section summary points and 
management consensus statements 
from Section 4
5. Mental health and mental health 
conditions in people with 
cardiovascular disease
The previous section focused on the analysis of CV risk associated with 
mental health conditions in individuals without CVD. This section ad­
dresses the prevalence of mental health conditions among people 
with CVD, their impact on CV prognosis, self-management and adher­
ence to medical recommendations, as well as the impact of CVD on the 
mental health of family members or caregivers.
5.1. Impact of cardiovascular disease on 
mental health
Cardiovascular disease can induce significant mental health conditions. 
The perceived characteristics of acute CV events, such as acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS) or arrhythmia, coupled with the threat of death and 
helplessness,124,125 may trigger intense negative emotional responses.126
Even when diagnostic criteria for mental health disorders are not met, 
people with CVD may experience existential concerns. These include 
fear of recurrence, apprehension about death, emotional and work- 
related stress, anger, grief, and worries about the well-being of family 
members.127,128 The need for complex treatment regimens and lifestyle 
changes negatively impacts QoL and general well-being, and may be dif­
ficult to initiate and maintain.129 Combined with the perceived loss of 
health and independence, these factors may contribute to an increased 
risk of developing mental health conditions in people with CVD.
In some instances, these reactions and symptoms might become 
severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of a mental health disorder, 
such as depression, anxiety, and even cardiac disease-induced PTSD 
(CDI-PTSD).13,125,126 The prevalence of mental health conditions in 
people with CVD varies widely based on type of CVD, individual char­
acteristics, life contexts, and assessment tools. Most importantly, these 
comorbid mental health conditions might impact self-management, 
adherence to medication prescriptions, diet, physical activity, and smok­
ing cessation plans, overall outcomes, and even prognosis in people 
with CVD.125,126 This association is particularly evident with stress 
and depression, where 1 year healthcare costs for society are 33% 
higher compared with those with CVD.130 Therefore, it is imperative 
to inform and educate CV care professionals about the mental 
health-related consequences of CVD.
5.2. Specific mental health conditions in 
people with cardiovascular disease: 
prevalence and prognostic impact
5.2.1. Depressive symptoms and depression
It is important to differentiate depressive symptoms from depression as 
the term ‘depression’ encompasses various meanings, spanning from 
temporary feelings of low mood to severe clinical conditions that are dis­
abling, recurrent, and severe. Moreover, some individuals exhibit a per­
sistently distressed personality with certain depressive traits. People 
coping with CVD may experience any of these distinct clusters of symp­
toms, however, the most prevalent type of depression observed follow­
ing ACS is an ‘adjustment disorder with depressed mood’.131 People 
meeting the criteria for major depressive disorder are at elevated risk 
for subsequent events and often experience significantly diminished 
QoL. Consequently, these individuals require focused efforts for identi­
fication, precise diagnosis, and dedicated management.132
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
Indicators of positive mental health, such as optimism, 
happiness, and high life satisfaction are associated with lower 
CV risk.
(ii)
Hazardous psychosocial factors (e.g. social isolation, financial 
pressures, and work) are associated with increased risk of 
developing CVD.
(iii)
Mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD are 
associated with an increased risk of developing CVD.
(iv)
Healthcare professionals have a responsibility to: 
• Be informed of these associations.
• Be alert to these risk factors during consultation.
• Inform, counsel, and refer individuals at risk as needed.
• Advocate for system changes as appropriate.
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Management of psychosocial stress and promotion of mental 
well-being are essential components of integrated CV 
prevention.
(ii)
Screening for depression, anxiety, and PTSD is advised to be 
integrated into CV risk assessment.

5.2.1.1. Prevalence of depressive symptoms and depression in 
people with cardiovascular disease
Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions in 
people with CVD. The global prevalence of depression among people 
with CVD, as measured by various self-report questionnaires, is esti­
mated to be 18%.14 It is more common among women and in older 
ages, yet healthy and physically functioning older adults are at lower 
risk of depression compared with young adults.14,133,134 Depression 
is associated with several negative lifestyle factors, such as smoking, al­
cohol intake, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet, as well as other 
CVD risk factors including diabetes and hypertension.135 These poten­
tially modifiable risk factors are all associated with coronary artery dis­
ease (CAD), MI, HF, stroke, and mortality.54 Table 1 presents examples 
of studies demonstrating how rates of depression vary based on the 
condition, diagnostic methods, and population demographics.
5.2.1.2. Impact of depressive symptoms and depression on 
cardiovascular disease prognosis
Depression is a known risk factor for poor prognosis among people 
with CVD. While one study did not find a significant impact of 
depression on CV or all-cause mortality after MI,156 more recent stud­
ies suggest otherwise. For example, post-MI depression, though attenu­
ated by severity, independently predicts a 22% higher all-cause 
mortality and 13% more CV events per standard deviation increase 
in depression z-score.157 Depression has been associated with an in­
creased risk of non-fatal CV events, as well as all-cause mortality after 
ACS.17 Even 10 years after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
(∼50% elective), depression was associated with an increased risk for 
all-cause mortality.158 Depression is also a marker of poor prognosis 
in people with HF, where both depressive symptoms and depressive 
disorders have been prospectively linked to frequent hospitalizations, 
recurrent CV events, and mortality.18 The prospective associations be­
tween elevated depressive symptoms or a depressive disorder and HF 
was associated with a two-fold increased risk of death or CV events.15
Depression at the start of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ECR) 
was significantly associated with lower improvement in exercise capacity 
and QoL during rehabilitation.129 Depression and previous suicide at­
tempts detected before or after heart transplantation (HTx) may impact 
long-term HTx outcomes (rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and 
death),159 probably related to increased non-adherence to medications.160
Table 1 Prevalence of depression/depressive symptoms in people with cardiovascular disease
CVD
Prevalence data
ACS/Post-MI
Depressive symptoms were reported by 31% of individuals following MI.136
The prevalence of depression at the time of hospitalization was 40% in women under 60 years, compared with 22% in 
men of the same age group. Among those over 60 years, the prevalence was 21% in women and 15% in men.137
In 8580 people with ACS from 22 European countries who were ≥6 months post-hospitalization,a depressive 
symptoms were more frequent in women (32.3%) than men (21.2%), with moderate/severe depression in 12.7% of 
women and 7.4% of men.138
Chronic HF
Clinically significant depression affected 21.5% of people with HF, ranging from 33.6% via questionnaires to 19.3% via 
interviews, and 11% in NYHA class I to 42% in NYHA class IV.15
Depression was more common in women with chronic HF (32.7% vs 26.1%), with rates of 11%–67% in women and 
7%–63% in men, and increased with higher NYHA functional class.15
Advanced HF and 
post-transplantation
Depression affects 25%–35% of individuals after HTx.139–141
Depression was reported in 35% of individuals pre-transplant and 26.3% post-transplant.140
Depression occurs in 15%–39% of people with ventricular assist devices, often exceeding clinical cut-offs, particularly in 
older people.114,142
People experiencing HTx had less depression than those with mechanical assist devices.143
AF
38% of people with AF met Beck Depression Inventory criteria for significant depression.144
ICD
Random-effects meta-analyses showed clinically relevant depression in 15.4% (95% CI 11.9%–18.9%) of people with an 
ICD at all timepoints post-insertion.145
The 2 year incidence of new-onset depression after ICD implantation was 11.3% in a national ICD registry.146
Depressive symptoms affected 20% of people with ICDs (12% mild, 6% moderate, 2% severe). Moderate to severe 
depression was more common in secondary prophylactic indications and in people experiencing ≥5 ICD shocks.147
People with ICDs and pacemakers had similarly increased levels of depression.148
ACHD
Individuals with ACHD have higher depression rates than the general population, with a weighted prevalence of 24% vs 15%.149
People with ACHD had a low and comparable suicide risk to the reference cohort.150
PH/PAH
In 2161 people with PH, the reported pooled prevalence of depression was 28% (95% CI 20.5–36.8).134
Smaller studies report depression prevalence in people with PAH ranging from 9% to 70%, linked to disease 
severity.151–155

Depression is also related to increased adverse events in people with 
ventricular assist devices (VAD),161,162 and is a factor for negative out­
comes among people coping with AF. In a meta-analysis consisting of 
seven cohort studies with 1070 AF people who underwent catheter ab­
lation, depression before the procedure was independently associated 
with an increased risk of AF recurrence after ablation.163 Further, symp­
toms of depression were the strongest independent predictor of future 
QoL post-ablation.144
5.2.1.3. Impact of depressive symptoms/depression on 
self-management and adherence
One possible path by which depression is associated with adverse out­
comes among people with CVD is limited engagement in self-care prac­
tices and lack of adherence, as depression is associated with challenges in 
self-management of CV medication, healthy lifestyle, ECR, and self- 
care.129,164–166 Kronish et al. reported that people with persistent de­
pression were only half as likely to enrol in an ECR programme com­
pared with those without persistent depression.167 People with 
persistent depression also showed lower rates of adherence to smoking 
cessation, taking medications, and exercising. A recent daily diary study 
demonstrated that on days when people attending ECR experienced ele­
vated depression symptoms, they engaged in less physical activity and 
more sedentary behaviour.168 In a cohort study of individuals who under­
went PCI (n = 124 443), participants with depression were 10% to 20% 
less likely to attain optimal adherence to Guideline-recommended med­
ications compared with those without depression.169 Finally, a systematic 
review of quantitative studies indicated that even mild to moderate levels 
of depression were significantly associated with medication adherence in 
people with HF.170
5.2.2. Anxiety
5.2.2.1. Prevalence of anxiety in people with cardiovascular disease
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found prevalence of anx­
iety among people with CVD to range from 28.9% to 32.9%.16,171
Higher rates are found using questionnaires (34.8% to 9%) compared 
with clinical diagnostic interviews (17%). The highest rates of anxiety 
disorder based on diagnostic interviews were reported in people with 
undifferentiated chest pain or palpitations (19%). Anxiety tended to 
be more prevalent among females compared with males (43% vs 
29.5%).171 As with depression, prevalence of anxiety varies by CV 
condition, method of diagnosis, and population demographics. 
Table 2 presents examples of studies demonstrating how rates of anx­
iety vary based on the condition, diagnostic methods, and population 
demographics.
5.2.2.2. Impact of anxiety on cardiovascular disease prognosis
A meta-analysis estimating the effect of anxiety on CV outcomes in 
more than 30 000 people with CAD found that the impact depends 
on the timing, with no effect of anxiety in the first 2 months after 
ACS but with a negative effect on outcome in people with stable 
CAD.19 Generalized anxiety disorder, present in 5.5% of people 3 
months after acute MI (AMI), was associated with a two-fold increased 
risk of adverse outcomes (CV events and all-cause mortality) during a 
10 year follow-up period.184 There is little effect of anxiety symptoms 
alone on outcome in HF although comorbid anxiety and depression 
increase the risk for rehospitalization and mortality in people with 
HF.185–187 Among people with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator 
(ICD), anxiety was a strong predictor of mortality with an OR of 4.17 in 
a cross-sectional national survey in Denmark.188
5.2.2.3. Impact of anxiety on self-management and adherence
Interestingly, anxiety, as opposed to depression, may encourage people 
to be adherent (e.g. to their medication regimen) and can have a posi­
tive impact on clinical outcome in people with CVD.189,190 However, 
anxiety disorders are mostly linked with unhealthy lifestyle, poor adher­
ence to lifestyle modification, and lower participation in ECR.138 One 
possible explanation of this trend is people with anxiety have a ten­
dency to avoid reminders of the illness.191
5.2.3. Cardiac disease-induced post-traumatic stress 
disorder/symptoms
5.2.3.1. Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in 
cardiovascular disease
Cardiac disease-induced PTSD, or post-traumatic stress symptoms 
(PTSS) defined as post-traumatic symptoms to full disorder emerging 
from an acute CV event or intervention, has a heterogeneous incidence 
among different types of CVD. Table 3 presents examples of studies 
demonstrating how rates of PTSD and PTSS vary based on the condi­
tion, diagnostic methods, and population demographics.
5.2.3.2. Impact of post-traumatic stress disorder on cardiovascular 
disease prognosis
Cardiac disease-induced PTSS are linked to numerous adverse physical 
and emotional outcomes, including increased overall psychopathology 
and heightened mortality risk. However, due to the predominantly 
cross-sectional or retrospective nature of existing studies, distinguish­
ing the effects of CDI-PTSS from those of the triggering event remains 
challenging. Nevertheless, the association between CDI-PTSS and ele­
vated rates of mortality and CV events underscores the need for fur­
ther research.13
Studies examining the implications of CDI-PTSS on subsequent 
MACE or all-cause mortality yielded mixed results. The severity of in­
trusion symptoms (intrusive thoughts or images related to the traumat­
ic event, nightmares, and flashbacks) measured 1 month after a first MI 
predicted recurrent MACE/all-cause mortality 42 months later.198
People scoring >11 on the intrusions dimension of the Impact of 
Event Scale (IES)199 had a three times higher risk of developing 
MACE and all-cause mortality than did those classified as low on this 
symptom cluster.198 Similarly, dissociative symptoms during hospitaliza­
tion predict 15 year all-cause mortality among people with MI,200 and 
people with above-threshold PTSD-related symptoms at 6 months 
post-event had a 42%–50% prevalence of experiencing other serious 
CV events during the next 6 months compared with a 26%–32% preva­
lence of the same among people without PTSS.201 Other studies found 
that PTSD measured 4 to 6 weeks post-MI was not predictive of MACE 
9 months later.202
Cardiac disease-induced PTSS predict non-fatal CVD-related hospital 
readmissions 1 to 4 years after a previous index MI.203 Increasing levels of 
CDI-PTSS, measured by the IES and PTSD Symptom Scale,204 are asso­
ciated with CV readmissions.205 Further, people with IES-reported PTSS

are more than twice as likely as those without PTSS to be readmitted 
during the year following their MI.206 However, other studies showed 
that PTSD measured by the Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale may not 
be associated with frequency of CVD-related hospital readmissions.207
5.2.3.3. Impact of post-traumatic stress disorder on 
self-management and adherence to medical recommendations
Evidence on CDI-PTSD and non-adherence is mixed, with some studies 
showing positive associations and others not.201,206,208–210 However, 
stronger evidence links CDI-PTSD to non-adherence to medication 
and physical activity.
5.2.4. Loneliness and living conditions
In a cross-sectional study of hospitalized people with various types of 
CVD, loneliness measured at discharge was associated with significantly 
worse outcomes in men and women.211 Moreover, loneliness pre­
dicted all-cause mortality risk, which was almost three-fold among wo­
men and two-fold among men. Living alone predicted CV event risk in 
men only (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.05–1.85).211 In a prospective randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) in people with stable CHD, living alone was re­
lated to a higher risk of CV death and the primary composite endpoint 
of non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Being married, as compared with 
being widowed, was associated with a lower risk of CV death and 
the primary composite endpoint.212
Table 2 Prevalence of anxiety/anxiety symptoms in people with cardiovascular disease
CVD
Prevalence data
ACS/Post-MI
In an international cohort of people with CABG, PCI, post-MI, and ACS ≥6 months post-hospitalization, anxiety prevalence 
ranged from 12% to 42% in men and 22% to 64% in women, with moderate to severe anxietya in 11% of men and 23% of 
women.138
At 3 months post-MI, 10% reported high anxiety, dropping to reference population levelsb at 3–18 months.172
In people diagnosed with SCAD, 41% had mild anxiety and 16% moderate to severe anxiety by questionnaire. Higher anxiety 
scores were more common in women, younger individuals, those with lower resilience, and those closer to the event.173
Chronic HF
Up to 72% of people with HF experience anxiety, with pooled estimates of 56% for symptoms, 29% for clinically significant 
anxiety, and 13.1% for anxiety disorders. Prevalence was higher in studies with more female participants.174
People with HF face a higher risk of anxiety, with 23% experiencing symptoms and 32% having both anxiety and 
depression.175
Advanced HF and 
post-transplantation
The pooled prevalence of anxiety among people experiencing HTx was 11% (95% CI 3.8%–28.5%).176
AF
People with AF exhibited a 28% prevalence of anxiety at baseline, comparable to controls, with symptoms persisting in 37% 
after 6 months.144
Among people undergoing cardioversion or ablation, 30% reported clinically significant anxiety.177
ICD
Among OHCA survivors, anxiety was reported in 36% of women vs 20% of men, with higher rates in younger women 
(<55 years) than older women (43% vs 28%).178
At 18 months post-OHCA, 32% showed anxiety symptoms.179
A large-scale registry reported 20% anxiety among people experiencing OHCA.180
Random-effects meta-analysis found clinically relevant anxiety in 23% (95% CI 18.3%–27.0%) of people with an ICD at all 
timepoints post-insertion.145
New-onset anxiety incidence was 15% at 24 months post-ICD implantation, with higher rates in women and the secondary 
prevention setting.146,181
People with ICDs and pacemakers exhibited similarly elevated anxiety levels.148
ACHD
A review found anxiety symptoms to be common both immediately after CV events or surgery and during follow-up.182
Anxiety prevalence was higher in people with ACHD (13%) compared with a historical cohort of people with non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma and German reference values (6%).183
PH/PAH
A total of 24 studies with 2161 people with PH reported a pooled prevalence of 37% for anxiety (95% CI 28.7–46.4).134
Smaller studies reported anxiety prevalence in people with PAH ranging from 9% to 58%, linked to disease severity.151–154
Anxiety incidence was higher in people with PAH living in urban areas and in non-smokers or non-drinkers compared with 
their counterparts.154

5.2.5. Chronic stress
Chronic stress, defined as the experience of physical and emotional im­
balance determined by life events and conditions, was found in 58% of 
people with CVD based on a systematic review (five studies, n = 533).16
A large observational study (n = 3572) reported that perceived stress 
was significantly higher in women vs men at baseline and 1 month after 
MI.213 Perceived chronic stress was associated with worse recovery in 
overall QoL and mental status among people with MI.213
Recent studies have focused on the concept of CV distress, defined 
as ‘a persistent negative emotional state rather than a transient state; involv­
ing multiple psychosocial domains; that challenges a person’s capacity to 
cope with living with their heart condition, the treatment of the condition, 
and the resultant changes to daily living; and challenges the person’s sense 
of self and future orientation’.214 This study, using the Cardiac Distress 
Inventory-Short Form (CDI-SF), found significantly higher scores on 
the CDI-SF among younger people and women.214 People with HF 
and elevated stress levels may undergo a more challenging disease tra­
jectory, characterized by a diminished QoL and heightened susceptibil­
ity to adverse events.215 Indeed, people with HF reporting high stress 
levels had a higher likelihood of adverse events during the study 
period.216
5.3. Addressing the mental health needs of 
informal caregivers for people with 
cardiovascular disease
Following the initial diagnosis, people may be asked to implement sub­
stantial lifestyle changes to reduce CV risk, prevent further disease pro­
gression, and enhance QoL.217 Coping with CVD and embracing new 
habits can prove challenging, and for adults, the primary source of sup­
port often comes from their informal caregivers, primarily their part­
ners.218,219 Partners are usually the most available and accessible 
persons for support, physically during hospitalizations and medical vis­
its, at home, and emotionally.220
The caregiving efforts of informal caregivers can exert a significant toll 
on themselves.31,35 Providing emotional and tangible support to a person 
coping with CVD may lead to caregiver emotional and/or physical strain. 
Some studies have identified mental health risks, such as increased levels 
of anxiety, depression, or CDI-PTSD among caregivers in the context of 
CVD.31–33,220 A recent review221 suggested that low to moderate levels 
of distress were common among family caregivers of people with CAD 
(prevalence ranging from 6% to 67% of caregivers). Family caregivers of 
people with HF cope with significantly higher physical and psychological 
health risks compared with non-caregivers.222 In the context of a VAD 
implantation, spouses have been found to have higher anxiety rates com­
pared with the person with the VAD,223 as well as lower mental QoL as a 
consequence of VAD-related disturbances in sexual activity.224
Despite ample literature documenting the adverse effects of caregiv­
ing, the person with CVD is seen as the sole focal point of attention and 
exclusive recipient of care, thus overlooking the needs of the informal 
caregiver.34 A shift in healthcare systems from focusing solely on indivi­
duals to adopting a holistic approach that includes the individual and 
their families, is needed. Family caregivers are essential collaborators, 
as they often ensure people can build change into their lives and adhere 
to their treatment plans. Educating and supporting informal caregivers 
represents not only a mechanism for improving long-term outcomes, 
but also a means of reducing healthcare costs through the avoidance 
of repeat engagements with the health system.225,226 Most importantly, 
caring for informal caregivers not only benefits the person living with 
CVD and reduces medical costs, but also reflects a holistic approach 
to CV practice. By supporting informal caregivers, a compassionate 
and sustainable healthcare system of CVD management is fostered, 
which is essential for the long-term success. Different Psycho-Cardio 
team members engage with informal caregivers at varying levels. 
Every team member should remain mindful of the challenges faced by 
those who care for a person living with CVD. Figure 6 outlines specific 
actions the Psycho-Cardio team members can take to assess and alle­
viate caregiver distress.

management of mental health 
issues in people with cardiovascular 
disease
6.1. Awareness of needs in people with 
cardiovascular disease
Depression and anxiety can easily be overlooked in the routine care of 
people with CVD and/or considered ‘normal’ reactions to the clinical 
and prognostic burden of their disease. Given the high prevalence of 
mental health conditions among people with CVD, and their impact 
on outcomes and adherence, the possibility of evaluating mental health 
status at some point during professional encounters can be considered 
a worthy strategy to improve health. People with CVD with potential 
symptoms of mental health conditions should undergo formal screen­
ing and, at least, a low threshold for formal screening of mental health 
symptoms should be applied in people with CVD.
The recent manuscript ‘How your patient is really feeling: the emotional 
hinterland of a cardiac diagnosis’, written by individuals with CVD, illumi­
nates their experience.30 In this piece, people coping with CVD high­
light challenges faced when diagnosed, gaps in care, and unmet 
needs.30 Priorities, such as the need for an on demand, accessible, tai­
lored, and long-term multidisciplinary support network, are outlined. 
Suggestions for establishing the best possible person-centred support 
system and components for long-term support are outlined in 
Figure 7. Additional experiences of people coping with CVD, presented 
in the associated ‘Clinical cases and patient perspectives’ text, further 
highlight the importance of integrating mental health assessment within 
CVD care.

Figure 6 Suggestions for supporting informal caregivers of people living with cardiovascular disease.  
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
There is a multidirectional association between CVD and mental 
health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD, increasing 
each other’s risk.
(ii)
Mental health conditions in people with CVD, such as depression, can 
negatively affect self-management, including adherence to medication 
and lifestyle changes, and are associated with worse outcomes.
(iii)
The effects of anxiety and PTSD on adherence and CV outcomes are 
less clear and might be time-dependent.
(iv)
Caregivers play an essential role in supporting their family members 
who cope with CVD to incorporate lasting lifestyle changes and to 
adhere to treatment plans: assessing and supporting caregivers 
well-being benefits both parties.
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
It is reasonable to assess depression, anxiety, and PTSD in people 
with established CVD as they are highly prevalent and impact 
outcomes, and refer promptly to a professional when needed.
(ii)
Chronic stress and loneliness are associated with negative outcomes 
in people with CVD and should prompt referral if identified during 
clinical assessment.
(iii)
Incorporating informal caregiver well-being assessment and support 
is advisable in the holistic approach of mental and CV health.

6.2. Identification and screening
Taking a clinical history is an opportunity for the evaluation of potential 
symptoms and any history of mental health conditions. Conversations 
during the clinical course are further opportunities to identify previous­
ly unrecognized symptoms, the appearance of new difficulties, manifes­
tations of mental health conditions, or the need for help. These may 
indicate a requirement for more education relating to their condition(s) 
or support from social care services, which is not unusual in people with 
CVD.227
To ensure that people are being screened and treated for potential 
mental health conditions in addition to their underlying CVD, consider­
ation needs to be given to: (i) who will screen, (ii) when screening 
should be performed, (iii) which screening tools should be used, and 
(iv) how often screening should occur (Figure 8). Given that resources 
may vary across countries, hospitals, and specialized and general prac­
tices, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work. Collaboration with 
mental health professionals (the Psycho-Cardio team) can support de­
veloping a protocol for screening and guiding referrals based on severity

of mental health conditions and local situation. Ideally, screening for 
anxiety and depression should be conducted following a new diagnosis 
of CVD or acute CV event, at least once during follow-up and period­
ically (e.g. annually or when clinically indicated). Brief two-item screen­
ing measures ensure that the time needed for initial screening is limited 
(see Section 5.2.1). 
• When should the screening be done? Following a new diagnosis of CVD 
or acute CV event, periodically, at least once during follow-up, or 
when clinically indicated.
• How should screening be done? Via use of any valid and reliable short 
screening tool, appropriate to the setting and context.
• Who should screen? Any member of the Psycho-Cardio multidisciplin­
ary team who are appropriately qualified to do so.
Of note, screening by itself does not help people with CVD but in­
cludes responsibility to address and provide appropriate referral and 
treatment options. Further, it is important to acknowledge that screen­
ing has been linked to psychological harms (worry and anxiety) that re­
main underexplored in the context of CVD.228 A proposal for the who, 
when, and how of screening for mental health conditions in people with 
CVD is illustrated in Figure 8.
6.2.1. Assessment of depression and anxiety
Two-item screening tools, which only take a few minutes to answer, are 
the simplest way to assess depression and anxiety. We highlight three 
measures, the Whooley questions, the Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ)-2, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-2. Positive 
screens indicate the need for a longer screening measure. The 
Whooley questions are a two-item screening tool for the identification 
of depression that has shown high sensitivity and moderate specifi­
city,229 making this measure a useful initial screening tool for depres­
sion:32,230–233
The Whooley questions229
(i) During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling 
down, depressed, or hopeless?
(ii) During the past month, have you often been bothered by little 
interest or pleasure in doing things?
‘Yes’ to one (or both) questions = positive test (requires further 
evaluation).
‘No’ to both questions = negative test (not depressed).
The two-item and seven-item GAD questionnaires, and the 
two-item and nine-item PHQ tools for depression are widely used 
with good sensitivity and specificity in people with CVD.234–237 The 
GAD and PHQ have been translated into many languages and their 
use does not require a license agreement. Their psychometric proper­
ties are shown in Table 4.
Although it can be a challenging task to choose a screening tool, gen­
eric questionnaires are widely used. It is key to find a screening tool that 
is valid and reliable for people with CVD. The Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS) is widely used, including in people with 
CVD in the inpatient and outpatient setting. However, use of the 
HADS requires a license fee. The joint ESC societies statement on 
patient-reported outcome measures, referred to in Section 5.1.1,239
also notes the Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire, Cardiac Depression 
Scale, and Cardiac Distress Inventory can be considered as possible 
measures.

Mental health conditions can evolve over time and may be episodic. 
Therefore, professionals involved in the long-term management of peo­
ple with CVD need to be aware of their mental well-being, and its 
changes so, ideally, its assessment should be seamlessly integrated 
into routine care (Table 5). Supplementary data online, Tables S4–S6
offer examples of targeted questions that might be helpful to address 
specific aspects of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during clinical 
encounters.
The intensity of symptoms may also change over time. A recent 
study of people without distress at the time of ICD implant found 
that 14.5% developed new-onset anxiety and 11.3% new-onset de­
pression during 24 months of follow-up.146 One cue that might be 
helpful is to monitor scores at the time of first screening (e.g. 
when being implanted with the ICD), as people with a high score 
at that time are more likely to also have an increased score at 
follow-up.240
The value of routine screening is still debated, therefore robust 
mandates have been avoided. The Comparison of Depression 
Interventions After Acute Coronary Syndrome: Quality of Life 
(CODIACS-QoL) RCT is one of few studies where screening for 
depression within 2–12 months post-ACS with or without providing 
depression treatment, did not alter quality-adjusted life years, 
depression-free days, or led to harm.235 Nonetheless, European and 
American Guidelines recommend assessment and screening for de­
pression and anxiety (usually during hospitalization), although do 
not specify how often.132,241–244 Therefore, the optimal timing of 
screening within different CV conditions is not established. This 
Task Force considers it prudent to screen people after a new diagno­
sis of CVD or a CV event, then periodically (e.g. annually and at least 
once during follow-up), and when clinical judgement indicates that it is 
needed (Table 5). Screening can be conducted during hospitalization if 
time permits.
6.2.2. Suggested approach to screening people with 
cardiovascular disease for psychological distress, 
depression, and anxiety
There are two ways in which people can be assessed: (i) by means of a 
clinical diagnostic interview, or (ii) screening by a questionnaire that can 
identify symptom levels but not deliver a diagnosis.
In clinical practice the diagnostic interview may be lengthy, requires 
specific expertise, and thus is likely untenable to perform as a routine 
practice in most clinical settings. However, given that elevated scores 
on a screening questionnaire as well as a diagnosis of depression or anx­
iety increases the risk of morbidity, mortality, and poor QoL, question­
naires are a reasonable starting point. High scores on a screening 
instrument should lead to referral to a mental health professional for 
assessment and/or diagnosis. Questionnaires also provide the means 
for monitoring changes in symptoms over time. As noted previously, 
there are several options with respect to questionnaires to choose 
from and it is important to know the reliability, validity, and appropriate 
usage of the instruments.
6.2.3. Challenges in specific cardiovascular conditions
In people with HF, depression and anxiety can easily be overlooked in 
routine care due to overlapping symptoms, such as fatigue, apathy, lack 
of energy, and sleep disorders. Thus, there is a risk that both people 
with HF and healthcare professionals may misinterpret the situation. 
Depression and anxiety can also be considered ‘normal’ reactions to 
the clinical and prognostic burden of HF. Although routine screening 
for mental health conditions using validated questionnaires and tools is 
advised during hospitalization and follow-up,29,241 it is still not clear 
when and where to screen people with HF. The diagnosis of mental 
health conditions can also be affected by the continuous fluctuations of 
HF symptoms that can interfere with mood and psychology.241,245,246

Psychosocial assessment is an essential component of the evaluation 
of candidates for VAD, mainly aimed at identifying targets for treatment 
and improvement before the procedure, but also identifying potential 
contraindication in some candidates (e.g. uncontrolled psychiatric con­
ditions, consistent non-adherence, active substance abuse). A consen­
sus document on psychosocial assessment in advanced HF,247
endorsed by multiple societies, defined the main domains to evaluate as: 
• Risk factors for poor post-HTx or VAD outcomes.
• Capacity to engage in decision-making.
• Personal and environmental resources.
• Capacity to operate VAD.
Two scores have been used for psychosocial assessment in HTx: 
the Psychosocial Assessment of Candidates for Transplantation 
(PACT) and the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for 
Transplantation (SIPAT). Both have shown good predictive capacity to 
identify people at risk of post-HTx non-adherence and psychosocial 
complications,248,249 although their impact on clinical outcomes is un­
clear. These tools have not been validated in the VAD population.
Quality of life and mental health assessment are needed in people 
with pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to the high reported preva­
lence of depression and anxiety (see Section 5, Tables 1 and 2), but there 
is lack of evidence on the ideal timing or specific method. The HADS 
may be a useful tool, since it was able to rule out anxiety and depression 
disorder with a negative predictive value of 90% in a PH population.250
6.2.4. Assessment of subjective well-being and quality 
of life
The WHO-5 questionnaire, available in 30 languages,251,252 can be used 
to assess SWB and does not require a license fee. A percentage score 
<50 (or a raw score <13) has been suggested as a cut-off for poor men­
tal well-being and as an indication for further assessment for the pos­
sible presence of a mental health condition (e.g. depressive disorder).
Patient-reported measures such as QoL are seen as essential in clin­
ical practice as well as in clinical trials as ways to assess symptoms, func­
tion, well-being, perspectives, and undisclosed problems. Several 
disease-specific QoL instruments are available, valid in specific condi­
tions such as HF, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), AF, congenital heart 
disease, and PH. Generic measures such as the Short-Form 12 or 36 
or EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire are often used as 
well. Most QoL instruments include items related to mental health sta­
tus as well as physical health, which can alert a healthcare professional 
to a need for screening for mental health conditions. These instruments 
are being incorporated into electronic medical records in some sys­
tems, but implementation of regular QoL assessment is hindered by 
limited integration into clinical practice and interpretation of scores. 
However, electronic medical records and automated systems should 
in future simplify assessment of well-being, QoL, and mental health con­
ditions at regular intervals. A full list of these measures can be found in a 
recent ESC statement on ‘Placing patient-reported outcomes at the 
centre of CV clinical practice’.239
6.3. Management of mental health 
conditions in people with cardiovascular 
disease
Given the negative impact of poorer mental health on adherence to 
medication and lifestyle, QoL, prognosis, and costs, people with an in­
creased symptom score on anxiety and/or depression questionnaires 
and those with a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, depression, or PTSD, 
should be considered potential candidates for receiving treatment. 
Although evidence is sparse that people with CVD screened for anxiety 
and depression and treated afterwards have a better prognosis,235 there 
are a few promising studies. A retrospective cohort study of people 
with depression who received psychotherapies via primary care services 
(n  = 636 955), reported that intervention-driven improvements in 
depression symptoms were associated with a lower risk of any-cause 
new-onset CVD (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.86–0.89). Subanalyses suggested 
the association was greater in those <60 years of age.253 In recognition 
of the different levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD experi­
enced, and therefore the different needs with respect to treatment, a 
stepped care approach (Figure 9) would be one way forward.254–257
Stepped care takes into account people’s preferences and can be adapted 
to symptom severity and resources available, and does not mean that all 
earlier steps need to be done before accessing higher level support.
6.3.1. Communication, education, and support for 
people with mental health conditions and 
cardiovascular disease
Effective communication is a cornerstone of healthcare delivery, foster­
ing person-centred care, and addressing the complex interplay between 
mental and physical health.258 Proportional stress, anxiety, or fear may 
be normal reactions after a diagnosis of CVD, acute CV events, CV pro­
cedures or interventions, or their complications. Empathy and active lis­
tening are essential to understanding the potential difficulties and 
worries the person with CVD and their family members may face. It 
is important to recognize that challenges may not only be due to the 
physical consequences of CVD or its therapy. Rather, healthcare pro­
fessionals must appreciate the full spectrum of mental and emotional 
consequences, as well as the impacts this may have on lifestyle, profes­
sional, family, social, or economic factors as presented in the associated 
‘Clinical cases and patient perspectives’ document. Healthcare profes­
sionals should ensure that people receive support for both physical and 
mental health needs, preventing or attenuating unwanted psychological 
or emotional reactions, and potentially improving therapeutic adher­
ence and clinical outcomes.259
Open dialogue with people with CVD, family, and caregivers, 
adapted to their age, cultural level, beliefs, and preferences, is essen­
tial.260 Answering questions, solving doubts and clarifying uncertainties 
is a key aspect of therapeutic relationships and may help prevent mis­
understandings and irrational fears.261 While in ECR programmes there 
is more time and opportunity for communication, this may be challen­
ging to deliver in acute or critical care and in outpatient care, where 
time pressure is constant. In these settings, time for high-quality com­
munication should be facilitated.
Multiple individual, professional, condition-specific, and organization­
al factors including health literacy, mental health issues, and time pres­
sures, impact the quality of communication. The impact of mental 
health on communication may be particularly strong in people with 
SMI. Shared decision-making (SDM), in which the person coping with 
CVD and professionals discuss evidence and options for treatment, 
and people are supported to make informed decisions, is dependent 
on good communication. A systematic review and meta-analysis of in­
terventions to increase SDM in CVD found that the interventions re­
duced decisional conflict and increased knowledge across a wide 
range of CVD conditions and formats.262
Compassion in CVD care is an important element in communication 
and understanding. More information on compassionate care can be 
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               23

found in supplementary data online, and Table S7. Caregivers and family 
involvement can improve mental well-being and CV outcomes; a para­
digm shift in the organization of care may be needed to include the per­
son’s social environment into treatment. More information can be 
found in the supplementary data online.
6.3.2. Psychological interventions
A broad range of strategies, from cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), 
psycho-education, and mindfulness-based techniques to lifestyle modi­
fication programmes and support groups, including internet-based in­
terventions and mobile health (mHealth) solutions, have been 
proposed as psychological therapeutic options for people with CVD.263
6.3.3. Psycho-education
Psycho-education is an intervention with structured knowledge trans­
fer about an illness and its treatment, integrating emotional and motiv­
ational aspects to enable people to cope with the illness and to improve 
its treatment adherence and effectiveness.264 It is considered an im­
portant component of treatment in both medical and mental health 
conditions.265 A psycho-educational approach is already embedded 
within multiple CV care settings, including ECR and secondary preven­
tion programmes. It includes education on the underlying disease and 
current risk factors and suggestions for lifestyle modifications. Based 
on the results of a recent synthesis of RCTs (n = 8748 people 
post-MI or revascularization), a psycho-educational approach should in­
tegrate several modes of delivery and preferably last for at least 3 
months.266 The effects of psycho-educational interventions on depres­
sion and anxiety symptoms when combined in meta-analysis are large 
based on accepted thresholds.267
For people with arrhythmias and/or ICD for primary or secondary 
prevention, there are physical symptoms, such as sleep disturbance, fa­
tigue, and also psychological fears (fear of shocks, worry about the fu­
ture, and fear of ICD dysfunction) affecting QoL. Psycho-education 
improved the physical component summary of QoL but had no effect 
on mental component summary scores.268 In people with AF,

reductions in serious adverse events [risk ratio (RR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.63– 
0.97], anxiety, depression, and health-related QoL (HRQoL) were ob­
served with psycho-education, although the incidence of AF episodes 
was not affected.269
6.3.4. Social prescribing
Social prescribing is a transformative healthcare approach that connects 
people with non-medical resources to enhance their holistic well-being. 
The core idea behind social prescribing is to provide people with per­
sonalized interventions that extend beyond traditional medical pre­
scriptions, encompassing a spectrum of community-based activities 
and resources.270,271 The aim is to address diverse aspects of mental 
health, such as social isolation, loneliness, stress, and anxiety, by facilitat­
ing access to supportive community activities. Social prescribing le­
verages a variety of activities, ranging from arts workshops, music 
therapy, and group dance sessions to support networks, to enhance 
mental well-being and cultivate a sense of belonging and purpose.
Engagement in community activities, such as group dance, hiking, 
and cooking classes, combats feelings of isolation and fosters meaningful 
social interactions, thereby bolstering mental well-being.272,273
These community connections act as protective factors against stress 
and isolation, potentially enhancing mental health support for people 
with CVD. This can lead to reductions in depressive symptoms, im­
provements in QoL, and better adherence to CV treatment plans.270
A systematic review of 17 studies involving 13 social prescribing inter­
ventions with a total of 5036 participants found statistically significant 
improvements in mental health, general well-being, and QoL in 16 
of the studies.274 Despite these promising findings, more research fo­
cusing specifically on people with CVD is necessary to draw reliable 
conclusions.
Interventions involving social professionals were found to be more 
effective for reducing anxiety and depression, while those involving 
health professionals had a greater impact on improving blood pressure 
and encouraging physical activity.275 Participating in arts, including visual 
art therapy and music therapy, has shown positive effects on mood and 
emotional regulation.276 Music, in particular, can be a powerful tool in 
reducing stress and enhancing mood in people with CVD. Activities 
such as gardening, green exercise, and nature walks have been effective 
in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure and have demonstrated 
moderate to large effects on depression and anxiety scores.275,277
These interventions also increase daily step counts, though the overall 
impact on physical activity time is still being evaluated.
Technology plays a pivotal role in facilitating social prescribing. 
Mobile apps and online platforms can recommend suitable social pre­
scriptions based on personal profiles and mental health assessments, 
serving as valuable resources for people to explore options, engage 
in virtual support groups, and track their progress.278 Real-time data 
collection through these platforms allows healthcare professionals to 
monitor engagement and outcomes more effectively.279 Integrating so­
cial prescribing into standard care pathways, fostering community part­
nerships, and leveraging technology ensures efficient and personalized 
recommendations. This approach aligns with modern healthcare para­
digms, emphasizing holistic well-being and personalized interventions, 
particularly for people with CVD dealing with mental health concerns, 
although more research is needed.280 There is growing evidence sup­
porting the use of social prescribing in the management of CVD. 
Healthcare professionals should be aware of local social prescribing in­
terventions and availability in their environment and refer when 
appropriate.
6.3.5. Other psychological interventions
A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of psycho­
logical interventions for CHD including relaxation, cognitive techni­
ques, emotional support and/or client-led discussion, and adjunct 
pharmacology, reported a reduction in CV mortality (from 7.3% to 
5.5%) with psychological interventions compared with usual care con­
trols.281 No between-group differences were observed for the rates 
of total mortality, non-fatal MI, or revascularization procedures. 
Psychological interventions were found to achieve small to moderate 
improvements in depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress compared 
with controls, although there remains some uncertainty in these 
estimates.281
Cognitive-behavioural therapy is a psychological intervention that fo­
cuses on changing patterns of unhelpful thinking and behaviour.282 Two 
recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of 
CBT-based interventions in RCTs in people with CAD showed that 
CBT-based interventions can reduce CV events, MI, and angina dur­
ation and intensity at the end of follow-up. Findings varied by trials, 
with no effect on other clinical outcomes,283 but improving significantly 
psychological outcomes, such as depressive symptoms, anxiety, depres­
sion, stress, and increasing vital satisfaction at the end of follow-up.284
A recent study assessing the effect of CBT has shown efficacy in im­
proving AF-specific QoL for people with symptomatic paroxysmal AF. 
AF-CBT led to large improvements, reducing healthcare-related con­
sumption by 56%, although the AF burden remained unchanged.285 A 
further RCT testing a CBT intervention in young people with CAD 
showed improvement in the total HADS score after 3 months, with dif­
ferences maintained after 6 months. The intervention group also had 
greater adherence to ECR and more improvement in HRQoL at 6 
months. A significant reduction in CVD-related admissions at 12 
months was also observed.286
Recently, a multicentre study in which 250 people with AMI were 
randomized after PCI to either control or cognitive-behavioural stress 
management detected that the latter improves anxiety, depression, 
and QoL but does not affect MACE.287 However, another trial of 
362 people who had experienced a CVD event randomized to usual 
care or usual care plus CBT, found that CBT decreased the risk of re­
current events including MI.288 Cognitive-based or external support 
coping mechanisms seem to attenuate the mental impact of PH, de­
creasing anxiety or depression rates.289 This suggests a potential 
benefit for early identification and psychological intervention. In 
fact, psychosocial support has a Class I recommendation in the cur­
rent ESC/European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines for the diag­
nosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension,290 and is endorsed in 
the 2024 ESC Guidelines for the management of chronic coronary 
syndromes.242
Cognitive-behavioural therapy is safe and has shown to have benefi­
cial effects in improving mental symptoms, in particular depression, and 
QoL in people with CVD and HF, and it could be a valid option due to 
the lack of potential side effects or drug interactions. However, a small 
qualitative study found that some people reported side effects, includ­
ing discomfort with treatment and worsening of symptoms.287,289,291
Exposure therapy can be helpful for people with CVD, who due to 
their disease stop doing the things that they used to enjoy due to fear of 
another CV event, which may lead to depression. An example is a per­
son who experiences an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) while 
cycling. Often this will cause anxiety and fear of taking up cycling again, 
as cycling is associated with OHCA. However, exposure therapy, 
where the therapist exposes the person gradually and in a safe way 
to situations and activities that they fear, is often helpful.292
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               25

Similarly, behavioural activation uses behaviours to influence emo­
tional state as engaging in activities that increase social connections 
and feelings of well-being can decrease depression. A pragmatic RCT 
in 416 people with HF and comorbid depression compared the effect­
iveness of antidepressant medication vs behavioural activation psycho­
therapy. Both groups experienced equal benefits with close to a 50% 
reduction in depressive symptoms at 3, 6, and 12 months.293 People re­
ceiving behavioural activation psychotherapy had significantly better 
physical HRQoL and HF-specific HRQoL. Although there is limited evi­
dence within CVD, some people have reported that philosophical 
counselling (Supplementary data online, Table S8) can be a complemen­
tary approach to other therapeutic strategies.
6.3.6. Interventions for people with post-traumatic 
stress disorder
Limited evidence on the prevention and management of CDI-PTSD is 
available. A comparison of eye movement desensitization and repro­
cessing (EMDR) with imaginal exposure in 42 people with PTSD in­
duced by life-threatening CV events, including surgery, MI, and 
cardiac arrest, showed EMDR significantly reduced CDI-PTSD symp­
toms at 4 weeks and 6 months.294 Fifty-one people with PTSD symp­
toms due to a CV event randomized to imaginal exposure or control 
group reported improved PTSD symptoms compared with the control 
group, although this difference was not statistically significant due to the 
small sample size. This initial study in the field of exposure psychothera­
pies provides promising evidence for the safety of using this technique 
in people with CVD.295
In a more recent RCT designed to determine if trauma-focused 
counselling within 48 h of hospital admission could prevent the devel­
opment of PTSS, 190 people with ACS experiencing distress were as­
signed to either trauma-focused counselling (one session) or a general 
stress management active control group. Results showed fewer bene­
ficial effects for the trauma-focused counselling group compared with 
the control group.296
6.3.7. Lifestyle interventions
Adopting a holistic approach that includes lifestyle changes can effect­
ively improve mental health, CV well-being, risk factors, and CV out­
comes.297–302 Examples of lifestyle changes include regular physical 
activity, a balanced diet, stress management techniques (such as mind­
fulness and yoga), adequate sleep, and positive coping strategies.303,304
6.3.8. Physical activity and exercise in people with 
cardiovascular disease and mental health conditions
Physical activity encompasses a wide range of bodily movements that 
increase energy expenditure, including everyday tasks such as walking, 
household chores, and active commuting. Exercise is a more structured 
and purposeful form of physical activity designed to enhance or main­
tain physical fitness. The benefits of exercise in people with CVD ex­
tend beyond improving physical health; it also significantly enhances 
psychological well-being, including reassurance in those who are con­
cerned for potential recurrences of their event or worsening of their 
disease. Exercise induces the release of endorphins and other neuroac­
tive substances, contributing to mood improvement and stress reduc­
tion.305 These effects are particularly beneficial for people with CVD, 
who often face psychological challenges in addition to their physical 
health issues.306 In people with CAD and depression, exercise has 
been shown to be an effective component of treatment. A network 
meta-analysis (33 RCTs, n = 7240) demonstrated that exercise, when 
combined with antidepressants and psychotherapy, significantly re­
duced depressive symptoms at 8 weeks. The study suggested that while 
antidepressants remained effective at 26 weeks, the addition of exercise 
could enhance overall treatment efficacy.307
For people with HF, the Heart Failure-A Controlled Trial 
Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) demon­
strated that exercise training led to a modest but significant decline in 
depression symptoms at both 3 and 12 months, as evidenced by im­
provements in the Beck Depression Inventory score in the exercise 
group. The study emphasized that while exercise is beneficial, the 
type and duration should be tailored to functional capacity, with consid­
erations for independent or supervised exercise programmes.308,309
In summary, exercise is a critical component of managing CVD in 
adults, particularly for those with HF and CAD. Its benefits include im­
provements in both physical and mental health, which are crucial for en­
hancing the overall QoL in people with CVD.
6.3.9. Diet and nutrition approaches in cardiovascular 
disease and mental health conditions
Dietary interventions and nutritional strategies hold promise for im­
proving both CVD310 and mental health outcomes in individuals with 
CVD. However, the current evidence specifically addressing mental 
health improvements through dietary changes in this population is lim­
ited, highlighting the need for more robust and targeted research to es­
tablish clear recommendations.
Several dietary patterns have been explored for their potential men­
tal health benefits in people with CVD. The Mediterranean diet, rich in 
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, has been associated 
with lower rates of depression and cognitive decline in the general 
population, but data specific to people with CVD are still emer­
ging.311,312 Some studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties 
of this diet could be beneficial, yet conclusive evidence in CVD popula­
tions is lacking.313,314
Fasting interventions, including intermittent fasting and calorie re­
striction, have also been examined for potential to improve mental 
health. While some studies report encouraging results, such as im­
provements in mood and cognitive function, these findings are prelim­
inary. The evidence is not yet strong enough to endorse one fasting 
method over another, particularly for individuals with psychiatric 
conditions.314,315
The Omega-3 Supplementation for Co-Morbid Depression and 
Heart Failure Treatment (OCEAN) trial reported that supplementa­
tion with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in people 
with HF (n = 108) led to positive changes in cognitive depressive symp­
toms and social functioning. However, the small sample size and the use 
of soft endpoints suggest that these findings should be interpreted with 
caution, and larger, more definitive trials are needed.316
While dietary approaches and nutritional interventions are appealing 
for their potential dual benefits on CV and mental health in people with 
CVD, current evidence is insufficient to advise on diet interventions. 
More rigorous studies are needed to determine the most effective diet­
ary strategies for improving mental health outcomes in this population.
6.3.10. Smoking cessation
Tobacco cessation offers significant CV health benefits, particularly for 
individuals with mental health conditions, including those with SMI. 
However, addressing tobacco use in this population is challenging due 
to the complex interplay between addiction and mental health issues. 
Sustained tobacco abstinence over 52 weeks can significantly reduce


<!-- PAGE 27 -->

### Page 27

the 10 year CV risk in people with SMI.317 Despite these CV benefits, 
individuals often face significant challenges post-cessation, such as not­
able weight gain, which can contribute to high rates of obesity, diabetes, 
and hypertension.318 The addictive nature of tobacco use, especially in 
individuals with mental health conditions, necessitates treating tobacco 
use as an addiction and addressing it with comprehensive strategies.
Addressing tobacco cessation in individuals with mental health con­
ditions requires a tailored approach. The Five A’s model (Ask, Advise, 
Assess, Assist, Arrange) is a structured method commonly used to en­
courage and support tobacco cessation. However, it should be adapted 
to meet the unique needs of those with mental health conditions. For 
instance, healthcare professionals should be particularly attentive when 
assessing a person’s readiness to quit, considering his or her mental 
health status, and providing additional support and resources that ad­
dress both their tobacco use and mental health needs.
Cognitive therapies, when combined with medication, have been 
shown to improve tobacco abstinence rates in adults, including those 
with mental health conditions. A review of 21 RCTs found that cogni­
tive therapies combined with medication or nicotine replacement ther­
apy are more effective than medication alone, although the quality of 
evidence varied.319 While tobacco cessation is crucial for improving 
CV and overall health in people with mental health conditions, it re­
quires a nuanced and supportive approach that considers the complex­
ities of addiction in this population.
6.3.11. Stress management techniques
Mindfulness,320 meditation,321 and progressive muscle relaxation322–324
are stress management techniques that have shown promise in foster­
ing cognitive resilience, emotional regulation, and relaxation. However, 
their specific effects on people with CVD need careful consideration 
and evidence-based discussion.325–327
Mindfulness involves focused attention on the present moment, 
fostering cognitive resilience against stressors and aiding emotional regu­
lation.320 A study of mindfulness on people with CVD showed improve­
ments in psychological well-being and CV markers.325 Mindfulness-based 
interventions for adults aged 19 to 40 years in developed countries, in­
cluding mindfulness-based stress reduction programmes, mindfulness- 
based cognitive therapy programmes, and the Learning 2 BREATHE 
(Body, Reflections/thoughts, Emotions, Attention, Tenderness, Habits, 
Empowerment) programme, generally improve well-being and can be ef­
fectively implemented in a virtual format.325
Meditation focuses on controlled breathing or visualization, trigger­
ing the parasympathetic nervous system to induce relaxation and re­
duce stress hormones.321 A meta-analysis indicated that distress 
management, when combined with ECR, offers limited additional ef­
fects, suggesting that meditation should be integrated cautiously with 
existing ECR programmes.328 A further study showed that meditation 
can reduce stress and improve CV health outcomes in people with 
CVD.326 Meditation and mindfulness, especially evidence-based forms 
like mindfulness-based stress reduction, can support people with 
CVD and their caregivers to reduce anxiety, depression, and pain. 
These practices have shown structural and functional brain changes, 
translate well across different populations, and offer a low-cost, bene­
ficial method to complement treatment during this crisis.326
Progressive muscle relaxation involves sequentially tensing and re­
leasing muscle groups to promote physical and mental relaxation, coun­
tering stress-induced physiological manifestations such as elevated 
heart rate, increased blood pressure, and muscle tension.322–324
A study demonstrated that progressive muscle relaxation could reduce 
anxiety and improve heart rate variability in individuals with CVD.327
6.3.12. Sleep hygiene
Sleep quality is integral to both CV health and mental well-being, particu­
larly in individuals with CVD. Poor sleep quality and insufficient sleep dur­
ation are linked to various adverse CV outcomes, including mortality,329
atherosclerosis,330 hypertension, impaired glucose metabolism, and in­
creased inflammatory markers, and associated with an elevated risk of 
mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, which can fur­
ther complicate the management of CVD.331–333 It is important for 
healthcare professionals to routinely inquire about sleep quality during 
clinical evaluations, given the significant impact of sleep on both CV 
and mental health. Interventions that improve sleep quality such as sleep 
hygiene measures and CBT for insomnia have been shown to improve 
mental health conditions.331 Healthcare professionals should encourage 
people to adopt specific sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a 
consistent sleep schedule, avoiding stimulants like caffeine or nicotine 
close to bedtime, limiting screen exposure in the evening, and creating 
a restful sleep environment with minimal noise and light.331 While wear­
ables like smartwatches offer insights into sleep patterns, their diagnostic 
accuracy remains limited, and they should be complemented by validated 
clinical assessments and evidence-based interventions.
6.4. Tools and resources to support 
lifestyle change
6.4.1. Digital health tools
Among the many new mobile apps released every day for monitoring 
personal health data, only a minority have been scientifically validated 
on healthcare behavioural and clinical outcomes in the CV field. A sys­
tematic review encompassing 39 studies of wearable devices in multiple 
CVDs found potential benefits mainly in lifestyle aspects like physical ac­
tivity and smoking cessation. However, the same review highlighted 
safety, reliability, and regulation concerns.334 A systematic review and 
meta-analysis of mobile phone and mHealth interventions in people 
who had experienced a coronary event (20 studies, n = 4535) reported 
benefits in exercise capacity, physical activity, reductions in all-cause and 
CV readmissions, and improved physical and mental QoL.335 A 
meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of a digital health intervention in peo­
ple with CVD showed that telemonitoring reduced depression in people 
with HF and CAD, and device-based psychological education and training 
had a significant positive effect in reducing depression in people with 
CAD or ICD. Although the use of information and communication tech­
nologies for health (eHealth) in daily practice is promising, there are still 
several barriers, including reimbursement challenges, digital literacy is­
sues, and unequal access to digital technology (digital divide) in low- 
income countries or in remote areas as well as in the elderly.336
6.4.2. Motivational interviewing
Motivational interviewing (MotInt) is a person-centred counselling style 
for addressing the common problem of ambivalence about healthy life­
style changes. It can be an effective counselling approach that bolsters 
motivation by resolving ambivalence. Motivational interviewing has 
shown efficacy in helping to make healthy behavioural changes and con­
trol CV risk factors with some evidence that shows an effect on the 
management of depression.337 More information about MotInt can 
be found in the supplementary data online.

6.4.3. Cardiac rehabilitation
Cardiac rehabilitation is a comprehensive multicomponent programme 
of secondary prevention aiming to reduce CVD risk and optimize 
health and well-being. A key component of most cardiac rehabilitation 
programmes is structured exercise (ECR) along with other compo­
nents such as assessment, education, psychosocial support, informa­
tion, behavioural interventions, and risk factor management.338,339
Meta-analyses have shown that ECR is effective in improving mortality, 
morbidity, and HRQoL outcomes across multiple CV conditions,340–344
but few meta-analyses provide evidence of improvement in measures 
of mental health.343–345 These have found only weak evidence and small 
effects of ECR on depression and anxiety symptoms in people with 
CVD, even when psychological interventions were added.328,344–346
These results may be surprising given that psychosocial management 
is one of the core components of comprehensive ECR,347 and exercise 
has been shown to have beneficial effects on the risk for and symptoms 
of depression and anxiety. Possible explanations include lack of sys­
tematic measurement of mental health outcomes, lack of recruitment 
of people with mental health conditions, and reluctance of people with 
mental health conditions to attend ECR or participate in studies. 
Screening for depression and anxiety in ECR is advocated,348 but has 
been found to be inconsistently implemented with variation across 
conditions and services.349 A position statement from the European 
Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC)348 advises screening 
for mental health conditions and referral to a psychologist or psych­
iatrist when needed.
Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation has the potential to benefit 
people with mild to moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, 
and stress, but studies and evaluation are essential. One recent 
RCT trained ECR staff to deliver metacognitive therapy to people with 
CVD (n = 332) and demonstrated significant small to moderate improve­
ment in depression and anxiety scores compared with ECR alone.350
Suggestions for ensuring mental health benefit from ECR include: 
• Screening for mental health conditions by ECR staff at the start and 
end of programme.
• Improving the implementation of screening through Guidelines com­
bined with local/national initiatives to support screening.351
• Determining optimal interventions in ECR to improve symptoms of 
mental health conditions, including who should deliver these.
• Collaborating with mental health experts to ensure psychosocial 
support in ECR is robust and that referrals can be made when 
appropriate.
• Evaluating mental health symptoms as an outcome in ECR. The EAPC 
advocates a goal of improvement of depression and anxiety symptom 
scores by 10% on valid measures.348
6.5. Medical interventions
Medical interventions including pharmacotherapy may be needed for 
people with CVD with diagnosed mental health conditions and for peo­
ple with severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD. Careful as­
sessment of the risks and benefits and open dialogue as recommended 
in Section 6.3 will facilitate decision-making.
6.5.1. Efficacy and safety of pharmacological 
treatment for mental health conditions in people 
with cardiovascular disease
Studies evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for 
mental health conditions in CV populations have shown inconsistent 
results. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs of anti­
depressant treatment following ACS found no general improvement 
in all-cause mortality and recurrent MI while the risk of repeat hospital­
ization was significantly reduced. However, in people with a concomi­
tant diagnosis of depression, antidepressants decreased the odds of 
recurrent MI.352 A Cochrane review examining trials on psychological 
treatments and antidepressant drugs in adults with CAD and comorbid 
depression concluded that pharmacological interventions may have a 
large effect on end-of-treatment depression symptoms, while effects 
on mortality or CV endpoints were deemed uncertain.353
Studies on the safety of antidepressant medication in HF have yielded 
conflicting results. One meta-analysis indicated that the use of antide­
pressants in people with HF is associated with an increased risk of all- 
cause death regardless of whether they have clinical depression or the 
type of antidepressants used.354 In contrast, a recent meta-analysis re­
viewing studies of people with depression and known HF in both out­
patient and hospital settings indicated that selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) seem to be a safe treatment option.355 This analysis, 
however, was limited by the variety of study designs and mixed results 
for different antidepressants.
Given the inconsistency of findings across studies on the effective­
ness of pharmacological treatment for mental health conditions in peo­
ple with CVD, there is a clear need for larger and robust RCTs. 
Concerns about drug safety, CV side effects, and interactions between 
psychiatric medications and CVD treatments complicate this manage­
ment and need to be clarified in future research.
6.5.2. Use of specific medications in people with 
depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress 
disorders and cardiovascular disease
In the treatment of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, antidepressants are 
the first-line pharmacological treatment, while additional medications 
including anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics, may be used in the short 
term. Other drugs, such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, may 
also be used, depending on the severity of symptoms. A brief descrip­
tion of the most common medications used for the treatment of mental 
health conditions is given in Supplementary data online, Table S9. 
Figure 10 provides an algorithm for the pharmacological treatment of 
depression, anxiety, and PTSD in CVD.
6.5.3. Use of antidepressants
• The use of antidepressants in CVD populations requires careful se­
lection of medications, dosage adjustments, and close monitoring 
due to potential side effects and clinically relevant drug interactions. 
In general, newer antidepressants are considered safe and asso­
ciated with few serious long-term side effects in people with 
CVD.356–358 However, CVD side effects may occur and are typically 
exerted through noradrenergic activation resulting from the use of 
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), nor­
epinephrine reuptake inhibitors, noradrenergic and specific seroto­
nergic antidepressants, that can cause orthostatic hypotension or 
hypertension.359
• Weight gain (e.g. through mirtazapine use) may worsen CV risk.
• QTc prolongation can increase the risk of polymorphic ventricular 
arrhythmias, which has been associated with some tricyclic antide­
pressants (TCAs), SSRIs, and other antidepressants and bupropion, 
although the evidence is inconsistent.360 A large population study 
did not find an increased risk of arrhythmias for citalopram.361 A net­
work meta-analysis demonstrated a low risk of ventricular

arrhythmia and SCD among people using antidepressants like SNRIs, 
SSRIs, and especially TCAs.362 Some antidepressants (mirtazapine, 
venlafaxine, trazodone) were not found to prolong the QTc interval 
in healthy volunteers.363–365
• Reduction of heart rate variability has been associated with TCA 
use.366,367
• Temporary increase in blood pressure immediately after administra­
tion has been described with esketamine, which is indicated for 
treatment-resistant depression, however, it is not associated with 
long-term development of hypertension.368
Importantly, several pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interac­
tions between antidepressants and CV drugs may affect the efficacy 
and safety of treatment. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring, de­
fined as the measurement and interpretation of drug concentrations 
in blood to optimize pharmacotherapy, is proposed in special clinical 
scenarios. It is particularly useful in cases of non-response at thera­
peutic doses, uncertain drug adherence, suboptimal tolerability, or 
pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions. In people with mental health 
disorders, therapeutic drug monitoring has additional applications 
ranging from strongly recommended to potentially useful including 
use in children and adolescents, pregnant women, elderly people, in­
dividuals with intellectual disabilities, people with substance abuse dis­
orders, forensic psychiatric conditions, or people with known or 
suspected pharmacokinetic abnormalities.369
Many antidepressants and CV drugs are metabolized by cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzymes leading to potential interactions, which are dose 
dependent and can be exaggerated by smoking (Supplementary data 
online, Table S10). Smoking is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 enzymes 
with maximal increase by 10 or more cigarettes per day and decrease 
of CYP1A2 activity within 3 days after smoking cessation.370,371
Potential risks for interactions between antidepressants and CV drugs 
include beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. For example, SSRIs 
inhibit the enzyme activity phase of the CYP pathway by blocking the 
active site of certain CYP isoenzymes, thereby reducing the metabolism 
of other drugs. This may lead, for example, to increased plasma levels of 
metoprolol with a risk of bradycardia or hypotension. Furthermore, 
amiodarone inhibits CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, leading to po­
tential interactions with both SSRIs and TCAs, requiring careful moni­
toring for side effects.369
Notably, SSRIs and SNRIs can increase bleeding risk.372 However, 
there is little evidence that SSRIs increase the risk of clinically relevant 
bleedings or mortality.373 Further, SSRI interactions via the CYP isoen­
zyme system can potentially increase the effects of warfarin and thus, 
the risk of major bleeding requiring close monitoring and management 
of risk factors for bleeding in people treated with both SSRI and vitamin 
K antagonists like warfarin.374 Although studies suggest that direct oral 
anticoagulants have lower potential for pharmacokinetic interactions 
with SSRIs, caution is also required with concomitant use of SSRI and 
direct oral anticoagulants, which showed a similarly increased risk 
of major bleeding as vitamin K antagonists.375,376 Potential interactions 
between antidepressants and drugs for SMI are summarized in 
Supplementary data online, Table S9.
6.5.4. Use of anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics
Anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics may be used to manage symptoms 
like anxiety and insomnia, which are common in the CVD population. 
However, potential benefits need to be balanced against risks, especially 
with long-term or high-dose use. If used, clinical evaluation should 
include assessment for suitability to switch to a safer alternative like 
SSRIs for anxiety, or CBT for insomnia. Further, these drugs are over­
used and overprescribed worldwide in the general population and es­
pecially among the elderly and people with mental health 
conditions.377 Benzodiazepine prescription, especially long-term or dai­
ly use, has been linked to an increased risk of all-cause mortality.378,379
These findings may be partly explained by residual confounding.380
Some studies also suggested that benzodiazepines may elevate the 
risk of CV events and mortality, particularly in older adults.381
6.5.5. Pharmacological treatment for mental health 
conditions in specific cardiovascular diseases
6.5.5.1. Ischaemic heart disease
Pharmacological treatment for IHD in people with mental health condi­
tions aims to reduce the symptoms of mental health conditions, improve 
CV outcomes, and reduce modifiable CV risk factors. In general, it is pref­
erable to avoid benzodiazepines routinely for managing AMI,382 and to be 
cautious about adding medications given the potential for interactions 
and possible side effects. In people who smoke, bupropion or varenicline 
can be used as they are effective and safe in reducing smoking in the short 
term.383,384 If a person with depression is being treated with mirtazapine, 
switching to other antidepressant drugs with less propensity to induce 
weight gain may be considered, in consultation with psychiatrists.356
6.5.5.2. Ventricular arrhythmias
In people with ventricular arrhythmias, it is necessary to evaluate the 
link between arrhythmias and the use of reported antidepressants. In 
the context of clinical suspicion, it is preferable to switch to drugs 
with less propensity to cause ventricular arrhythmias. Several antide­
pressants have shown a potential to change ventricular repolarization: 
(i) Citalopram/escitalopram possibly increase the risk of QTc pro­
longation in dosages over 20 mg compared with placebo.
(ii) TCAs are associated with increased risk of QTc prolongation com­
pared with newer antidepressants.
For more information on QTc prolongation associated with psycho­
tropic drugs see Section 7.6.1.
6.5.5.3. Heart failure
In people with HF, the efficacy of antidepressant and/or antipsychotic drugs 
is not well established.385 Therefore, careful assessment of risks and ben­
efits should be performed by a multidisciplinary Psycho-Cardio team be­
fore initiation. Indeed, despite mental health conditions increasing the 
risk for adverse outcomes and mortality in people with HF, the indiscrim­
inate use of antidepressants may increase the risk of CV side effects and 
drug interactions, especially among the elderly or frail. This is well summar­
ized in a position paper endorsed by the EAPC.386 In addition, the use of 
antidepressants has been associated with an increased risk for all-cause and 
CV mortality, irrespective of the presence of clinical depression.354,387
If antidepressants are needed: 
• SSRIs are considered the safer class of antidepressants to use in HF as 
they are associated with fewer adverse CV side effects (less likely to 
cause orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia, little effect on intraven­
tricular conduction).388 However, SSRIs can cause QTc prolongation, 
especially citalopram and escitalopram (but also sertraline and fluoxet­
ine), can increase the bleeding risk in elderly people receiving antiplate­
let or anticoagulant medications through their inhibition of platelet 
aggregation/activation, and enhance gastric acid secretion.372,389,390


<!-- PAGE 31 -->

### Page 31

• Due to their minimal inhibition of CYP enzymes, sertraline, citalo­
pram, and escitalopram have a lower risk of drug interactions com­
pared with fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and paroxetine.
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and TCAs should be avoided for the 
treatment of depression in HF as they may cause orthostatic hypo­
tension, worsening HF, and ventricular arrhythmias.391
• Venlafaxine and duloxetine should be used with caution in people 
with HF due to the small and contradictory evidence.392
The use of antidepressants in people with HF should be restricted to 
those with severe depression, where the risk of untreated depression 
outweighs the risk of taking antidepressants. The use of specific drugs 
for the treatment of HF can also be associated with the development 
of depression/anxiety: diuretics and nitrate esters are associated with 
a higher risk of depression in people with HF,393 while no increased 
risk of depression has been reported for beta-blockers (especially for 
the hydrophilic form since they do not significantly cross the blood/ 
brain barrier), statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angio­
tensin receptor blockers, aspirin, aldosterone antagonists, and sodium– 
glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors.393,394
6.5.5.4. Procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous 
coronary intervention)
In general, the use of benzodiazepines is not indicated for PCI or cor­
onary artery bypass grafting, but this consideration is based upon low- 
quality evidence.395,396 No specific recommendations are available for 
the use of psychotropic drugs.395
6.6. Organization of care
Healthcare is frequently fragmented by specialties, hindering efforts to 
provide holistic care that addresses physical and mental health condi­
tions. New care models have sought to integrate physical healthcare 
into mental healthcare settings, and mental healthcare into settings fo­
cused on physical conditions.397 Novel integrated programmes using 
remote delivery of mental health interventions and promoting psycho­
logical well-being have garnered growing interest in the literature.398
Several RCTs have explored the effectiveness of collaborative care 
models in managing various health conditions. Co-ordinated or 
collaborative care of people with CVD and other conditions has been 
shown to improve CV risk factors, cardiometabolic disease control, gen­
eral function, and symptoms of depression.399–402 A systematic review 
and meta-analysis of collaborative care in primary or community health­
care settings (79 trials) reported significantly greater improvements in 
depression and anxiety in the short and long term, along with increased 
medication use, mental health components of QoL measure (SF-12, 
SF-36), and satisfaction.403 However, an RCT of a collaborative care pro­
gramme for people with HF and depression did not show significant im­
provements in clinical outcomes compared with enhanced usual care.404
An integrated adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) psychology service 
has been shown to reduce psychological distress, however, few people 
received full psychological assessment.405 A recent position paper ad­
dresses the main mental health concerns in congenital heart disease 
and advocates the generation of models for the integration of mental 
health professionals in paediatric and ACHD teams.406
Although often delivered in primary care, collaborative care models 
have also been evaluated in rehabilitation facilities,407,408 and acute care 
hospitals.409 Collaborative care has been tested in mental health clinics 
and was found to improve physical health compared with usual care 
with no differences in overall QoL. Half of the effects on functioning 
were mediated through the effects of collaborative care on depression 
severity in people with bipolar depression.410,411
Collaborative care is usually delivered by nurses supported by a 
multidisciplinary team. Further study of novel applications of collabora­
tive care and related interventions is warranted due to the potential of 
these programmes to improve management of CVD and mental health 
conditions and enable CV practices to deliver holistic care.398 In par­
ticular, new models of integrated care with multidisciplinary teams 
(Psycho-Cardio team) and experts in improving mental health are 
needed in clinical CV care. The composition and function of these 
teams should be dynamic and flexible, adapted to the needs of people 
with CVD, their caregivers, clinical scenarios, and available resources. 
6.7. Section summary points and 
management consensus statements from 
Section 6
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
Ideally, assessment of mental health status should be performed routinely within CVD clinical practice and implemented when the context of local capacity 
and capability allows.
(ii)
Depression and anxiety can easily be overlooked in the routine care of people with CVD and/or considered ‘normal’ reactions to individual clinical/ 
prognostic burden of disease.
(iii)
Clinical history can be used to identify mental health symptoms. If there is clinical suspicion, formal screening with validated tools is advised.
(iv)
Psycho-Cardio teams are needed to structure pathways for: 
• Screening.
• Referral.
• Treatment of people with CVD and suspected or established mental health conditions.
(v)
Medical interventions including pharmacotherapy may be needed for people with CVD who are diagnosed with mental health conditions, especially for 
severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD.
(vi)
In some people with CVD, combination therapy of psychological interventions plus medication may be useful.

### 7 Severe mental illness and

cardiovascular disease
7.1. Cardiovascular risk in people with 
severe mental illness
Severe mental illnesses are diseases defined by a significantly impaired 
level of psychosocial functioning and usually comprise disorders such 
as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe recurrent major 
depressive disorder6 (Figure 11). Definitions and characteristics of SMI ac­
cording to ICD (International Classification of Diseases)-11 criteria,7 can 
be found in Supplementary data online, Table S11.
Individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been 
found to live approximately 14.5 and 8–12 years less than their coun­
terparts without SMI, respectively.412,413 All-cause mortality in people 
with SMI is more than 2.5 times higher compared with the general 
population,414 and the standardized mortality gap may be increasing 
over time.415 Cardiovascular disease plays a major role in cause- 
specific mortality among people with SMI,26 and SMI increases the in­
cidence and prevalence of CVD. People with schizophrenia are at 
two- to three-fold higher risk of having CVD, particularly younger in­
dividuals.12 In a large-scale meta-analysis (3 211 768 people with SMI; 
113 383 368 controls), the pooled prevalence of CVD was 9.9% and 
the cumulative incidence of CVD was 3.6% in people with SMI (me­
dian follow-up 8.4 years), a significantly higher adjusted risk of CVD 
incidence compared with controls in longitudinal studies.12 People 
with schizophrenia have significantly higher rates of SCD, exceeding 
population rates by 11-fold.416 There is some evidence to suggest 
young adults with SMI may be at particular risk of increased CV 
events.417,418
7.2. Prognosis in severe mental illness and 
cardiovascular disease
The co-occurrence of SMI and CVD increases all-cause mortality risk 
and worsens CV prognosis. Observational studies suggest that, among 
people with SMI, the risk for CHD and CV mortality is up to 2.5 times 
higher in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder compared 
with controls, with larger effects in younger people.419 According to 
Danish national registry data, while trends in MI mortality rates declined 
over 1 and 5 years of follow-up, people with schizophrenia did not ex­
perience the same decline in mortality rate following MI in long-term 
follow-up.420 People with SMI present clinically with HF 7 years earlier 
than the general population, and men with SMI and HF have excess 
mortality compared with men with HF without SMI. ICD implantation, 
cardiac resynchronization therapy, VAD implantation, and HTx 
are used at a similar rate in people with HF with reduced ejection frac­
tion and SMI as those without SMI, but people with SMI experienced 
poorer prognosis following cardiac resynchronization therapy, VAD, 
and HTx.421
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Screening of mental health with validated screening tools is advised after a new diagnosis or CV event, at least once during follow-up and anytime based on 
clinical judgement of need.
(ii)
Initial simple screening with a two-item measure (i.e. Whooley questions, PHQ-2, GAD-2) can be incorporated into routine practice.
(iii)
A low threshold for mental health screening in people with CVD is advised, considering the high prevalence of mental health conditions in people with CVD 
and its impact on outcomes.
(iv)
Following an abnormal result in the initial screening, a longer validated screening instrument should be used to determine if condition severity is low, 
moderate, or high.
(v)
Psycho-Cardio teams must define who is responsible for the assessment of mental health conditions and how and when it will be done, tailoring it to the 
specific context and resources.
(vi)
Each Psycho-Cardio team may choose a particular screening tool after careful assessment of its validity, reliability, and applicability to their population, but 
standardized screening tools are preferred for mental health assessment.
(vii)
People scoring high on a screening questionnaire need referral for diagnostic assessment and appropriate treatment by a mental health professional.
(viii)
Applying a stepped care approach to manage mental health conditions in people with CVD is reasonable based on preferences, severity of symptoms and 
condition, and resources available.
(ix)
Developing and evaluating tailored intervention programmes aimed at alleviating distress of people coping with CVD and caregivers may be useful.
(x)
Lifestyle measures and psycho-education are useful for all people with CVD while psychological therapies may be helpful for people experiencing 
depression and/or anxiety.
(xi)
Cardiac rehabilitation is an opportunity to screen people for depression and anxiety and can contribute to improve mental health after CV events or be an 
opportunity to identify and manage mental health conditions.
(xii)
Avoiding benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in the management of anxiety and depression is advised.
(xiii)
Anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics are overused and overprescribed in the general population, especially among the elderly and people with mental 
health conditions, so careful selection of indications is advisable.
(xiv)
Antidepressant use is advised for those with moderate to severe anxiety disorders and depression under the guidance of qualified mental health 
professionals.
(xv)
The use of antidepressants in HF is only advisable in severe depression symptoms where the risk of untreated depression outweighs the risk of taking 
antidepressants.
(xvi)
In people with ventricular arrhythmias, antidepressants associated with an increased propensity to prolong QTc (such as TCAs and possibly citalopram/ 
escitalopram in dosages over 20 mg), may be switched to newer antidepressants with better safety profiles.
(xvii)
Given the frequent interactions between antidepressants and CV drugs affecting their efficacy and safety, therapeutic drug monitoring is advisable to 
optimize pharmacotherapy and minimize potential side effects and clinically relevant drug interactions.

7.3. Increased cardiovascular disease risk 
in people with severe mental illness
The aetiology of CVD in people with SMI is multifactorial, involving gen­
etic/biological, disease-specific and treatment-specific effects, lifestyle 
factors, and treatment disparities, which are mutually inter­
twined.422,423 A summary of these factors is given in Figure 12, and de­
scribed in the text below.
7.3.1. Lifestyle and biological risk factors
Risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, 
obesity, and smoking, contribute to a significantly higher CV risk in 
people with SMI.424,425 Genetic/biological, disease-specific factors in­
clude common genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia and diabetes, 
the effects of psychopathology such as negative and depressive symp­
toms leading to sedentary lifestyle.424 Schizophrenia is associated 
with more than a three-fold risk of obesity compared with the 
general population,426 and metabolic syndrome and diabetes were 
also found to be more prevalent in people with schizophrenia and bi­
polar disorder.426–429 Hypertension was found to be more prevalent 
in people with bipolar disorders, but not schizophrenia.430 Finally, 
people with schizophrenia had five times higher odds of smoking 
than the general population,431 up to 65% of people with schizophre­
nia are smokers,432,433 and they have higher rates of alcohol addic­
tion.434 People with SMI have not shown the same reduction of 
modifiable risk factors and resulting decrease in CVD mortality rates 
as the general population.419
7.3.2. Medication-induced cardiovascular risk factors
Disease-specific and medication-induced factors include side effects to 
medications, obesity, diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hypercholes­
terolaemia.427,435–438 The effect of medication is not straightforward, as 
metabolic-induced side effects may not be independent predictors for

CVD in persons with SMI.438,439 A summary of data on CV risk asso­
ciated with antipsychotic use is highlighted below: 
• Current reports do not show that antipsychotics are associated 
with increased risk of MI or stroke in people with schizophrenia 
and bipolar disorder compared with placebo,440 despite previous 
meta-analyses.12,441
• The use of long-acting antipsychotic medication and second- 
generation antipsychotics were found protective against all-cause 
mortality compared with no antipsychotic use. The largest effects 
were seen for second-generation long-acting injectable antipsycho­
tics, clozapine, any long-acting injectable antipsychotics, and any 
second-generation antipsychotics.26 In a Finnish nationwide data­
base study (median follow-up 14.1 years), CV mortality was significant­
ly lower among patients with schizophrenia on any antipsychotic 
treatment compared with non-use. Several antipsychotics were asso­
ciated with a significantly reduced CV death risk compared with 
non-use (long-acting injectable olanzapine and oral flupentixol) and 
the use of clozapine reduced all-cause mortality by 61% and CV death 
risk by 45% compared with non-use of antipsychotics.442 Findings were 
possibly explained by improved adherence to antipsychotics of people 
with SMI, as this has been associated with decreased discontinuation 
risk of antidiabetics, statins, antihypertensives, and beta-blockers in 
people with schizophrenia.443 The use of medication appears not to 
influence the cardiorespiratory fitness level of people with SMI receiv­
ing treatment.444
Antipsychotics vary in their propensity to induce modifiable CVD 
risk factors. Most second-generation antipsychotics with wide receptor 
activity profiles (serotonin 5-HT2A, histamine H1, muscarinic M3), such 
as olanzapine, clozapine, and quetiapine, are associated with increased 
risk of weight gain and consequent metabolic syndrome, weight gain- 
related diabetes, and hypertriglyceridaemia.437
According to a 
meta-analysis of RCTs, olanzapine, clozapine, zotepine, sertindole,

iloperidone, and quetiapine were found to be associated with worse 
metabolic profiles (weight gain, glucose increase, hypertriglyceridaemia, 
hypercholesterolaemia, and decrease of high-density lipoprotein chol­
esterol) in short-term use.435 Zotepine, olanzapine, sertindole, caripra­
zine, iloperidone, quetiapine, clozapine, and risperidone have been 
associated with the greatest weight gain (up to 3 kg), but nearly half 
of antipsychotics caused significantly more weight gain than pla­
cebo.445,446 A summary of effects of antipsychotics on CVD modifiable 
risk factors is presented in Table 6.
7.3.3. Assessing cardiovascular disease risk
Widely used tools for CV risk assessment in the general population usu­
ally underestimate the risk of CVD in the population with SMI.447
Significant differences in risk prediction screening tools such as metabolic 
syndrome concept, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) mod­
el and two PRedIction and Management of cardiovascular Risk in 
peOple with SEvere mental illnesses (PRIMROSE) models, carry the 
risk of significant disparities in treatment initiation in people with 
SMI.447 Moreover, these models generally underestimate CV risk in 
adolescents with SMI.447,448 Finally, there is no consensus of which 
healthcare professionals should screen and monitor for CVD in SMI. 
While screening is usually in the domain of primary care, persons 
with SMI have overall low use of health services, therefore, 
mental health professionals may need to take the lead for screening,21
diagnostics,22,23 and treatment.21,24–26
Several practice Guidelines for the screening and monitoring of CV 
risk in people with schizophrenia are proposed but have been scarcely 
implemented. Position statements by the European Psychiatric 
Association, supported by the European Association for the Study of 
Diabetes (EASD), and the ESC have made recommendations for 
screening.449 We highlight the following as particularly important for 
people with SMI and CVD: 
• Routine screening for CVD risk factors should be performed by psy­
chiatrists and general practitioners at all stages of the disorder, re­
gardless of age, with initial risk assessment carried out during the 
first visit and before the prescription of antipsychotics. Baseline risk 
assessment includes: 
⚬Personal and family history of CVD or diabetes or related disease.
⚬Lifestyle patterns: smoking and alcohol consumption, healthy diet, 
physical activity.
⚬Weight, height, waist circumference, calculation of body mass 
index.
⚬Fasting blood glucose and lipids (total cholesterol, low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
triglycerides).
⚬Blood pressure, heart rate.
• All individuals with SMI taking antipsychotics should be actively mon­
itored for modifiable risk factors at baseline, after 12 weeks, and at 
least annually thereafter.
• People who have CV risk factors should be monitored at the start of 
a new treatment and re-assessed 6 and 12 weeks after initiation of a 
new antipsychotic drug, and periodically, depending on the presence 
of risk factors.449 In people with diabetes, monitoring should include 
glycated haemoglobin every 12 weeks.
• After initiation of antipsychotics known to induce CV side effects [e.g. 
prolongation of QTc interval or tachycardia (see Section 7.6.1)], elec­
trocardiogram (ECG) is advised at baseline, after 1 week, and after 6 
and 12 weeks, and annually thereafter.

7.4. Gaps and disparities in the 
management of cardiovascular disease in 
people with severe mental illness
The presence of SMI in itself does not explain the lifespan 
inequalities observed.450 Multiple factors have been identified including 
systemic barriers to prevention,310 screening,21 diagnosis,22,23 and 
treatment.21,24–26 Collectively, these lead to large healthcare disparities 
for people with SMI. Key studies confirm these inequalities persist in 
CVD.451–454 To overcome these barriers healthcare professionals 
need to be aware of, and address, system-level problems including stig­
ma, stereotypes, prejudice, and diagnostic overshadowing (defined as 
the misattribution of physical symptoms to pre-existing psychological 
illnesses).455
7.4.1. Autonomy, communication, and informed 
consent
Communication between the CV team and people with SMI and CVD 
should follow similar principles as for people with CVD without SMI 
outlined in Section 6.3. For people with SMI, this may require a move 
away from the established ‘best interest’ approach (healthcare profes­
sionals know what is best), to a ‘will and preference’ approach which 
prioritizes goals and values.456 This shift is particularly critical for people 
with SMI and CVD, who may experience heightened stigma or bias that 
can lead to paternalistic treatment. Respecting their will and preference 
not only affirms their human right to self-determination and dignity, but 
also allows them greater control over their care, promoting a sense of 
ownership in managing their health. The Psycho-Cardio team should 
develop a more proactive and person-centred approach in caring for 
persons with SMI including: 
• Educating the people about their illness, warning signs, treatment, and 
management plan.
• Including people with SMI and family/caregivers in the management 
plan using SDM.
• Engaging people with SMI to participate in their care actively by in­
cluding them in all forms of treatment (lifestyle modification pro­
grammes, smoking cessation).
• Encouraging people with SMI to check up regularly for CVD risks and 
CV symptoms.
• Monitoring adherence to medication.
• Reassuring and signposting to practical information or resources.
• Asking if there is someone the person with SMI would like you to 
contact.
People with SMI are presumed to have capacity to consent to treat­
ment unless there is reason to believe this is not the case. In those rare 
situations, a decision-making capacity assessment may be required, and 
this should be undertaken by the professionals involved in delivering the 
physical health intervention being proposed. Depending on jurisdiction, 
people with SMI may have appointed a decision-maker themselves or 
may have an advanced healthcare directive, so it is important to be 
aware of these issues and determine a person’s capacity to consent 
to treatment before proceeding.
If the person with SMI already has a legal guardian, they have the legal 
authority to sign medical informed consent, but different acts may be 
applied in different countries. People with SMI may have reduced ability 
to participate in the treatment processes due to the nature of SMI lead­
ing to unintentional non-adherence. In severe active psychosis, the indi­
vidual may not be able to communicate CV symptoms or may not be 
able to tolerate invasive investigations and/or therapies because of psy­
chiatric symptoms.
Many people with SMI may become suitable for an invasive strategy and 
be clinically assessed for CV interventions. This may require an advocating 
and assertive approach by the management team, and close collaboration 
with liaising mental health professionals and general practitioners. The 
management of CAD in people with SMI should be discussed by the 
Psycho-Cardio team (Figure 3), with input from a psychiatrist. Many defi­
ciencies in the management of CAD in people with SMI occur for obvious 
and at times insurmountable reasons. Consensus and collaboration 
among people with SMI, families, general practitioners/family physicians, 
CV specialists, and mental health professionals is essential for good prac­
tice. General practitioners play a particularly relevant role in reviewing and 
optimizing the physical and mental health of people with SMI and CVD, 
being responsible for the integral process of care and co-ordinating 
care by the different specialists involved.
In the care of SMI, flexible assertive community treatment models 
usually ensure better availability of health services for persons with 
SMI and prominent psychiatric symptoms, but there is a lack of studies 
analysing the effects of these models in people with CVD.457,458
Interactive telemedicine (therapy delivered via video conferencing) 
was found comparable to in-person delivery in effectiveness, accept­
ability, and cost in people with various mental health and substance 
abuse issues.459
7.5. Management of cardiovascular disease 
in people with severe mental illness
7.5.1. Management of modifiable risk factors
Management of modifiable risk factors in people with SMI follow the 
same principles as in people without SMI, such as education, behaviour­
al counselling, lifestyle interventions, and peer and family support inter­
ventions. Increased efficacy of interventions directed to improve CV 
risk in people with SMI is associated with: 
• High intensity and high co-ordination.
• Inclusion of both behavioural and pharmacological management, fol­
lowing a multimorbidity approach.
Few studies, however, have evaluated interventions addressing one 
or more CVD risk factors in people with SMI.
7.5.2. Diet, physical activity, and body weight control
The diet of people with schizophrenia is often unhealthy, characterized 
as being poor in fibre and fruit, and rich in saturated fats with a high cal­
oric intake.460 People with SMI are generally less physically active than 
the general population, performing significantly lower volumes of mod­
erate to vigorous activity per day according to a meta-analysis of 69 
studies.424 Currently available studies in people with SMI indicate a 
beneficial effect of exercise and diet on CV risk, with interventions in­
creasing weekly activity compared with no intervention.461 Significant 
improvements in fitness, psychiatric symptoms, and overall functioning 
were found in participants who attended 50% of physical activity ses­
sions.462 The European Psychiatric Association (EPA) suggests that


<!-- PAGE 37 -->

### Page 37

physical activity should be regularly offered to people with SMI as a low 
risk and accessible way of improving health.463
In general, weight loss should be advised to people with SMI who 
have a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 or a waist circumference ≥88 cm 
in women or ≥102 cm in men.449 The effectiveness of behavioural or 
integrative interventions to improve CV risk in people with SMI has 
had mixed results.422 Two of four studies reported a decrease in CV 
risk in the integrated care intervention group compared with control 
groups, however, two studies reported no difference.464–467
Glucose and lipid-related laboratory results were mainly reported as 
secondary outcome assessments in studies of weight management in­
terventions. Metformin is the currently accepted first-line treatment 
of antipsychotic-associated weight gain, although not all people bene­
fit.468 In 2020, the ESC in collaboration with the EASD updated their 
treatment algorithms to recommend the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonists and sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors as 
alternate therapy options to metformin based on CV and renal co­
morbidities independent of glycaemic control. However, there are still 
no data to support their use for antipsychotic-associated weight gain 
and diabetes.469 In a meta-analysis of 33 RCTs (3473 people with 
SMI), weight control was improved with behavioural interventions 
compared with control, metformin, anticonvulsive medications topira­
mate and zonisamide, and adjunctive or antipsychotic switching to ari­
piprazole (meta-analysis not possible). Evidence was insufficient for all 
other interventions and for effects on glucose and lipid control.470
7.5.3. Smoking cessation
Smoking cessation strategies for persons with SMI are similar to the gen­
eral population as summarized previously (Section 6.3.10), including ap­
propriate pharmacological therapy in combination with behavioural 
therapy. Brief behavioural interventions (motivational enhancement, per­
sonalized feedback) have increased rates of pursuing nicotine 
dependence treatment compared with psycho-education in people 
with schizophrenia.471 Studies have confirmed the safety and efficacy 
of first-line smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, including varenicline, 
bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy, and nicotine patch monother­
apy in individuals with and without schizophrenia or schizoaffective dis­
orders.384,472–474 Although studies do not indicate a serious safety 
signal with varenicline or bupropion, there is a general risk of deterio­
rated mental health in association with smoking cessation due to nicotine 
abstinence. People with previous mental health issues should be well in­
formed and followed up carefully during smoking cessation interventions.
Maintenance of pharmacotherapeutic and behavioural treatment has 
been reported to significantly reduce relapse rates among smokers with 
schizophrenia.471 Smoking cessation has a double benefit effect as it also 
potentially enables the need for a lower dose of antipsychotic treatment. 
Specifically, smoking can influence the efficacy of multiple medications used 
in the treatment of SMI through CYP1A2 induction, reducing plasma levels 
of some drugs (Supplementary data online, Table S10). Therefore, smoking 
cessation may lead to increased plasma levels of these drugs (e.g. clozapine) 
and thus doses of medications may need to be reduced when someone 
stops smoking, in consultation with psychiatrist.
7.5.4. Pharmacological management
Psychiatric medication in people with SMI is prescribed long term with a 
variety of psychotropic medications, depending largely on the state of 
the disease and comorbidities. People with schizophrenia, other psych­
otic disorders, and bipolar disorders are treated with antipsychotics, 
sometimes in combination with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, 
and frequently anxiolytics or sedatives. The same is true for severe re­
current depression, where antipsychotics are added to antidepressants. 
CYP450 pharmacokinetic profiles of psychotropic medications can be 
found in Supplementary data online, Table S10.
While pharmacologic treatment in SMI is associated with decreased 
risk of CVD compared with no treatment, a rational pharmacotherapy 
is needed as some medications are associated with CV risks. As dis­
cussed in Section 7.6 these include the development of CV side effects 
via receptor blockade of muscarinic receptors and adrenergic recep­
tors and worsening modifiable CV risk factors.475
Rational pharmacotherapy for persons with SMI takes a multifactor­
ial approach as outlined in the principles below: 
• Use of monotherapy whenever possible.
• Use of medication with lower propensity to induce or worsen CV risk.
• Addition of medication to prevent CV risk factors (e.g. metformin or 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to prevent weight gain).
• Consideration of possible drug interactions and monitoring for CV 
side effects upon initiation of a new drug.
• Ensuring adequate adherence to psychiatric medication.
People with SMI respond to the same strategies to increase adher­
ence as those without SMI, including simplifying medication regimens 
and use of behavioural interventions. Text message reminders, phone 
calls, electronic pill counters, and training family members can improve 
medication adherence in SMI populations.422
7.6. Management of cardiovascular 
conditions in people with severe mental 
illness
Managing CVD in people with SMI requires good communication and 
collaboration between mental health and CV specialists. Several factors 
that may help improve CVD management and secondary prevention in 
those with CV conditions are listed below and summarized in Figure 13. 
• Raise awareness of specialists and primary care professionals regard­
ing the importance of controlling CV risk factors.
• Promote adherence to psychotropic drugs; long-acting injectables 
may help.
• Decrease the number of psychotropic drugs if possible.
• Switch to drugs with less propensity to induce metabolic syndrome, 
in consultation with psychiatrists and evaluation of relapse risk.476
• Reinforce lifestyle modifications and prescribe CV prevention medi­
cations as needed.
• Addition of varenicline/bupropion or other forms of nicotine re­
placement therapy combined with smoking cessation programmes 
in case of smoking.
7.6.1. Rhythm disturbances
People with SMI are at increased risk of developing supraventricular and 
ventricular arrhythmias, which may eventually lead to SCD. This in­
creased arrhythmia risk is multifactorial, including distress resulting 
from the SMI, high prevalence of risk factors and unhealthy lifestyles, 
CV comorbidities commonly observed in SMI, and side effects of psy­
chotropic medications. Furthermore, autonomic dysfunction, chronic 
inflammation, and oxidative stress are common in SMI and have been 
associated with an increased arrhythmia risk.423

of SMI. The risk of SCD is significantly increased in people with SMI 
with estimates suggesting a two- to four-fold higher risk compared 
with the general population.298 Several medications prescribed to 
persons with SMI have potential pro-arrhythmic side effects and 
may cause or exacerbate atrial and ventricular tachycardia. Caution 
and careful monitoring are needed when prescribing potentially 
pro-arrhythmic drugs in people with known heart disease, with 
the following considerations: quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, ilo­
peridone, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and sertindole increase the risk of 
QTc prolongation compared with placebo.477
• Iloperidone, chlorpromazine, loxapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and pa­
liperidone increase the risk of tachycardia compared with placebo.478
• Low-potency first-generation antipsychotics and multi-acting 
receptor-targeted second-generation antipsychotic treatment (spe­
cifically clozapine, chlorpromazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risper­
idone) are associated with an increased risk of AF especially in those 
with hypertension, diabetes, or CAD although evidence is limited.479
• Lithium may induce electrocardiographic changes and arrhythmias 
such as T-wave inversions, sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, PR pro­
longation, incomplete bundle branch block, QTc prolongation, in­
creased QT dispersion, the Brugada electrocardiographic pattern, 
and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.480
The risk of AF appears not to be generally increased among people 
with SMI after adjustment for sex and age, although this may reflect un­
derdiagnosis of AF and misinterpretation of palpitation symp­
toms.423,479,481 In a study from Korea, young adults (20–39 years) 
diagnosed with mental disorder had a higher risk of incident AF (ad­
justed HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.44–1.62).482
7.6.1.1. QTc interval prolongation
QTc intervals can be prolonged in association with several antipsychot­
ic drugs such as sertindole, amisulpride, ziprasidone, iloperidone, risper­
idone, olanzapine, and quetiapine.477 This effect may be more common 
in women than men due to differences in pharmacokinetic profiles.483
A prolongation of the QTc interval increases the risk of torsades de 
pointes tachycardias and SCD. Therefore, a 12-lead ECG should be re­
corded before and after initiation of antipsychotic drugs and further 
ECG controls performed on a yearly basis during long-term follow-up.
Prolonged QTc in response to antipsychotic medication may indicate 
acquired long QT syndrome and/or reveal an underlying genetic predis­
position. Diagnosis and management of long QT syndrome in SMI 
should follow general Guidelines.484
• Acquired long QT syndrome is usually defined by a QTc of >500 ms 
or a drug-induced change from baseline >60–70 ms.485
• In people with QTc intervals >500 ms, suspected causal drugs should 
be stopped and switched to alternative medication with lower 
QT-prolonging properties and be evaluated by a cardiologist for 
underlying genetic conditions.
• In cases of intermediate QTc prolongation (e.g. ≥470 ms in men; 
≥480 ms in women), dose reduction or switching to a different 
antipsychotic may be considered and repeated ECGs should be 
documented. Individualized risk-benefit assessments are useful, con­
sidering the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation, 
symptoms, and the QT-prolonging potential of the prescribed 
medication.
• Given that QT-prolonging effects are dose dependent, always aim for 
the lowest effective dose. Interactions with other QT-prolonging 
drugs like amiodarone, sotalol, or erythromycin should be avoided.
• The inherent risk of QT prolongation associated with specific drugs is 
provided on the CredibleMeds website.486
• QT prolongation may also be the effect of other reversible causes 
such as hypokalaemia, hypothyroidism, or bradycardia.
• Sinus tachycardia is common in SMI, heart rate correction of the QT 
interval with the Fridericia formula is optimal, rather than Bazett’s 
formula which overestimates QT at higher heart rates.487
• The measurement of QT intervals can be complicated by abnormal 
T-wave morphology requiring expert consultation for correct 
interpretation.477,483
7.6.1.2. Heart rate changes
Both tachycardia and bradycardia are side effects of antipsychotic medi­
cation.478 Sinus tachycardia has been reported with most antipsychotic 
medications, including first- and second-generation therapies. It is most 
common with clozapine (17%–33%),488 but has usually a transient and 
benign course. However, possible medical causes of sinus tachycardia 
should be excluded. In those with symptoms, rate control with cardio- 
selective beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or ivabradine may be 
used. Persistent heart rates above 130 beats per minute (b.p.m) may in 
rare cases cause a tachycardiomyopathy, which is usually reversible by 
improved rate control.
Bradycardia is a rare side effect of antipsychotics, with incidence not 
significantly higher compared with controls.478 Bradycardia warrants 
careful clinical attention in people at risk, e.g. in those with pre-existing 
conduction disturbances or symptoms like dizziness or syncope.
Lithium has a unique mechanism of action and a narrow therapeutic 
window. Common side effects include sinus node dysfunction, bradycar­
dia, conduction delays (e.g. atrioventricular block, bundle branch block) 
but also precordial T-wave changes including Brugada pattern, and QT 
prolongation. Prolonged use and high blood levels increase the complica­
tion risk making maintenance of optimal lithium serum levels essential.480
Since lithium concentration is affected by sodium, conditions like dehy­
dration or renal failure must be managed carefully. However, with appro­
priate monitoring, lithium does not pose a significant CV risk.478,480
In summary, in people with SMI and arrhythmias, it is necessary to 
evaluate the link between arrhythmias and antipsychotics. If clinically 
suspected, switching to other drugs with less propensity to cause 
changes in heart rhythm may be appropriate, however, this must be ba­
lanced against the risk of SMI relapse. Clozapine, as the only medication 
indicated in people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, is often 
hard to switch due to a high risk of relapse. A decision algorithm is given 
in Figure 14 and additional information is provided in Table 7.
7.6.2. Clozapine-induced myocarditis
Although clozapine has been associated with an increased risk of develop­
ing myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, reviews and meta-analyses show that 
event rates and death rates are low. Results are limited by inconsistency in 
the diagnostic criteria for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy.489 The odds of 
clozapine-induced myocarditis increased with concurrent sodium valpro­
ate use, and possibly increasing age and higher clozapine dose.490
If clozapine-induced myocarditis or cardiomyopathy is suspected, 
treatment should be discontinued promptly and referred urgently to 
a cardiologist for diagnostic evaluation.491 People who have persistent 
tachycardia at rest, especially during the first 2 months of treatment, 
should be closely observed for other signs or symptoms of myocarditis 
or cardiomyopathy (palpitations, arrhythmias, symptoms mimicking MI, 
chest pain, and other unexplained symptoms of HF). However, special­
ist advice and link with psychiatrists is needed to prevent inappropriate 
discontinuation of clozapine.

7.7. Interventions to improve the 
management of people with severe mental 
illness and cardiovascular disease
Existing programmes of prevention, early detection, and treatment of 
CVD have not consistently and significantly improved the CV risk profile 
in people with schizophrenia and other SMI conditions.492 Poor motiv­
ation, lack of insight and cognitive impairment, and limited participation 
in decision-making by persons with SMI may be contributing to non- 
adherence to prevention, diagnostic, and treatment programmes. 
Cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment programmes need to 
work with mental health experts to provide CVD screening and care 
that is accessible and appropriate for people with SMI.

Supporting information
Assess symptoms
Typically, asymptomatic 
In case of torsades de pointes: palpitations, dizziness, syncope, cardiac arrest.
Diagnostic 
work-up
• 12-lead ECG providing QTc at baseline and after 1, 6, and 12 weeks after initiating drug
• ECG more often in case of QT prolongation
• Use Fridericia formula for heart rate correction if there is tachycardia
• Check electrolytes: potassium, calcium, magnesium
• Ambulatory ECG monitoring in people with symptoms
• Exclude possible inherited long QT syndrome.
Management
Special caution with: sertindole, amisulpride, ziprasidone, iloperidone, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine 
• Always aim for the lowest effective dose
• Check for other QT-prolonging drugs
• Check for drug interactions
• Always special caution when new medication is started
• Consult https://www.crediblemeds.org/ for specific information on QT-prolonging drug effects
• Correct electrolyte imbalances
• Address other reversible QT-prolonging factors (e.g. bradycardia, hypothyroidism, starvation/eating disorders, alcohol and substance 
abuse, myocardial ischaemia)
Note other non-reversible potentially QT-prolonging factors: heart failure, ventricular hypertrophy, recent conversion from atrial 
fibrillation, impaired hepatic/renal function, female sex, age over 65 years 
If QTc is prolonged (>470 ms) at baseline, treatment initiation is generally not recommended and should be carefully considered based 
on individualized risk-benefit assessment (Psycho-Cardio team)a.
Special 
precautions
Stop treatment with antipsychotic drug (and any other potentially QT-prolonging medication) if: 
• QTc >500 msb
• Increase in QTc >60–70 ms from baselinec.

ECG, electrocardiogram; QTc, corrected QT interval.
aQTc prolongation (>470 ms) during treatment warrants repeated ECG documentation and thorough evaluation of symptoms and additional risk factors for QT prolongation. Dose 
reduction or switching to a different antipsychotic drug may be considered in selected cases after individualized risk-benefit assessment (Psycho-Cardio team).
bRequest urgent consultation with Psycho-Cardio team/cardiologist.
cRequest urgent consultation with Psycho-Cardio team/cardiologist, repeat ECG.
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
The presence of SMI increases CV risk, especially in younger people.
(ii)
Regular CV risk assessment is essential in people with SMI regardless 
of age, to prevent the development or progression of CVD, ideally 
Continued before the prescription of antipsychotics and, afterwards, periodically 
in all stages of illness.
(iii)
Management of CVD in people with SMI aims to reduce modifiable 
CV risk factors, including weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, 
dyslipidaemia, smoking, unhealthy diet, and sedentary lifestyle  
habits.
(iv)
CVD management in people with SMI benefits from optimizing SMI 
pharmacotherapy: (i) preferring monotherapy, (ii) using 
medications less likely to induce weight gain or other CV risks, (iii) 
monitoring for possible drug interactions and side effects, and (iv) 
ensuring medication adherence.
(v)
Efforts to alleviate the impact of psychosocial and stress-related 
factors are needed in people with SMI.
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Addressing stigma and managing CVD in people with SMI in 
accordance with CV Guidelines and best clinical practice is a 
responsibility of all healthcare professionals.
(ii)
CV care for people with SMI can be improved by following a holistic 
person-centred approach, involving close collaboration between the 
Psycho-Cardio team with psychiatrists, general practitioners, and 
sometimes other specialists to proactively facilitate the engagement of 
people with SMI in such programmes.

### 8 Mental health in specific

populations and situations
8.1. Sex and gender differences in mental 
health and cardiovascular disease
Biological (‘sex’) and sociocultural (‘gender’) aspects may explain differ­
ences or disparities between women and men in incidence, prevalence, 
presentation, diagnosis, management, and response to treatment in CV 
and mental health conditions (Figure 15). Sex reflects biological factors 
like genetics, anatomy, physiology, and hormones, while gender involves 
socially constructed norms shaping roles, relationships, and power dy­
namics. Gender interacts with sex, affecting traits that define women, 
men, and intersex individuals. Pregnancy and menopause are clear ex­
amples of the differential influence of sex and gender in CV and mental 
well-being. Multiple studies and analyses have shown that: 
• Depression and anxiety are twice as prevalent in women, have increased 
more in women over the past two decades compared with men, and 
are important risk factors for ACS and CV mortality.94,493–495
• Risk ratio for psychosocial factors is higher in women with CVD com­
pared with men with CVD (RR 25.7 vs 21.7, respectively).56,496
• The association between depression or anxiety and CVD risk is 
stronger in young and middle-aged women compared with men.94,497
• Women experience a greater impact from chronic self-perceived 
stress and marital stress, whilst men are more affected by job-related 
stress.498
However, this has to be interpreted in the context of the following 
factors: (i) prevailing social norms may lead to underreporting of mental 
stress in men,499,500 and (ii) men may have better perceived health 
and less anxiety than women, despite reporting more health risk 
behaviours.501
Sex differences in stress response have been seen in animal and hu­
man models.502,503 Although pre-clinical studies in rodents and neuro­
biological studies in the past have predominantly been done in males, 
evidence of sex differences in neurobiological alterations in people 
with depression and anxiety is mounting.504–507 These are associated 
with genetic differences, inflammation, platelet activation, sympathetic 
function, and hormone-related receptor signalling pathways.

Some SES factors like educational level and sex-specific life events 
(i.e. pregnancy, sexual abuse, intimate partner violence), have a different 
impact on the stress response in women and men. Women have a high­
er inflammatory response to stress compared with men, which is asso­
ciated with future adverse CV outcomes in people with IHD.508 The 
association between menopause transition and depression remains 
contentious, although severe vasomotor symptoms are recognized as 
a contributing factor associated with depression.509,510 Hormonal 
changes during menopause transition frequently induce mood distur­
bances, adversely impacting QoL and work performance.511,512
During peri-menopause but not in post-menopause, temporary hor­
mone therapy may alleviate these symptoms.511,512
In men, erectile dysfunction has not only been shown to be a conse­
quence of CVD, it is also a risk marker for future CVD.513 A recent 
meta-analysis demonstrated that sexual dysfunction is also a predictor 
of future CVD in women.514
8.1.1. Cardiovascular disease and mental health 
conditions in transgender individuals
Transgender individuals show a significantly higher risk for mental 
health conditions, including suicidality, social disintegration, and margin­
alization, compared with non-transgender individuals.515 High rates of 
discrimination and low levels of social support predispose to addictive 
behaviours in transgender persons,516 but insufficient data are available 
to differentiate between transgender subgroups. Gender-affirming 
therapy, including sex hormones, aligns individuals with their gender 
identity, enhancing QoL.517 The psychosocial benefits of hormone 
therapy with an improved body image may result in healthier lifestyle 
choices. Evidence in the ageing transgender population suggests that 
both transgender men and women face a 40% higher risk of CVD com­
pared with cisgender peers of the same birth sex.518–521 The hypercoa­
gulable effect of exogenous sex hormones, alongside the increase in 
traditional CVD risk factors, may mediate this elevated risk.
8.1.2. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
people with obstructive coronary artery disease
The impact of a life event like a diagnosis of CVD on mental stress af­
fects all genders. However, long-term population studies evaluating 
their influence according to sex and gender are scarce. Negative stress 
leads more often to adverse lifestyle behaviours and substance use in 
men, whereas sociocultural inequalities, household problems, and 
ACEs more often negatively affect women with CVD.522 Countries 
with the highest levels of gender equity have reported some of the 
greatest reductions in 40 year CVD mortality rates.496,523
The negative impact of depression on obstructive CAD in women is 
relatively more severe in younger women (<55 years) than at older 
ages.510,524 Moreover, feminine gender roles, lower educational level, 
and distress-related psychological factors such as anxiety are important 
determinants of outcomes after ACS in both sexes.525 Meta-analyses of 
negative psychological factors on obstructive CAD found no significant 
differences among men and women.106,526 In clinical practice, however, 
sex and gender differences in heart–brain interactions importantly con­
tribute to different manifestations of stable and unstable IHD.507,527
8.1.3. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
ischaemia/angina with non-obstructive coronary 
arteries and coronary vasomotor disorders
Psychological risk factors, including depression and anxiety are preva­
lent among women with myocardial ischaemia or angina with non- 
obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA/ANOCA).56 Mental stress trig­
gers endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.528–531 While some 
studies associate anxiety with INOCA/ANOCA, others found no link 
between depression or general anxiety and these conditions.532,533
Mental stress-induced ischaemia, more prevalent in women than 
men, correlates with adverse CV outcomes.534,535 This may be asso­
ciated with worse long-term prognosis, particularly in women.536,537
The influence of mental stress on INOCA/ANOCA contributes to 
their underdiagnosis and undertreatment in women.538
Young women with a history of ACS have a two-fold higher likeli­
hood of developing mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia com­
pared with men.535 Chronic mental stress is a significant trigger for 
spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), which is nine times 
more common in women.539–541 Emotional stressors are reported 
twice as frequently prior to SCAD-ACS as by other ACS cohorts.542,543
Since most people experiencing SCAD are relatively young (40–60 
years), rehabilitation should prioritize stress management, addressing 
work-life balance, and other present stressors. Psychological counsel­
ling may be needed in selected people.
8.1.4. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
people with takotsubo syndrome
Acute stress-induced takotsubo syndrome (TTS) occurs eight–nine times 
more frequently in women than in men, likely due to different coping 
strategies for stress.544 Women over 55 years of age are five times 
more likely to develop TTS compared with younger women, as risk is 
linked to increased sympathetic tone after menopause.545,546 While phys­
ical stressors more often affect men, women are more likely to experience 
an emotional trigger.547,548 These different triggers suggest two categories 
of TTS:549 primary TTS, affecting women after emotional stress with lim­
ited left ventricular dysfunction, and TTS triggered by physical stress, 
which causes more severe left ventricular dysfunction and a worse prog­
nosis. The latter seems to affect women and men equally. A direct connec­
tion between the brain and the heart associated with autonomic functions 
and regulation of the limbic system has been identified.550 Mental health 
conditions are common in people with TTS, indicating that combined psy­
chotherapy and ECR could improve mental health and reduce negative 
thinking more effectively than ECR alone.350 People with pre-admission 
psychiatric disorders are at a higher risk of recurrent TTS.551 The use 
of SSRIs may help prevent recurrence in selected individuals.551
8.1.5. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
people with heart failure
Women are underrepresented in most HF trials, leading to a lack of 
sex- and gender-specific data on the impact of mental health conditions. 
HF prevalence varies between the sexes: men typically present with HF 
with reduced ejection fraction following ACS, while women more often 
experience HF with preserved ejection fraction due to hypertension, 
obesity, and ageing.552 Sexual dimorphism is also evident in the expres­
sion of hereditary cardiomyopathies and risk factors like breast cancer, 
and the potential treatment-induced cardiomyopathy. Additionally, 
there are sex-specific disorders such as peri-partum cardiomyopathy.
Psychological stress has received limited attention as a potential dis­
ease modifier in HF. As HF with preserved ejection fraction often re­
mains undiagnosed, this contributes additional stress on the affected 
predominantly female population. However, qualitative studies support 
the assertion of non-diagnosis burden.553,554 The progressive course of 
HF, with increasing functional limitations, further increases stress in 
both males and females.

Higher psychological stress and anxiety worsen HF out­
comes.215,216,555,556 Women with HF, former smokers, those with low­
er income, and people with obesity report higher perceived stress, as 
do people with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II HF, com­
pared with asymptomatic NYHA class I HF.215,557 Social determinants 
of health influence HF prevalence, with the highest rates of HF and re­
lated readmissions observed in the most economically disadvantaged 
communities with more representation of women and individuals 
from ethnically diverse backgrounds.558
8.1.6. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
people with arrhythmias
In people with AF, anxiety levels are significantly higher in women com­
pared with men, potentially due to older age, living alone (e.g. divorced/ 
widowed), or comorbid conditions.559 Chronic AF increases anxiety, 
depression, and affects QoL in both genders, but the effect is more pro­
nounced in women.560 Depression is more common in women with 
chronic AF,561 and affects the subjective burden of symptoms, suggest­
ing that addressing psychological comorbidities may improve symptom 
management and HRQoL. Anxiety is an important trigger for AF recur­
rence after cardioversion and ablation therapy.562
Women report higher levels of anxiety (general and ICD-related), 
and higher levels of body image concerns than men when having an 
ICD.563 They also express worries about damaging the ICD during 
breast cancer screening, which in addition may compromise the quality 
of mammography images.564
In a prospective observational study of OHCA survivors, females re­
ported significantly higher symptoms of anxiety and PTSD compared 
with men, with younger women showing the highest symptom severity. 
No sex differences were observed for depression.178 In a cohort of 249 
people with ICD,565 most had relatively low distress scores at baseline 
(mean anxiety 4.23 ± 4.47; mean depression 5.60 ± 4.73). However, 
those who received a shock showed a worsening of PTSD symptom se­
verity scores at 3 months (11%), 6 months (7%), and 12 months (7%).
8.1.7. Mental health conditions associated with 
peri-partum cardiomyopathy
Peri-partum cardiomyopathy is a serious condition with significant con­
sequences for both mother and child, causing substantial psychological 
and social stress. Mental health conditions, including peri-natal psychi­
atric illness such as major depression, panic disorder, and PTSD, can 
worsen prognosis. Screening, diagnosis, and multidisciplinary manage­
ment of peri-partum cardiomyopathy-associated mental conditions 
are described in a recent dedicated ESC Heart Failure Association sci­
entific statement.566
8.2. Mental and cardiovascular health in 
older adults
Countries across the globe are experiencing an exponential rise in the 
proportion of older persons (often defined as aged 60 years or more) in 
their population, such that the WHO predicts the number of people 
aged 80 years or older will triple between 2020 and 2050.567 With age­
ing populations comes a growing burden of chronic condition manage­
ment due in part to ‘inflammageing’, whereby chronically raised blood 
inflammatory markers increase the risk of morbidity, disability, frailty, 
and early mortality.568,569 According to the Global Burden of Disease 
programme, both CVD and mental health disorders are on the 
rise.570,571 In older adults, the prevalence of depression (19.2%), anxiety 
(16.5%), and stress (13.9%) are already relatively high.572 However, 
specific mental health disorders like late-life depression are set to in­
crease,573 which has implications for CVD management. A recent sys­
tematic review and meta-analysis of 61 prospective cohort studies 
(198 589 older adults) found that late-life depression is associated 
with increased risk of CV mortality (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20–1.43).574
Whilst there is reasonable population-level data on individual condi­
tions, the rates of mental health disorders within older adults with any 
type CVD and vice versa are not well known. Using HF as an exemplar, 
which is mostly a disease of older adults, it would seem that the global 
co-occurrence of CVD with mental disorders like depression is signifi­
cant. One of the largest meta-analyses to date (149 studies, n = 305  
407, mean age 65.2 ± 7.1 years) determined that the prevalence of 
any severity depression in HF was 41.9%, and severe depression was 
28.1%.575 In older adults with AF, a meta-analysis of 26 studies deter­
mined the rate of depression as 40.3% and anxiety as 33.6%.576 Such 
results suggest that the rates of depression may be significantly higher 
in older adults with co-existing CVD, compared with the previously de­
scribed population norms for older adults (19.2% depression, 16.5% 
anxiety).572
Non-pharmacological therapies: given that suboptimal mental 
and CV health are common in older adults, it is necessary to develop 
interventions that work synergistically to improve outcomes in both 
conditions. Unfortunately, very few interventions have been trialled 
and thus clinical practice evidence is limited. One narrative review of in­
tegrated physical-mental healthcare services for older people living with 
mental health diagnoses (9 studies, n = 1728) determined that such in­
terventions improved a range of health outcomes, however, studies 
were not large nor robust.577 The majority of RCTs included in the 
Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of psychological inter­
ventions discussed in Section 6, included older adults with comorbid 
CVD and mental disorders based on sample age (14 of 21 trials included 
adults ≥60 years, age range 56 to 71 years). This review suggests that 
multicomponent psychological interventions such as CBT, MotInt, 
and mindfulness can improve anxiety and depression in this population, 
however, it did not improve MACE.263 A Cochrane review of social 
network or social support interventions, both of which are postulated 
to be useful in CVD and mental health conditions, reported that in pre­
dominantly older patients with CVD (median age 62.5 years) and co­
morbidity (including concurrent anxiety and depression), there were 
no effects on CVD and psychological well-being outcomes.578
Pharmacological therapy: managing pharmacological treatments 
in elderly patients with both mental health disorders and CVD requires 
careful consideration of dose adjustments and potential drug interac­
tions due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmaco­
dynamics. Ageing affects drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion. Reduced hepatic and renal function can alter drug clear­
ance, necessitating dose adjustments. For instance, lower doses of ben­
zodiazepines, antidepressants, and antipsychotics are often required due 
to increased sensitivity and risk of adverse effects.579 Individualized care, 
considering the patient’s overall health status, comorbidities, and 
personal health goals is needed. Selecting safer drug alternatives, 
adjusting doses, and vigilant monitoring for adverse effects and interac­
tions while balancing efficacy and safety is advisable. Guidance on poten­
tial toxicity and interactions per drug class is further discussed in Section 6. 
A summary focusing specifically on the elderly population follows. 
SSRIs and SNRIs are generally the preferred antidepressants due to 
their favourable side effect profiles. ECG monitoring may be needed, 
especially when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs such as 
antiarrhythmics. The combination of antipsychotics and antiarrhythmic 
drugs or other QT-prolonging agents requires careful monitoring.


<!-- PAGE 45 -->

### Page 45

Additionally, antipsychotics metabolized by the CYP system can interact 
with CV drugs like beta-blockers and statins, necessitating dose adjust­
ments.580,581 Lithium can cause arrhythmias, so it requires regular mon­
itoring of serum levels and renal function. It can interact with diuretics 
and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, increasing the risk of lith­
ium toxicity.582 Benzodiazepines can cause sedation and respiratory de­
pression, especially when combined with other central nervous system 
depressants.579,582,583
Polypharmacy is highly prevalent in elderly patients, increasing the 
risk of drug interactions. For example, combining central nervous sys­
tem depressants with CV drugs can lead to additive effects, such as in­
creased sedation or hypotension. Regular medication reviews and 
deprescribing where appropriate are essential to minimize these 
risks.584 Specific interactions with CV drugs need to be specially as­
sessed. For example, antipsychotics can increase the risk of QT pro­
longation, arrhythmias, or hypotension when combined with 
beta-blockers or antiarrhythmics.580,583 Antipsychotics can increase 
the risk of myalgia, myopathy, or creatine kinase elevation in combin­
ation with statins.580
8.3. Mental health and cardiovascular 
disease in people with frailty and 
multimorbidity
8.3.1. Mental health and frailty
Frailty is a state of diminished physiologic reserve and increased vulner­
ability to adverse health outcomes.585 It is a potentially reversible dy­
namic state fluctuating over time in response to stressors and 
interventions. Its incidence increases with age and overlaps with multi­
morbidity.585,586 Cardiovascular disease and frailty arise from similar 
causal mechanisms, and each increases the risk of the other condi­
tion.569 Frailty has been found to affect 40%–80% of people with 
HF,587 and to have a pooled prevalence of 19% among individuals 
with IHD.588 The substantial prevalence of frailty among older adults 
with CVD and associated risks for adverse events such as falls necessi­
tate increased awareness and evaluation by clinicians.589
Most brief screening tools used clinically to assess frailty focus on bio­
medical domains, rather than including a more holistic approach. 
Comprehensive geriatric assessments are advised in older adults to as­
sess multiple domains including psychological and socio-environmental 
contributors to frailty.585 Depression, anxiety, and frailty are associated 
with each other as seen in both observational and Mendelian random­
ization studies, with a bidirectional relationship found between depres­
sion and frailty.590,591 An analysis of 444 094 participants (median 
follow-up 7.8 years) determined that frailty resulted in over three times 
the risk for depression and twice the risk for anxiety in adjusted 
analyses.592
8.3.2. Mental health, cardiovascular disease, and 
multimorbidity
Multimorbidity is defined as the presence of two or more chronic con­
ditions in one person.593 It is estimated to affect ∼40% of the world’s 
population,594 and incidence is predicted to rise in parallel with gains 
in life expectancy and trends in global population ageing.595 At the 
societal level, multimorbidity is associated with significant healthcare 
use,595 and related utilization costs.596 At the individual level, it results 
in loss of agency and isolation,597,598 which in turn can lead to vulner­
ability, frailty, and a need for social care.599 When interrogated by dis­
ease or disease clusters in population studies,600 and systematic 
review,601 people with multimorbidity appear to have a high burden 
of concurrent CVD and mental health disorders like depression. 
However, there is no consensus across multimorbidity cluster studies 
and results are dependent upon the measure and/or threshold used 
to define multimorbidity.602
The growing burden of multimorbidity and its complexity necessi­
tates collaborative management. Given that CVD and mental health dis­
orders are frequently highlighted as important contributors to 
multimorbidity, it is reasonable that clinicians working in these fields 
can and should drive improvements in care. Degenerative neurological 
diseases should be considered as part of the multimorbidity assessment, 
but this particular aspect is out of the scope of this document. Within 
the secondary care setting, the evidence presented in Section 6.6 is rele­
vant to the management of multimorbidity, and the implementation of 
the Psycho-Cardio team would likely drive improvements in care and 
outcomes. However, there is an absence of empirical research con­
ducted in the secondary care setting and trials of bespoke multimorbid­
ity management models are urgently needed. Within the primary care 
setting, there have been mixed results in RCTs of integrated care mod­
els. The largest trial to date (3D: Dimensions of health, Depression, and 
Drugs) which was conducted on older adults (mean age 71 years) failed 
to meet its primary or secondary endpoints.603 A Cochrane review and 
meta-analysis of interventions designed to improve outcomes in pa­
tients with multimorbidity in the primary care or community setting 
(18 RCTs) reported that there was evidence that such interventions 
improved mental health outcomes, but there was no or very little im­
pact on clinical, functional, and healthcare use outcomes.604 Overall, the 
evidence suggests these interventions are effective for improving men­
tal health outcomes, however, further research is required to identify 
interventions that have dual effects (i.e. improve mental health and 
CVD outcomes).
8.3.3. Summary of evidence in older adults with 
cardiovascular disease and mental disorders
The older adult is at increased risk for the associated conditions of 
CVD, mental health conditions, multimorbidity, and frailty. These 
conditions along with polypharmacy increase the complexity of 
management and require expertise from the Psycho-Cardio team. 
Comprehensive geriatric assessment can highlight important issues 
and ensure that psychosocial domains are identified and addressed. 
The evidence for non-pharmacological interventions and integrated 
care models in older adults with CVD and mental disorders is het­
erogeneous. However, based on the current evidence these inter­
ventions appear to be effective in improving mental health 
outcomes, although they are less likely to significantly improve 
CVD outcomes. A summary of the core issues in the management 
of older adults with CVD, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy is pre­
sented in Figure 16.

8.4. Mental health and cardiovascular 
disease in socioeconomically deprived 
populations
Individuals facing economic difficulties often experience increased 
stress, reduced access to healthcare, and limited opportunities for 
social engagement.605 The role of psychosocial stress, its determi­
nants, and impact on mental health and CV risk have been presented 
in Section 4. Psychological stressors linked to socioeconomic depriv­
ation can exacerbate the risk and progression of CV condi­
tions.606,607 Concerns about financial or housing stability and other 
basic needs may amplify hormone stress responses, potentially accel­
erating CVD progression while increasing the vulnerability to mental 
health conditions like depression and anxiety.608 Lower SES often 
correlates with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, further exacerbating 
CVD risk. Research has consistently demonstrated that CVD and 
HF are significantly more prevalent among individuals with low SES, 
with disparities more pronounced in marginalized communities, 
where structural inequalities amplify the impact of socioeconomic 
deprivation on health outcomes.607,609 Socioeconomic deprivation 
status seems to be an important covariate in CV risk estimation mod­
els while risk scores that exclude socioeconomic deprivation under- 
and overestimate risk in the most and least deprived individuals, 
respectively.606
Mental health conditions following CVD events are more common in 
individuals with lower SES. Mental health service utilization following an 
MI is more frequent among men and women living in areas with high 
ethnic concentration and material deprivation.610 Several factors have 
been postulated as potential mechanisms linking lower SES and higher 
risk of mental health conditions and CVD (Figure 17).
Health inequities are also more frequent among populations such as 
the homeless, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, 
and imprisoned individuals with the impact of exclusion being greater 
in females than in males.611 While addressing socioeconomic depriv­
ation is beyond the scope of practice, it is reasonable for healthcare 
professionals to:

• Recognize that people facing socioeconomic deprivation may have in­
creased risk of CVD and mental health conditions and may struggle 
to make healthy lifestyle changes.
• Tailor lifestyle advice and behaviour change strategies to the specific 
challenges of individuals living in deprived areas.
• Support policies and governmental action that ensure equitable ac­
cess to physical and mental healthcare, healthy food, exercise, and 
safe places for walking.
• Advocate for efforts to reduce environmental pollution.
8.4.1. Mental health and cardiovascular disease in 
migrants and refugees
Minority populations are often subject to discrimination, socioeconom­
ic disadvantage, and inequity of access to optimal clinical care.612,613
Migrants and refugees, as vulnerable groups, are at increased risk 
of mental health conditions and disorders, often with greater preva­
lence of CV risk factors and socioeconomic deprivation.614 Migrants 
in particular experience higher rates of CVD morbidity and mortality 
than host populations.615 War refugees are also at higher risk for 
CVD and mental health conditions, especially PTSD, though they pre­
sent lower risk of suicide.613 Additionally, migrants and refugees often 
encounter language and cultural barriers, making engagement with 
community leaders essential for improving communication in cross- 
cultural consultations in healthcare.616 While stakeholders’ involve­
ment can reduce healthcare barriers, structural factors may limit 
the scope and sustainability of these improvements in practice.617
Mental health challenges in migrant populations are illustrated in 
Figure 18.
Healthcare professionals can support migrant groups with CVD and 
mental health conditions by: 
• Adopting culturally sensitive approaches.
• Collaborating with community stakeholders.
• Tailoring community-based strategies to different ethnic groups.
8.4.2. Barriers to mental healthcare access
Socioeconomic deprivation creates significant barriers to accessing 
both mental healthcare and CV care for individuals with CVD, worsen­
ing the challenges faced by this vulnerable group. Financial constraints, 
lack of insurance coverage, and transportation difficulties are major ob­
stacles, with stigma surrounding mental health further exacerbating the 
problem. Despite high rates of depression and anxiety in this popula­
tion, the utilization of mental health services remains low due to these 
barriers.606,618–624
Comprehensive strategies are needed to overcome these barriers 
and ensure equitable access to healthcare, including subsidizing mental 
health services, expanding insurance coverage, integrating mental 
healthcare into primary care settings, and investing in telehealth. High 
costs of therapy, medication, and other interventions can be prohibi­
tive, deterring people with CVD from seeking needed care, with the fi­
nancial burden of CVD care further limiting resources for mental health 
support.619

Additionally, the lack of comprehensive health insurance coverage is a 
significant issue, with many socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals 
unable to afford out-of-pocket mental health services. This further per­
petuates disparities in access to necessary mental healthcare.620
Addressing these challenges through enhanced service provision and 
support is essential for improving mental health outcomes in people 
with CVD from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds.
8.4.3. Stigma in healthcare provision
Mental health-related stigma is a major barrier to accessing healthcare, op­
erating at three interconnected levels: structural, interpersonal, and intra­
personal.625 Structural discrimination is reflected in the disparity between 
physical and mental healthcare provision, resulting in limited and poor- 
quality mental health services.626 Interpersonal stigma involves problems 
of knowledge (ignorance), attitudes (prejudice), and behaviour (discrimin­
ation). Intrapersonal mental health stigma, or self-stigma, reduces help- 
seeking behaviour and further contributes to health disparities.627
Stigma affects all populations across different socioeconomic strata, 
contributing to mental health disparities. Effective interventions to re­
duce stigma include social contact with individuals with mental health 
disorders and personal relationships, such as with friends or family 
members. Educational interventions, especially for general healthcare 
professionals with little or no formal mental health training, have shown 
promise in decreasing stigma.626 However, there is a significant re­
search gap regarding effective interventions to prevent and combat 
structural and interpersonal stigma. Enhancing education to include 
training on mental health and stigma for healthcare professionals could 
be crucial in addressing these issues.
8.4.4. Community and policy interventions
Community-level and policy interventions are essential to reduce the 
adverse impact of socioeconomic deprivation on mental health in indi­
viduals with and without CVD.607,628,629 Initiatives addressing dispar­
ities include:

(cardio-oncology)
8.5.1. Mental health in people with cancer and 
cardiovascular disease
Chronic stress may contribute to cancer development.638 Cancer diag­
nosis and treatment initiation may cause or intensify psychological dis­
tress,639 leading to an increased risk of major CV events (HF, 
ischaemic stroke, ACS, AF), with the highest incidence appearing 6–12 
months after cancer diagnosis.640–642 People with a new diagnosis of can­
cer experience significant stress and anxiety associated with an uncertain 
prognosis, which may even trigger suicidal ideations. In prostate cancer, 
the risk of CV death was increased during the first month after diagnosis 
(∼two-fold) and highest in people with metastatic cancer (∼three- 
fold).642 New CV symptoms (e.g. venous thrombosis, pulmonary embol­
ism, stroke, MI, TTS, arrhythmia) may appear with cancer,643 suggesting 
common underlying factors, such as chronic inflammation and thrombo­
embolic disorders. However, the importance of stress may be crucial.
Takotsubo syndrome in people living with cancer is a notable ex­
ample of a role of stress and anxiety in cardio-oncology.644–647 Three 
of the most important independent prognostic predictors of mortality 
in people with TTS include cancer history (HR 2.004; P = .004), physical 
stress as a trigger (HR 1.882; P = .012), and history of depression (HR 
1.622; P = .009).648 Takotsubo syndrome in people with prior in­
trathoracic malignancies and radiation therapy carries a higher risk of 
cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, stroke, respiratory fail­
ure, and all-cause mortality.649
People with cancer and concomitant CVD may fear that their CVD will 
delay or prevent optimal cancer treatment. Cardio-oncology programmes 
aim to prevent such issues by ensuring proper CV management allowing 
optimal oncology therapy and providing a supportive network throughout 
the treatment phase.650 Psychologists, as an integral part of the 
cardio-oncology team, are essential to help people to cope with the psy­
chological consequences of the disease and treatment. Physiotherapists 
and dietitians also play vital roles in empowerment and reassurance.
8.5.2. Cancer survivors
After radical anticancer treatment, where a good long-term prognosis 
is expected, stress may be related to the fear of cancer recurrence,651
or depression related to the complications of cancer or its treat­
ment.652 Among childhood cancer survivors, stress/distress was asso­
ciated with new-onset dysrhythmia (RR 2.87), perceived stress with 
hypertension (RR 1.42), PTSS and anxiety with dyslipidaemia (RR 
1.72 and 1.54, respectively).653 A significant relationship between se­
vere psychological distress and CVD in cancer survivors was observed 
(OR 2.95), especially in younger females.654
8.5.3. Advanced cancer disease
Awareness of cancer progression can lead to depression, which may be 
worsened by cancer treatment-related toxicity.655 Cancer progression, 
fatigue, and therapy-related toxicity (haematological, endocrinological, 
neurological and particularly, cardiological) contribute to feelings of dis­
couragement and depression.656 One in four people with advanced 
cancer, HF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or human im­
munodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome may ex­
perience mental health issues, including depression, alcohol abuse, 
PTSD, or anxiety disorders.657 Such conditions often coexist and 
may be observed in cardio-oncology.
8.5.4. Cancer therapy-related cardiovascular 
toxicity
People with pre-existing CVD are more sensitive to cancer therapy-related 
CV toxicity including CV dysfunction; however, stressors like anxiety can 
be an additional trigger.658 People with breast cancer who experienced 
cancer therapy-related CV dysfunction reported significant declines in 
physical, social, and psychosocial well-being, including overwhelming fatigue, 
mental burden of anxiety (fear of death, depression, stress, poor sleep qual­
ity), and social challenges (lack of understanding and acceptance).659 Heart 
failure in breast cancer survivors is particularly linked to serious mental 
well-being deficits, especially in the early stages.660 This underscores the 
need for multidisciplinary cardio-oncological care models.659
8.5.5. Impact of cancer therapy on mental health
People in the cardio-oncology setting may experience neurotoxicity, in­
cluding chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction (‘chemobrain’), 
particularly with cardiotoxic therapies, which correlates with increased 
fatigue and psychological distress.661 Potentially cardiotoxic cancer 
treatments with possible cognitive impairment include: chemotherapy 
(doxorubicin, paclitaxel, methotrexate, fluorouracil), hormone therap­
ies (aromatase inhibitors, anti-oestrogen, androgen deprivation ther­
apy), targeted therapies (antiangiogenic therapy), and immunotherapy 
(anti-CTLA-4, anti-PDL-1).662
Androgen deprivation therapy, a primary treatment for prostate can­
cer, is associated with a higher risk of depression and psychiatric outpatient 
visits.663 Endocrine therapy for breast cancer may cause mood disor­
ders,664 sleep problems,665 cognitive decline,666 fear of cancer recur­
rence,667 emotional distress, and concern about appearance.668 Severe 
fear of cancer recurrence was associated with a higher risk of depression 
and lower QoL in breast cancer survivors.669
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy significantly decreases 
QoL and impacts on mental health. Older (cisplatin and vinca alkaloids) 
and newer (taxanes, oxaliplatin) anticancer agents can be responsible for 
these neurological side effects. Oncology expert documents recommend 
antidepressants (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine),670 but these should be cho­
sen following consideration of CVD risk (e.g. HF or arrhythmias/QTc pro­
longation). Radiation, while essential in many cancer treatments, can 
induce CV toxicity671 and significant mental health issues.672 The 
Ontario Cancer Registry showed mental health conditions (anxiety, de­
pression, and low well-being) were associated with higher comorbidity 
burden during radiation.673
8.5.6. Psychological interventions
One of the roles of cardio-oncology is to minimize the barriers to onco­
logical treatment related to a person’s CVD. Providing simultaneous 
cardiology care can improve the psychological well-being of people 
dealing with both cancer and CVD. Cardio-oncologists should identify

psychosocial distress, including depression, anxiety, anger, social 
isolation, marital/family distress, sexual dysfunction, and substance 
abuse. People in the cardio-oncology setting may benefit from multi­
disciplinary team discussions, involving CV specialists, oncologists, and 
mental health professionals. Alternatively, they should be referred to 
mental health specialists, who can collaborate with the primary 
cardio-oncology team to support comprehensive care.674
8.5.7. Lifestyle interventions in cardio-oncology
A comprehensive approach is necessary in cardio-oncology, as both CV 
health and mental health should be monitored during and after cancer 
therapy. The essence of a cardio-oncology clinic resides in the availabil­
ity of a doctor to address symptoms related to CV toxicity from 
oncological treatment or potential cancer relapse/progression, which 
may coexist.675 The benefits in cardio-oncology include recommending 
physical activity: 
• Cancer survivors with CVD: an exercise-based programme can im­
prove cardiorespiratory fitness and survival;676 ECR can improve de­
pression scores in breast cancer survivors.677
• In people with advanced or metastatic cancer,678 exercise interven­
tions can lower mortality, and improve psychosocial function and 
sleep quality.679
• Women with breast cancer receiving potentially cardiotoxic therap­
ies may improve their mental health by a comprehensive CV risk re­
duction programme.680

8.5.8. Medical interventions (including 
pharmacological therapies)
There are no specific recommendations or evidence for the efficacy of 
psychiatric drugs in cardio-oncology. However, data from general car­
diology and oncology can be extrapolated and implemented with care­
ful consideration of specific requirements of people with cancer and 
CVD.
The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias increases in people with 
advanced cancer,681 with the risk compounded by coexisting heart 
disease.682 Psychiatric drugs (antipsychotics, antidepressants), CV 
drugs (especially antiarrhythmics), and oncological drugs may interact, 
leading to QTc prolongation, and increased bleeding risk.683
Therefore, it is important to avoid significant drug–drug interactions 
to minimize side effects and prevent reduced effectiveness of cancer 
treatments due to altered plasma concentrations.680,683 There are 
potential positive indirect effects on mental health resulting from 
CV therapies: 
• Treating cancer therapy-related CV dysfunction and cancer-related 
anaemia may decrease shortness of breath, easing anxiety and 
distress.684
• Treatment of tachycardia/tachyarrhythmia or autonomic dysfunction 
due to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or cancer, may improve psycho­
logical symptoms.685–687
On the other hand, reducing anxiety and stress may lower blood 
pressure and help control hypertension in people living with cancer. 
A summary of the major management steps of mental health in 
cardio-oncology and the main management approaches is shown in 
Figure 19.
8.6. Section summary points and 
management consensus statements from 
Section 8
9. Key messages
(i) The interplay between mental and CV health should be known 
and acknowledged in order to provide a holistic and integrated 
care.
(ii) Healthcare professionals should aspire to implement an inte­
grated Psycho-Cardio team approach that is tailored to the local 
needs.
(iii) The ACTIVE principles (Acknowledge, Check, Tools, Implement, 
Venture, Evaluate) can be used as a practical approach to imple­
ment integrated mental healthcare into CV practice.
(iv) Screening for mental health conditions (mainly anxiety, depres­
sion, and PTSD) and psychosocial risk factors could help improve 
CV risk assessment in healthy individuals.
(v) Screening for mental health conditions in people with CVD is im­
portant since these are highly prevalent and associated with 
worse outcomes.
(vi) Initial screening may be performed with a two-item measure, 
followed by longer validated tools if it raises mental health 
concerns.
(vii) A stepped care approach for mental health in CVD is advisable: 
intensity of mental care should be tailored to individual need.
(viii) There is low to moderate certainty evidence that psychological in­
terventions have an effect on depression, anxiety, and QoL in 
people with CVD. The evidence is weaker or non-existent for a 
reduction in MACE and mortality.
(ix) Pharmacological treatment with anxiolytics or antidepressants in 
people with CVD and mental health conditions should be balanced 
against risks, considering drug–drug interactions and side effects.
(x) Caregivers of people with CVD, who play a key role in well-being 
and treatment adherence, often face mental health challenges 
themselves, highlighting the need for strategies to assess and sup­
port their mental health.
(xi) People with SMI have a worse CV outcome. Efforts should be 
made to reduce stigma and provide optimal Guideline-directed 
CV care, with special attention to treatment adherence and clin­
ically relevant drug–drug interactions.
(xii) Specific characteristics (sex, gender, age, frailty, SES, comorbid­
ities, co-medications) should be carefully assessed as they are 
modifiers of the interaction between CVD and mental health 
and may merit individualized approaches.
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
Depression, anxiety, and chronic stress show higher prevalence in 
women compared with men and are associated with increased 
CVD risk.
(ii)
Women with CVD exhibit higher rates of mental health conditions, 
which are associated with worse outcomes, particularly depression.
(iii)
Sex differences in the multidirectional relationship between CV and 
mental health suggest a role of biological and sociocultural 
components (gender).
(iv)
Evaluation of mental health and frailty in elderly people with CVD is 
of utmost importance,
(v)
Socioeconomically deprived populations show higher rates of CVD 
and mental disorders and require special attention.
(vi)
Cancer, CVD, and mental disorders exhibit significant three-way 
relationships with shared risk factors.

MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Psycho-Cardio teams may need to tailor their intervention to the 
specificities of the target population, with special attention to sex 
differences, age, frailty, and SES.
(ii)
The appropriateness of antidepressants, drug interactions and side 
effects in the multimorbid, elderly, and frail need careful evaluation 
by a multidisciplinary team.
(iii)
Migrants and refugees may benefit from directed proactive 
programmes to assess their CV and mental health due to the high 
prevalence of conditions and their potential difficulties to access the 
healthcare system.

### 10 Gaps in knowledge

There are substantial gaps in the knowledge of the multidirectional re­
lationship between mental health, CV health, and CVD, and its mechan­
isms. Further, optimal strategies to identify, prevent, and manage 
mental health conditions in people with CVD are lacking. These gaps 
not only include finding effective interventions to prevent and manage 
mental health conditions and ways to implement them, but also ways to 
change the system to provide integrative healthcare including mental 
and physical health. A summary of the main gaps across the broad do­
mains covered in this document are outlined below.
10.1. Knowledge gaps in relation to 
prevention and screening
• There is a lack of evidence-based, cost-effective, and tailored inter­
ventions to improve psychosocial factors, mental health conditions, 
and mental well-being as preventive measures for CVD.
• Determination of optimal screening protocols, including timing, fre­
quency, and methods, for mental health conditions in people with 
CVD, and how these might vary by condition have not been established.
• Screening-based treatment algorithms are not defined.
• Data on the cost-effectiveness of interventions to identify, prevent, 
or treat mental health conditions in people with CVD are lacking.
10.2. Knowledge gaps in relation to clinical 
management
• Feasibility, effectiveness, and sustainability of long-term non- 
pharmacological interventions, such as physical activity, psychother­
apy, and social prescribing need to be established.
• Evaluation of specific psychological interventions and their delivery 
methods, including digital health solutions, is needed.
• Effective behavioural strategies for achieving behaviour change and 
improving CV risk profiles among people with mental disorders, in­
cluding SMI, need to be developed and tested.
• Understanding of the role of trauma-specific prevention or treat­
ments for CVD-related PTSD is lacking.
• Research into the mental health impact of caregiving for people with 
CVD, prevention of its negative consequences, and integration of in­
terventions into routine CV care is needed.
• Pharmacological research is needed to: 
⚬Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of antidepressants and anti­
psychotics in people with HF and their effects on CV clinical 
outcomes.
⚬Explore the role of pharmacogenomics in stratifying treatment to 
minimize CV adverse effects and enhance psychiatric treatment 
efficacy.
⚬Investigate the efficacy of psychiatric drugs in cardio-oncology.
10.3. Knowledge gaps in relation to special 
populations
• Cardiovascular risk scores for people with SMI need to be recalibrated.
• Randomized controlled trials of interventions for elderly people with 
comorbid CVD and mental health conditions are needed.
• The efficacy of multidisciplinary approaches in improving outcomes 
for people with multimorbidity requires further research. 
10.4. Knowledge gaps in relation to 
healthcare systems and healthcare delivery
• Development and testing of integrated or collaborative care models 
for people with coexisting CV and mental health conditions is 
needed.
• Care pathways to streamline the management of people with 
CVD and mental health conditions need to be developed and 
evaluated.
• Evaluation of community-level and policy interventions to address 
socioeconomic disparities impacting CV and mental health is 
essential.
11. Conclusions
This document provides a comprehensive review of the evidence of the 
critical interplay between mental and CV health and disease, emphasiz­
ing the need to integrate mental health assessment and management 
into routine CV care. However, the consistency of definitions, mechan­
isms of interactions, and optimal ways to investigate, prevent, or treat 
the negative impact of mental health on CVD and vice versa need fur­
ther research.
Social and clinical efforts are needed to fight the stigma of mental 
health conditions in the population and in healthcare systems to reduce 
its impact on CV care. This is particularly urgent for people with SMI, in 
whom an extra effort is needed to reduce the major gaps in CV preven­
tion, acute and chronic CV care. Awareness campaigns and educational 
programmes for CV care professionals, people with CVD, their care­
givers and decision-makers will be needed.
Integrated CV care models with a holistic view of health need to be 
co-developed in hospital and outpatient CV care units, integrating and co- 
ordinating with mental health professionals, primary care and social care. 
These should be co-designed together with people with lived experience 
of CVD and their caregivers, and adapted to the local conditions and 
availability, individual characteristics and needs. Comprehensive ECR pro­
grammes are good examples of care integration. Educational modules 
and specific training programmes designed by medical and nursing staff 
and allied health professionals, particularly mental health professionals, 
are warranted. Reimbursement models for the new models of care 
need to be addressed and implemented by local authorities.
Future research is needed to increase the knowledge of the multi­
lateral interactions between mental health and CV health and obtain 
solid evidence for the prevention and management of the negative 
consequences of these interactions. This should include prospective 
longitudinal studies in the population, in people with different CVDs, 
and in people with mental health conditions, including those with 
SMI. There is an urgent need for RCTs, with larger and more diverse 
samples of individuals and types of CVD that test the effectiveness 
and safety of medical and non-medical interventions. These trials 
should include psychological, pharmacological, social, and other types 
of interventions to prevent or reduce negative mental and CV 
outcomes.

Disclaimer: The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines represent the views of the ESC and were produced after careful 
consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their publication. The ESC is not responsible in 
the event of any contradiction, discrepancy and/or ambiguity between the ESC Guidelines and any other official recommendations or guidelines 
issued by the relevant public health authorities, in particular in relation to good use of healthcare or therapeutic strategies. Health professionals 
are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well as in the determination and the 
implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies; however, the ESC Guidelines do not override, in any way 
whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s 
health condition and in consultation with that patient and, where appropriate and/or necessary, the patient’s caregiver. Nor do the ESC 
Guidelines exempt health professionals from taking into full and careful consideration the relevant official updated recommendations or 
guidelines issued by the competent public health authorities, in order to manage each patient’s case in light of the scientifically accepted data 
pursuant to their respective ethical and professional obligations. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the applicable rules and 
regulations relating to drugs and medical devices prior to making any clinical decision and to check whether a more recent version of this 
document exists. The ESC warns readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect.

1. Preamble 
Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of assisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic 
approach for an individual patient with a given condition. ESC Guidelines 
are intended for use by health professionals but do not override their individual responsibility to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with the 
patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is 
also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription and to respect the ethical rules of their profession. 
ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given 
topic. Guideline topics are selected for updating after annual expert review of new evidence conducted by the ESC Clinical Practice 
Guidelines (CPG) Committee. ESC Policies and Procedures for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website 
(https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/ 
Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines). 
This guideline updates and replaces the previous version of the ESC 
Guidelines on pericarditis from 2015. For the first time it also covers 
myocarditis. This Task Force was selected by the ESC to include professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology 
and to include patient representatives and methodologists. The selection procedure included an open call for authors and aimed to include 
members from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant 
ESC Subspecialty Communities. Consideration was given to diversity 
and inclusion. 
Guidelines Task Forces perform a critical review and evaluation of 
the published literature on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Recommendations are 
based on major randomized trials and relevant systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses, when available. Systematic literature searches are 
conducted in cases of controversy or uncertainty to ensure that all 
key studies were considered. For recommendations related to diagnosis and prognosis, additional types of evidence are included, such as 
diagnostic accuracy studies and studies focused on the development 
and validation of prognostic models. The strength of each recommendation and the level of evidence supporting it are weighed and scored 
according to predefined criteria as outlined in Tables 1 and 2. 
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported 
experience measures (PREMs) are also evaluated when available as 
the basis for recommendations and/or discussion in these guidelines. 
Evidence tables summarizing key information from relevant studies 
are generated to facilitate the formulation of recommendations, to enhance comprehension of recommendations after publication, and to 
reinforce transparency in the guidelines development process. The tables are published in their own section of ESC Guidelines and reference 
specific recommendation tables. 
After an iterative process of deliberations, a first Task Force vote 
on all recommendations is conducted prior to the initiation of rounds 
of review. A second Task Force vote on all recommendations is conducted after the final round of review and revision. For each vote, the 
Task Force follows ESC voting procedures and all recommendations 
require at least 75% agreement among voting members to be approved. Voting restrictions may be applied based on declarations of 
interests.

The writing and reviewing panels provide declaration of interest 
forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential 
sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest are reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules, which can 
be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/doi) and are 
compiled in a report published in a supplementary document with 
the guidelines. Funding for the development of ESC Guidelines is derived entirely from the ESC with no involvement of the healthcare 
industry. 
The CPG Committee supervises and co-ordinates the preparation of 
new guidelines and approves their publication. In addition to review by 
the CPG Committee, ESC Guidelines undergo multiple rounds of 
double-blind peer review on a dedicated online review platform. The 
review is conducted by topic experts, including members from ESC 
National Cardiac Societies and from relevant ESC Subspecialty 
Communities. Guideline Task Forces consider all review comments 
and are required to respond to all those classified as major. After appropriate revisions, the Task Force and the CPG Committee members 
approve the final document for publication in the European Heart 
Journal. 
Unless otherwise stated, ESC Guidelines content refers to sex, 
understood as the biological condition of being male or female, defined 
by genes, hormones and sexual organs. Off-label use of medication may 
be presented in this guideline if a sufficient level of evidence shows that 
it can be considered medically appropriate for a given condition. 
However, decisions on off-label use must be made by the responsible 
health professional giving special consideration to ethical rules concerning healthcare, the specific situation of the patient, patient consent, and 
country-specific health regulations. 
2. Introduction 
Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory diseases of the myocardium and pericardium, respectively, with potential overlap. These are 
the first ESC clinical practice guidelines covering the whole spectrum 
of these diseases. 
Herein, the Task Force (TF) introduces the term ‘inflammatory myopericardial syndrome’ (IMPS). IMPS is an umbrella term during the initial 
diagnostic process until a final diagnosis is made (Figure 1). It reflects the 
possible myocarditis–pericarditis overlap, aiming to increase the awareness of the spectrum of disease, and to allow timely diagnosis and better 
management. IMPS ranges from isolated myocarditis to isolated pericarditis through mixed forms with possible reciprocal involvement, such as 
myopericarditis and perimyocarditis. Both terms are commonly used in 
the medical literature, and defined in the 2015 ESC Guidelines for the 
diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases (see Section 8).1 
The rationale for the introduction of IMPS is that myocarditis and 
pericarditis have similar aetiologies and are anatomical contiguous 
structures with possible secondary involvement.2–5 
The field has experienced rapid growth, with position statements 
proposed by different cardiac societies.6–10 In the past, several consensus statements were provided, usually defining a proven myocarditis 
based on endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Endomyocardial biopsy is 
able to detect the histological type, can identify some specific aetiologies, and can help to differentiate from non-inflammatory cardiomyopathies (CMPs).10 But nowadays multimodality imaging has become a 
cornerstone for the diagnosis of myocardial and pericardial inflammation and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) plays a crucial 
role, as reported in other ESC guidelines11–13 (Figure 2). 
The aim of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based guidance for 
clinical management of IMPS, to guide clinicians of all subspecialties 
from a clinical point of view, and to ensure qualified shared decision- 
making with patients (see Section 13 and Supplementary data online,  
Section 8). 
2.1. What is new 
Guidelines on pericarditis have been published twice before,1,15 while 
myocarditis will be covered for the first time in a guideline. The TF believes that combined guidelines with the recognition of the spectrum of 
disease are a step in a new direction, enabling a paradigm shift towards 
therapy based on the combined input from experts in inflammatory 
diseases of the myocardium and pericardium, with the support of a 
multidisciplinary team. In order to improve the awareness of the spectrum of disease, a new category, ‘inflammatory myopericardial syndrome (IMPS)’, will be introduced as an umbrella term to increase 
the understanding of the potential myocarditis–pericarditis overlap.

It is introduced as an entering diagnostic term to lead to a tailored work- 
up and individualized therapy. Patient-oriented case management is proposed in different settings such as diagnosis and therapy, as well as return 
to work and play avoiding strict time definitions, since the remission pathway differs from patient to patient. In addition, a novelty in the field of 
IMPS is the improved knowledge on its possible genetic background 
and its link to specific inherited CMPs. Furthermore, a paradigm shift 
will be introduced in its diagnostic management. This is reflecting the 
new capabilities of multimodality imaging, especially CMR, as it has changed clinical workflow during recent years. A similar change was introduced in the American College of Cardiology (ACC) consensus 
statement in 2024.9 Endomyocardial biopsy has its place and is needed 
if specific decisions are warranted. 
In comparison with the last ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis 
and management of pericardial diseases,1 the current understanding 
of the pathogenesis of pericarditis has greatly improved with new evidence on the importance of the interplay between inflammation and 
autoinflammatory mechanisms, the role of genetic background, and 
immune responses in patients with multiple recurrences. The identification of a positive family history, a poor response to colchicine, and 
a clinical presentation with an inflammatory or non-inflammatory 
phenotype are useful tools to guide the selection of patients for genetic testing and specific pharmacological options. A new class of drugs 
targeting interleukin-1 (IL-1), the so-called anti-IL-1 agents, has become available and is used in recurrent cases with a poor response 
to other conventional therapies. Nevertheless, we need to further improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of non-inflammatory disease forms. 
Moreover, diagnostic capabilities have increased, thanks to the role 
of multimodality imaging, allowing improved diagnostic accuracy and

individualized duration of therapies according to clinical and imaging 
findings. 
The TF recommends establishing a multidisciplinary IMPS team to 
ensure optimal patient care in complicated cases. 
We firmly believe that recognizing IMPS will enhance the understanding of these inflammatory conditions and hope it will inspire further research to advance personalized diagnostic and therapeutic 
approaches. 
3. Epidemiology, classification, 
stages, diagnostic criteria and 
aetiology 
3.1. Epidemiology 
Population-based studies of the incidence or prevalence of IMPS are 
limited, and most epidemiological studies assess disease burden and 
sequelae in selected patient groups, such as those admitted to hospital. However, such studies might underestimate the true disease 
burden. For example, the rate of patients diagnosed with acute myocarditis (AM) increases from 5% to 13% with the use of CMR among 
patients with angina-like symptoms and increased high-sensitivity 
troponin T (hs-TnT).16 A different registry reported an incidence 
of 6.3–8.6 per 100 000 inhabitants, mostly in young men.17 The current global burden of cardiovascular disease data reports a prevalence of 4.2–8.7 per 100 000 in the age range between 35 and 
39 years.18 Men and younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed, although this could reflect the diagnostic bias towards these 
patient groups.19 
In children <2 years of age, the sex distribution is balanced; in adolescents there is a male prevalence (about two-thirds of cases),20,21 
which is also maintained in adult patients, suggesting the importance 
of hormonal factors. 
The incidence of acute pericarditis (AP) is estimated to be about 3– 
32 cases per 100 000 person-years.22,23 Similar to myocarditis, men and 
younger individuals are more likely to be diagnosed. Recurrence occurs 
in about 20%–30% of patients within 18 months after a first episode 
of AP.24 The recurrence rate increases up to 50% after the first recurrence.25 Pericarditis is diagnosed in 0.2% of all cardiovascular in-hospital 
admissions and is responsible for 5% of emergency room admissions for 
chest pain.23 In the observational Epidémiologie de la Douleur 
Thoracique (EPIDOULTHO) study, 3% of patients received a final diagnosis of IMPS.26 
3.2. Classification and stages 
The field of IMPS gained increasing awareness and interest during the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.27 Research in the 
field of all forms of IMPS has a long history, and several terminologies 
exist. This is also reflected in the definition of stages. We are proposing 
a terminology from a clinical point of view with the intention of guiding 
the appropriate management of patients (Table 3). In addition, time 
frames for the stages (acute, subacute, and chronic) are suggested to 
be used for myocarditis and pericarditis. However, it is not always possible from a clinical point of view to identify the disease onset, for instance in subacute cases.1 
IMPS is characterized by different stages (see Figure 3). The course of 
the disease differs among patients. A patient may recover completely 
without any residuals, but others may develop complications, in some 
cases leading to death. Patients may not experience every stage. 
Complete remission can occur at every timepoint. However, a deep 
understanding of the respective stages is essential for appropriate 
therapeutic guidance.

3.3. Diagnostic criteria 
After the original proposed diagnostic criteria from the consensus paper 
in 2013,10 multimodality imaging, in particular CMR, has made a clinical, 
non-invasive diagnosis of myocarditis feasible. In accordance with the 
paradigm change (Figure 2), the TF proposes new diagnostic criteria and 
a new classification, following the system introduced in the 2023 ESC 
Guidelines for the management of endocarditis (Table 4).29 This clinically 
driven approach is based on a clinical presentation, with additional supportive findings, and positive CMR or EMB for myocarditis. Histopathological 
criteria and updated CMR Lake Louise criteria (LLC)30 are given in  
Table 5 and Figure 4, respectively. Similarly, diagnosis of pericarditis can 
be made with a clinical presentation, and more than one additional criterion. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance can also provide the non-invasive 
confirmation of the presence of pericarditis beyond clinical criteria. 
3.3.1. Diagnostic criteria for myocarditis 
Myocarditis can be clinically diagnosed as definite/possible with an 
appropriate clinical presentation and additional criterion, including 
CMR-proven or EMB-proven result (see details in Table 4). The additional criteria include common parameters in basic work-up, such as 
an electrocardiogram (ECG), which may show unspecific changes, including the whole spectrum of presentations from mimicking a myocardial infarction with ST elevation in non-coronary distribution, as well as 
rhythm abnormalities, or findings in echocardiography (see Section 5.5). 
Laboratory analysis of serum biomarkers usually shows elevation of 
markers of myocardial lesion, such as hs-TnT or high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI). Biomarkers of heart failure (HF) (such as N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, NT-proBNP) are also needed to 
identify the severity of the disease, and suggest myocardial involvement. 
Depending on the individual case and risk (see Section 4), definitive 
diagnosis of myocarditis can be based on CMR (Figure 4) or EMB 
(Table 5). For EMB analysis quantitative immunohistochemistry criteria 
for inflammatory cells in lymphocytic myocarditis (LM) are under development. Asymptomatic cases may exist, e.g. vaccine- or drug-related 
cases, such as immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced myocarditis, 
and are often underdiagnosed.

Non-ischaemic myocardial inflammation can be diagnosed by CMR 
according to the updated LLC30 (see Figure 4). This is based on at least 
one T2-based criterion plus ideally one T1-based criterion. Having both 
a positive T2-based criterion and a T1-based criterion will increase specificity for diagnosing AM, but a diagnosis of possible myocarditis can 
still be made by having only one (i.e. T2-based or T1-based) criterion 
in an appropriate clinical scenario, although with less specificity. 
Supportive criteria include pericardial abnormalities (which, however, 
suggest concomitant pericarditis), and global or regional left ventricular 
(LV) systolic dysfunction on cine imaging.

Histopathological Dallas criteria,31 in addition to immunohistological 
staining to detect CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages, are required 
to identify specific histological subtypes of myocarditis and to differentiate from phenocopies [e.g. arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)].32,33 New quantitative criteria are presently 
required, since the ESC criteria of ≥14 leucocytes/mm2 including 
≥7 CD3+ T cells/mm2 have been questioned by cardiopathologists.10 
In addition, molecular analysis of EMB and blood [including assessment 
of viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) in peripheral leucocytes and in plasma] using quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) is necessary to identify the aetiopathogenesis of myocarditis and allow targeted therapies (antiviral or immunosuppressive/ 
immunomodulatory), if clinically useful.10,32,34 Examples are given in 
Section 5.9.1. 
3.3.2. Diagnostic criteria for pericarditis 
Pericarditis is an inflammatory pericardial syndrome with or without 
pericardial effusion (PEff). The definite clinical diagnosis can be made 
with a clinical presentation and more than one additional criterion 
(Table 4). The main presenting symptom is usually chest pain 
(85%–90% of cases), which is typically sharp and pleuritic, improves 
by sitting up and leaning forward, and is exacerbated by inspiration, 
lying down, and deglutition, due to increased attrition between inflamed pericardial layers. Dyspnoea can be reported by the elderly, 
or right HF signs and symptoms in the case of pericarditis with constriction. Arrhythmic presentations are rare and are usually associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Additional criteria include a 
pericardial friction rub (≤33% of cases), which is a superficial scratchy 
or squeaking sound, caused by friction between the two inflamed 
pericardial layers. Electrocardiogram changes have been historically 
reported as a typical hallmark of AP; however, the pericardium is 
electrically silent, so ECG changes imply concomitant inflammation 
of the myocardium, warranting investigation for concurrent myocarditis.35 On imaging, new or worsening PEff (up to 60% of cases), 
which is generally mild, might be detected. As pericarditis classically 
manifests with an inflammatory syndrome, elevated laboratory markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (79%–90%),36 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and neutrophilic leucocytosis,37,38 can provide additional supportive criteria. The inflamed 
pericardium is neovascularized and contrast-enhanced on computed 
tomography (CT) and CMR. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance is 
superior for tissue characterization and can reveal pericardial oedema and/or pericardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), providing additional imaging criteria for the diagnosis. 
3.4. Aetiology of myocarditis and 
pericarditis 
Myocardial and pericardial diseases share mostly similar aetiologies (see  
Supplementary data online, Table S1). The aetiology of IMPS can be either infectious or non-infectious. These can trigger IMPS in a genetically 
predisposed individual by inflammatory/autoimmune mechanisms. 
However, the prevalence of each aetiology and the impact of the causative agent on the clinical course, prognosis, and therapeutic approach 
may differ between the two entities.1,10 
3.4.1. Aetiology of myocarditis 
The most common infectious aetiology is presumed to be viral.10,39,40 
Enteroviruses, adenoviruses, parvovirus B19 (B19V) and some 
herpesviruses [Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6)], 
as well as influenza and coronaviruses, are the most common viruses 
associated with myocarditis (Supplementary data online, Table S1). 
Non-cytotoxic viruses trigger myocarditis indirectly by activating the immune system.41,42 Bacterial infection with Borrelia species [Lyme carditis 
(LC)] and parasitic infections, such as Trypanosoma cruzi [Chagas disease 
(CD)], are additional important aetiologies in specific regions of the globe. 
However, several non-infectious aetiologies should be recognized, 
including systemic diseases, autoimmune (or likely autoimmune) disorders [systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)], immune-mediated 
forms [such as LM, giant-cell myocarditis (GCM), eosinophilic myocarditis (EM), and cardiac sarcoidosis (CS)], inflammatory bowel disorders, drugs and toxic reactions (including ICI-associated myocarditis, 
see Section 9.6.1.1) and chest radiation, as well as genetic conditions 
such as inherited CMP (see Section 5.3);10,39 see Supplementary data 
online, Table S1.10 
3.4.2. Aetiology of pericarditis 
The aetiology largely depends on the epidemiological background, 
patient population, and clinical setting.1,10 Idiopathic or viral pericarditis is the most frequent aetiology in developed countries, 
ranging from 50% in inpatient settings to >80% in outpatient 
settings.43–48 Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for about 70% of 
all cases, especially in human immunodeficiency (HIV)-infected patients, in regions where the disease is endemic. An increasing number of cases are related to interventional procedures and surgery 
[post-cardiac injury syndrome (PCIS)] due to the increased number 
of procedures performed and the ageing population.49 Other common causes include systemic inflammatory/autoimmune diseases 
and cancer (especially lung and breast cancer or lymphomas and 
leukaemia) (see Supplementary data online, Table S1).1 
About 5%–15% of patients with recurrence have genetic mutations, 
sometimes related to a monogenic autoinflammatory disease, mainly familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and tumour necrosis factor receptor- 
associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS).50,51 A genetic predisposition 
and an autoinflammatory/immune-mediated pathogenesis are also suspected in patients with multiple recurrences. For additional information 
see Supplementary data online, Tables S2 and S3.50–52 
4. Clinical presentation of 
inflammatory myopericardial 
syndrome 
The term IMPS includes a spectrum of inflammatory diseases from 
isolated myocarditis to isolated pericarditis through a combination 
of both. IMPS should be used as an umbrella term during the initial 
diagnostic work-up until the final diagnosis is made. One of the major challenges for the diagnosis of IMPS is recognition itself, therefore the TF highlighted red flags (Table 6). These symptoms and 
signs should suggest IMPS. The red flags for IMPS are mainly clinical 
signs, accompanied by serological and/or imaging biomarkers, and 
are not equivalent to the risk. Red flags for IMPS are warning signs, 
aiming to raise the awareness of the disease. If there is a suspicion 
of IMPS, staging based on the risk assessment should be performed 
(Table 7).  
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               15

A fast and reliable diagnosis is crucial for proper management. The initial step involves triaging patients by assessing their risk factors and ruling 
out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), whenever indicated by the patient’s characteristics and clinical presentation. In addition, myocarditis 
warrants consideration whether the first contact was inpatient or 
outpatient.53,54 This approach is based on the different national 
healthcare systems, given that a patient may be first seen in an outpatient or inpatient setting (Figures 5–7).

4.1. General symptoms and signs 
The most common symptom of myocarditis and pericarditis is chest 
pain (sometimes with infarct-like features, especially for myocarditis, 
or pleuritic with respiratory changes, especially for pericarditis). 
Other common presentations include dyspnoea (myocarditis with HF 
presentation, but it is also the most common symptom in the elderly 
with pericarditis) and/or arrhythmias of different degrees (mainly ventricular for myocarditis and supraventricular and AF for pericarditis) 
and, less frequently, syncope. Flow charts are provided for each type 
to guide the diagnostic pathway (see Section 4.3). 
Some patients may present with persistent symptoms without remission and are labelled as patients with incessant/ongoing IMPS. 
4.2. Clinical stages of myocarditis 
4.2.1. Acute myocarditis 
Acute onset is defined as symptoms and signs lasting ≤4 weeks.28 In myocarditis, this entails AM and the subtype fulminant myocarditis (FM). 
The presentation of AM can vary from very mild symptoms 
to a life-threatening condition.10 The typical symptoms and signs at 
presentation include chest pain in >80% of cases, and dyspnoea in 
20%–50%, while fatigue, palpitations, and syncope are less common 
and are reported in about 5%.28,32,55 In the majority of cases (80%), 
symptoms are preceded by prodromes, such as fever (60%), gastrointestinal complaints (30%), or respiratory symptoms (25%).28,55,56 
Other extracardiac symptoms, depending on the underlying disease, 
can be present. Electrocardiogram is normal in a minority of patients 
(about 15%); most frequently, ST-segment elevation is present 
(57.5%), but other ST/T-segment changes can be found (23.5%), as 
well as conduction blocks (10%).28,55 
In most patients with acute presentation, cardiac enzymes [troponin 
T/I and creatinine kinase muscle-brain type (CK-MB)] are elevated.28,55 
Echocardiography is important for clinical evaluation as it might reveal 
signs of myocarditis, including increased wall thickness and echogenicity 
due to myocardial oedema. PEff is seen in up to 25% of patients, reflecting concomitant pericarditis or related to haemodynamic factors.28,55

one or more prognostic predictors, as reported in Table 7, a high-risk patient must be admitted to hospital, and an aetiology search should be performed. Patients without high-risk features can be managed as outpatients without an aetiology search and admission if there is a good response to 
empirical anti-inflammatory therapy.

4.2.2. Fulminant myocarditis 
Fulminant myocarditis (occurring in 3%–9%) is characterized by cardiogenic shock at presentation for which haemodynamic support is 
needed.28 Isolated right ventricle (RV) dysfunction is uncommon; however, biventricular failure occurs frequently in FM. Sustained ventricular 
arrhythmias (VA) may also occur in these patients (46.9%) and some 
present with sudden cardiac death (SCD) (25.8%).28,56,57 
In the majority of children with FM (usually <2 years of age), LV dysfunction with dilatation is present at initial presentation,40 while there is 
usually no LV dilatation in the early phase for adults. Concurrent viral 
infections can be common in these children. 
4.2.3. Subacute myocarditis 
The subacute stage refers to cases with symptoms lasting >1 month 
but ≤3 months. The symptoms are unspecific, and patients might either 
have a remission without residuals or might progress to chronic myocarditis or inflammatory CMP (see Section 10). 
4.2.4. Chronic myocarditis 
Chronic myocarditis is myocarditis persisting beyond 3 months.39 
Chronic myocarditis might reflect an intermediate stage possibly leading to inflammatory CMP, characterized by cardiac remodelling and 
some degree of ventricular dysfunction.10,39 
Milder forms may appear as hypokinetic non-dilated forms of CMP.39 
Moreover, an arrhythmogenic substrate, due to fibrosis, should be considered for the management of these patients.39,58 
Symptoms may be unremarkable in chronic myocarditis.10,39 
Dyspnoea and palpitations might be the leading symptoms.10,39 
Biomarkers of myocardial injury are usually within normal limits.59 
Notably, elevated C-reactive protein, hs-TnT, and impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS) have been associated with EMB-proven 
myocardial inflammation in patients with non-ischaemic HF.60 New 
quantitative CMR techniques have improved the diagnostic yield in patients with chronic myocarditis.61 
4.3. Clinical presentations of myocarditis 
Myocarditis is characterized by the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations (Figure 8); therefore, the diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion. The main patterns of clinical presentation are infarct-like chest 
pain (most frequent symptom), arrhythmias, and HF. Severity may 
range from asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic to severe life-threatening 
scenarios, such as severe HF or VA (potentially leading to SCD). A clinical classification based on presentation as high-risk or non-high-risk 
myocarditis (see Table 7) has been shown to meaningfully predict outcomes in large cohorts.28,62,63 Moreover, myocarditis, especially when 
recurrent, may represent the ‘hot phase’ of some CMPs [e.g. desmoplakin (DSP)-related ARVC].64 Details are given in Section 4.3.5. 
4.3.1. Chest pain presentation 
Chest pain is the most common form of clinical presentation (about 75% 
of unselected cases) in adolescents and adults.28 It is commonly associated 
with an increase in necrosis biomarkers, such as troponin, often with ECG 
alterations (especially ST-segment elevation), which may mimic ACS, despite the absence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). 
These cases are often labelled as infarct-like.65 Patients with this presentation usually report a recent or concomitant viral infection, such as a respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis, which often precedes 
myocarditis by several days to weeks (2–4 weeks). Usually, the presence 
of troponin release in the context of IMPS is not a negative prognostic 
marker, when associated with preserved biventricular function.4,66 
Patients presenting with chest pain and normal left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) without wall motion abnormalities (WMA), no VA, 
and complete resolution of ECG abnormalities in the short term can

with presentation frequency (e.g. chest pain being the most common). Uncomplicated cases of myocarditis (about 75% of unselected cases) usually have 
spontaneous remission.28 In acute myocarditis diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy, up to 50% of patients have spontaneous recovery, but up to 25% 
may have a persistent stable cardiac dysfunction, while 10%–25% have a progressive ventricular dysfunction, which could lead to end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, heart transplantation, or death.9

be considered as having a low-risk presentation with an excellent long- 
term prognosis.4,28,62,66,67 There are possible exceptions to this general 
rule in a few cases with EM and GCM. Myocardial scarring as detected 
by CMR can be present in cases with preserved LVEF.3,68–70 Focal scarring 
of any cause was shown to be relevant for outcome, and small scars (e.g. 
<2 segments) after >6 months seemed to be more benign.71 
Nevertheless, long-term outcome data are missing. For a proposed workflow see Figure 9.

4.3.2. Heart failure presentation 
Patients with myocarditis presenting with acute HF, in particular when 
associated with left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 40%), should be 
considered as a high-risk group, and their prognosis largely depends 
on the short-term response to therapy.28,62 Clinical presentation 
may range from unexplained impaired ventricular function (with or 
without dilated LV), new onset or worsening HF (usually over 
2 weeks to 3 months), to rapidly progressive refractory HF and cardiogenic shock. Fulminant myocarditis presenting with HF has a higher 
rate of cardiac death and heart transplantation (HT) both in the short 
and long term, compared with patients with LV dysfunction without 
FM (see Section 4.2.2).56,73,74 In these scenarios, GCM and EM are independently associated with increased mortality.56,75 An algorithm 
for the proposed workflow is shown in Figure 10. As a central scheme, 
the workflow follows the CHAMPIT approach, provided in the 2021 
ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic 
heart failure.12 One should be aware that arrhythmias can be a presentation of myocarditis, as well as an ‘alternative cause’ of HF outside 
the suspicion of myocarditis. 
4.3.3. Presentation with arrhythmias 
Patients with AM with new, recurrent, or unexplained arrhythmias 
may have a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from palpitations 
to syncope or life-threatening arrhythmias causing aborted 
SCD.10,76 Supraventricular arrhythmias, especially AF,63,77 are 
more common in the presence of concomitant pericarditis and 
PEff, while atrioventricular blocks (AVBs) or sustained VA are generally, but not exclusively, associated with LV dysfunction and HF. 
Patients with advanced AVB or sustained VA should be considered 
as high risk, even in the absence of LV dysfunction. Ventricular fibrillation (VF)/cardiac arrest occurs in about 2.5% of myocarditis-related 
hospitalizations.78 Patients with sustained VA during AM have a high 
risk of recurrence.79 
Patients with GCM (see Section 9.3) or CS (see Section 9.4) are at a 
high risk of VA, with a prevalence of >25%.80–82 
Scar-related VA can occur at any time during follow-up, even after 
inflammation resolution. However, polymorphic and irregular VA are 
more common during the active inflammatory phase, whereas monomorphic and regular VA are associated with healed myocarditis with residuals.83 Consistently, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) 
is more effective when performed in the post-inflammatory stage of the 
disease rather than during AM.84 
AVB is a common feature of myocarditis related to non-viral infections (i.e. CD, LC, diphtheria),85 and can also be an initial presentation 
of CS. In patients with arrhythmic presentation, genetic testing for CMP 
[ARVC/dilated CMP (DCM)/non-dilated left ventricular CMP 
(NDLVC)] should be considered (see Section 5.3). 
An algorithm for the proposed workflow is shown in Figure 11. 
4.3.4. Sudden cardiac death 
One of the causes of SCD in young adults is myocardial inflammation associated with fatal arrhythmias. Sudden cardiac death attributed to myocarditis among autopsied patients ranged from 1.1% to 
12%,87,88 and males show higher incidence rates of SCD than females, with an incidence rate ratio of 2.2.88 Most individuals are 
asymptomatic before SCD; however, between 18% and 48% of 
patients present with symptoms, including viral illness/malaise, syncope, nausea/abdominal pain, chest pain, and palpitations.87,88 Only 
5% show cardiac symptoms in conjunction with an infective process.87 These data highlight the need to suspect a diagnosis of myocarditis early enough. Late gadolinium enhancement in the mid-wall 
layer of the anteroseptal myocardial segments has been associated 
with higher rates of mortality and major VA, including SCD,3,89,90 
even in the presence of preserved LVEF. Septal involvement in myocarditis can be associated with a worse prognosis in the presence of 
a specific genetic background, such as pathogenic desmosomal gene 
variants (see Section 5.3).91,92 Further studies are necessary to confirm these data. 
4.3.5. Presentation of myocarditis with a potential 
genetic background 
A complex interaction between genetic background and inflammation 
might be responsible for the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation 
of myocarditis. An inflammatory stimulus of the heart might unveil an 
increased genetic susceptibility to develop overt LV dysfunction or arrhythmogenic phenotypes. In this setting it is important to consider 
additional features, such as a family history of myocarditis/pericarditis, 
CMP, or SCD. Autosomal dominant gene defects may be associated 
with myocarditis.93–95 Certain autosomal recessive defects in genes encoding various components of the cardiac structure can predispose 
young individuals to myocarditis.95,96 
Different studies reported that patients with myocarditis and evidence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) desmosomal gene variants (mostly with DSP variants) have a higher incidence of adverse 
cardiovascular events, especially myocarditis recurrence and VA, 
than patients without.91,94 Episodes of acute chest pain with troponin 
elevation and normal coronary arteries may occur in about 15% of 
patients with DSP mutations and are associated with LV LGE in about 
90% of cases.97 Specific genetic P/LP variants may increase the susceptibility to superimposed myocarditis in ARVC, which may be 
the first clinical presentation in the natural history of the disease.64,98 
The presence of so-called ‘hot phases’ (chest pain episodes accompanied by ECG changes and troponin release) represents a possible 
clinical presentation of ARVC, which often occurs in paediatric and 
young patients, as well as carriers of DSP genetic variants.99–101 
Currently, the role of ‘hot phases’ in disease progression, as well as 
in arrhythmic risk stratification, remains to be clarified. For more details see Section 5.3. 
4.4. Clinical stages of pericarditis 
4.4.1. Acute pericarditis 
Acute pericarditis is an inflammatory pericardial syndrome with or without 
PEff with an onset of ≤4 weeks. The clinical diagnosis is usually characterized by pleuritic and/or positional chest pain (>80% of cases). Dyspnoea is 
more common in the elderly.45,102 Physical examination may be characterized by pericardial friction rubs in up to one-third of cases, which could disappear with the presence of PEff. Pericardial effusion has been reported in 
up to 60% of cases, and it is usually mild. ECG changes, especially PR 
depression as an early sign and widespread ST-segment elevations, 
have been reported in up to 60% of cases, especially in young patients. 
This is suggestive of concomitant myocardial involvement, at least of 
mild degree.

An inflammatory syndrome is usually present with fever of >38°C 
(70%),37 elevated markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein) (80%– 
90%),36,37 ESR, neutrophil leucocytosis,37,38 and pericardial and/or pleural effusion (approximately 50%), often with lung atelectasis, leading to a 
possible diagnosis of pleuro-pneumonia,37,103 and less commonly, peritoneal involvement (13%).38 This presentation is labelled ‘inflammatory 
phenotype’ of AP. 
Cardiac enzymes are usually normal, but troponin may be elevated in 20%–30% of cases, due to concomitant myocarditis 
(myopericarditis).4 
4.4.2. Subacute pericarditis 
Subacute pericarditis refers to cases with persistent symptoms lasting 
>1 month and <3 months. This condition may directly progress to 
constrictive pericarditis (CP) within a few months and requires timely 
optimal medical therapy and close follow-up to prevent chronic 
evolution.104 
4.4.3. Chronic pericarditis 
Chronic pericarditis refers to cases lasting >3 months. In pericarditis, 
management of the patient during the acute phase is of paramount importance, not only for symptom relief but, most importantly, for prognostic purposes. Hospitalization of patients with AP and high-risk 
features allows the prompt identification and treatment of potentially 
life-threatening complications, such as cardiac tamponade (CTP).105 
Moreover, appropriate screening for specific aetiologies is the basis 
for tailored therapy. Progression of AP to subacute or chronic disease 
is sometimes unpredictable. Omission of colchicine administration and 
the use of high doses of corticosteroids with fast tapering are risk factors for recurrences or a chronic course of the disease.24,106–109 
Recently, scores that predict the individual risk of complicated pericarditis and chronicity have been proposed for the identification of subjects who require intensive therapy in terms of medication dose and 
length, as well as close follow-up.43,44,110 They require further validation 
in prospective, multicentre studies. 
In chronic forms, symptoms are similar to previous attack(s), 
but often milder.1 In unclear cases or in difficult-to-treat patients, 
CMR may be performed to assess the degree of inflammation and 
individualize medical therapy, especially before drug tapering or 
discontinuation.111,112 
Paradoxically, although chronic pericarditis significantly impairs quality of life, the rate of progression to CP is negligible (<1%) and is lower 
than the risk imposed by a single episode of AP, unless a specific aetiology is identified.105,113,114 
4.5. Clinical presentations of pericarditis 
Pericarditis is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. 
The main presenting symptom of pericarditis is positional chest pain, 
which is reported in most affected individuals. Typical pericardial pain 
is sharp and is worse when coughing and taking a deep breath (pleuritic). 
Left trapezius ridge pain is a classic symptom of pericardial irritation and is 
transmitted through the phrenic nerve. Other less common symptoms 
include shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, and arrhythmia (e.g. AF). 
Pericardial effusion often accompanies pericarditis (>50% of cases). 
Other presentations include right HF-like symptoms [elevated jugular 
venous pressure (JVP), peripheral oedema, ascites] when constriction 
is present. Hypotension is a sign of CTP (which presents with Beck’s 
triad: hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds). 
It is crucial to differentiate pericarditis from other diseases, such as ACS, 
congestive HF, pneumonia with pleuritis, pulmonary embolism, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and vasculitis. 
4.5.1. Dry pericarditis 
Dry pericarditis (40%–50% of cases), also referred to as ‘pericarditis sicca’, is a form of pericarditis that is characterized by inflammation of the 
pericardium without the presence of PEff. It can begin insidiously or 
abruptly. It is usually not associated with a specific cause or a worse 
prognosis. 
4.5.2. Effusive pericarditis 
Effusive pericarditis (50%–60% of cases) is characterized by the concurrent presence of effusion.115 A moderate to large PEff is more commonly associated with a non-idiopathic aetiology. 
4.5.3. Effusive–constrictive pericarditis 
Effusive–constrictive pericarditis (ECP) is characterized by the concurrent presence of PEff, along with thickening and constriction of 
the pericardium that restricts the normal filling of the heart.116 
Effusive–constrictive pericarditis occurs when constrictive physiology is uncovered following the drainage of a PEff with tamponade. 
The exact haemodynamic definition involves the right atrial pressure 
(RAP) failing to fall by ≥50% or to a level of <10 mmHg despite intrapericardial pressure being lowered to near 0 mmHg with removal of 
pericardial fluid via pericardiocentesis.110,116,117 Current multimodality imaging allows a clinical diagnosis of ECP without cardiac 
catheterization. 
4.5.4. Pericarditis with cardiac tamponade 
The two most serious complications of pericarditis are CTP and CP. 
Pericarditis with CTP is a life-threatening condition where inflammation 
of the pericardium leads to the accumulation of compressive pericardial 
fluid (Table 8).110,115 Symptoms may include chest discomfort, fatigue, 
and dyspnoea. Clinical signs include hypotension, tachycardia, raised 
JVP, pulsus paradoxus, muffled heart sounds, electrical alternans with 
decreased ECG voltage, and an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest 
X-ray. The magnitude of clinical and haemodynamic abnormalities depends on the amount of pericardial fluid and rate of accumulation, 
the distensibility of the pericardium, and the compliance and filling pressures of the cardiac chambers118 (Figure 12).

4.5.5. Constrictive pericarditis 
Pericardial constriction is a chronic condition characterized by a thickened, fibrotic, and often calcified pericardium that leads to impaired diastolic filling of the heart. It should be named CP when associated with 
pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis is a consequence of chronic pericardial inflammation and is characterized by scarring, fibrosis, and loss 
of elasticity of the pericardium. The main symptoms are dyspnoea, 
oedema, orthopnoea, and fatigue. The classic clinical picture is usually 
characterized by isolated right HF with normal or nearly normal natriuretic peptide levels. Venous congestion, hepatomegaly, pleural effusions, and ascites may occur.110,115,119 Constrictive pericarditis should 
be treated empirically with anti-inflammatory therapy. Cases after failure of medical therapy and pericardial constriction without pericarditis 
should be referred for pericardiectomy without delay (Figure 13).

4.5.6. Transient constrictive pericarditis 
Transient constriction is CP with ongoing inflammation that can be reversed following anti-inflammatory treatment or that heals spontaneously. 
It develops with pericarditis with or without PEff (about 10% of 
cases) and resolves with anti-inflammatory therapy in >50% of 
cases.120,121 A trial of 3–6 months of anti-inflammatory therapy is recommended in patients with newly diagnosed CP before referral for 
pericardiectomy.122,123 Biomarkers (e.g. elevated C-reactive protein) 
and multimodality imaging, including CMR, are mandatory to detect 
pericardial inflammation. 
4.5.6.1. Constrictive pathophysiology

HF symptoms.115,120,121,124 There may be features of septal bounce,

Empirical anti-inflammatory therapy is warranted only for those with evidence of pericarditis (by clinical criteria, biomarkers, and/or imaging). Low risk: 
clinical remission after therapy/normalization of imaging findings. Intermediate risk: improved symptoms without complete remission/partial regression. 
High risk: persistent symptoms/persistent imaging signs of constriction. aSee Table 6. bSee Table 7.

Doppler features of constriction without HF symptoms (see  
Supplementary data online, Section 2.4 and Figure S1). 
4.5.7. Pericarditis with polyserositis 
Pericarditis with polyserositis is characterized by inflammation of the 
pericardium and concurrent inflammation of other serous membranes 
lining major body cavities, such as the pleura and peritoneum.37,103,125,126 
4.5.8. Inflammatory vs non-inflammatory pericarditis 
In the context of pericarditis, the terms ‘inflammatory’ and ‘non- 
inflammatory’ phenotype refer to two distinct clinical presentations 
based on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. 
4.5.8.1. Inflammatory phenotype of pericarditis 
The inflammatory phenotype is characterized by inflammation of the 
pericardium with evidence of systemic inflammation. This phenotype 
is often associated with fever, and/or elevated systemic inflammatory 
markers (e.g. C-reactive protein), PEff, and/or pleural effusion. These 
forms typically respond well to targeted anti-inflammatory therapies, 
including colchicine and anti-IL-1 agents.37,127 
4.5.8.2. Non-inflammatory phenotype of pericarditis 
The non-inflammatory phenotype refers to the manifestation of pericarditis without C-reactive protein elevation or low elevation of markers of 
systemic inflammation (e.g. high-sensitivity C-reactive protein).127 This occurs in 10%–20% of patients with pericarditis.36 The pathogenesis of pericarditis with normal C-reactive protein is unknown and these cases are 
often difficult to treat. C-reactive protein is a sensitive albeit unspecific biomarker of inflammation mainly driven by IL-6. Moreover, in autoimmune 
diseases characterized by the type I interferon (IFN) gene signature, 
C-reactive protein appears to be an unreliable marker of inflammation.52 
5. Diagnosis and diagnostic 
work-up 
The diagnostic work-up in patients with suspected IMPS should be tailored based on the severity of clinical presentation, response to medical 
therapy, and individual risk (Table 7). It includes medical history, clinical/ 
physical exam, biomarkers (myocardial injury, systemic inflammation, 
and HF), ECG, and multimodality imaging. Endomyocardial biopsy has 
its place in dedicated clinical scenarios. For IMPS, routine viral serology 
is not recommended,1 except for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as 
well as for suspected bacterial infections (such as Borrelia spp., rickettsial, and T. cruzi infections). Echocardiography is the basic imaging method, followed by other techniques. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance 
is an advanced imaging test of increasing importance for detection of 
myocardial as well as pericardial injury.115,128 Most important is a 
patient-tailored approach, usually driven by the dominant symptoms. 
Flow charts (Figures 5–7 and 9–13) illustrate the proposed workflow 
in different clinical scenarios. If a patient presents with clinical symptoms suggestive of IMPS (Table 6), basic and advanced diagnostic assessments are recommended (see Table 9).

5.1. Electrocardiogram 
Dynamic changes in the ST segment are classic hallmarks of pericarditis and myocarditis. The most typical pattern includes widespread 
ST-segment elevation, reported in 20%–60% of cases (see  
Supplementary data online, Table S4). In pericarditis, ECG changes 
suggest concomitant myocardial involvement, and are indicative of 
inflammation of the subepicardium.35 These changes are more common in the initial phase and may be more frequent in younger patients. ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion may also be 
present, albeit less frequently than in patients with acute myocardial 
ischaemia,132 and may be related to the extent of myocardial 
damage.133,134 Diffuse depression of the PR segment is a classic early 
finding in AP. 
A decrease in the amplitude of QRS complexes on ECG can be 
observed in cases of AP and/or AM, especially with large effusions or 
extensive myocardial injury. Electrical alternans of the QRS complexes 
has been reported, attributed to fluctuation of the heart within a 
large effusion (swinging heart). Lengthening of the QT interval might occur in AM. 
Atrial fibrillation can occur in AP, especially in predisposed patients, 
in whom pericardial inflammation may be a trigger for supraventricular 
arrhythmias.77 In contrast, VA are more common in myocarditis. 
AVBs and intraventricular conduction defects, particularly right bundle branch blocks, are not uncommon (see Section 4.3.3, and  
Supplementary data online, Table S4) and may be associated with 
more severe presentations.135–137 
Electrocardiogram changes are highly dynamic and may evolve over a 
span of hours or days, with temporal progression varying significantly 
among patients. Typically, ST changes resolve; however, it is important 
to note that a normal ECG at presentation does not exclude the possibility of IMPS. 
5.2. Biomarkers 
5.2.1. Biomarkers in clinical routine 
Recommended biomarkers in IMPS include: 
• Markers of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein): C-reactive 
protein is often increased in patients with pericarditis (up to 80%) 
and AM (up to 80%), and contributes to the diagnosis.28,36,138 
Negative results, however, do not exclude the diagnosis. In pericarditis, C-reactive protein is a marker of disease activity that could be 
used to guide the duration of anti-inflammatory therapy.36 
D-dimers are currently being investigated for their diagnostic and 
prognostic relevance.36,139,140 
• Markers of myocardial lesions (e.g. troponin): Troponin is elevated in myocardial involvement, usually indicating cardiomyocyte 
necrosis. Assessment of baseline troponin is crucial to diagnose the 
severity of myocarditis. It is typically increased in infarct-like 
myocarditis. 
• Markers of HF (BNP or NT-proBNP): Assessment of baseline level 
is recommended among patients with suspected myocarditis. This 
measurement can be repeated at discharge and during follow-up in 
an outpatient setting to assess the risk of clinical events. 
NT-proBNP can be used in patients with myocarditis as a predictive 
marker of HF among patients with normal or impaired LVEF.12

but could help based on a strong clinical suspicion,73 e.g. miR721 was 
shown to have a discriminatory capacity.141 
In specific circumstances, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β, 
IL-6, and IL-17A may be of value. Similarly, in some cases, evaluation of 
cardio-specific antibodies may be helpful, according to the local laboratory availability. These include organ-specific anti-heart autoantibodies 
and anti-intercalated disc autoantibodies, as well as non-organ-specific 
serum autoantibodies.10 These autoantibodies, especially if found at 
high titres, may have a negative prognostic value.73,142 
Furthermore, a specific serum biomarker, i.e. the soluble form of the 
IL-1 receptor-like 1 (IL-1RL1), also known as ST2, was associated with a 
higher risk of severe HF among male myocarditis patients.143 Other 
biomarkers have been studied in myocarditis, including procollagen 
type III, gelsolin, soluble VCAM-1, galectin-3, serum alarmin S100A8/ 
S100A9, immunoglobulin free light chain, and heparin-binding protein, 
for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. However, these biomarkers were evaluated among limited small cohorts and are clinically not 
routinely used.144,145 
5.3. Genetics 
Genetic testing is relatively new in the field of IMPS. There is a potential 
overlap with CMPs. Myocarditis and pericarditis will be discussed 
separately. 
There has been increasing evidence that gene variants coding for structural proteins, particularly desmosomal and sarcomeric proteins, may 
overlap with acute and recurrent myocarditis and affect disease severity.94,95 Furthermore, it has been shown that there is an overlap of gene 
variants predisposing to myocardial inflammation and inherited CMP 
(ARVC and NDLVC).13 In particular, myocardial inflammation may be detected in patients with inherited CMP using serum and imaging biomarkers.13 There is evidence that these patients are at higher risk for 
complicated myocarditis (Section 4.3.5).13,91,93,94 In a meta-analysis, the 
pooled prevalence of P/LP variants was 4.2% for uncomplicated myocarditis, whereas for complicated myocarditis the pooled prevalence was 22% 
and 45% in adults and children, respectively.95 Pathogenic/likely pathogenic 
variants in desmosomal genes were more common in uncomplicated 
myocarditis (64%), while variants in sarcomeric genes were more prevalent in complicated myocarditis (58% in adults and 71% in children).95 
A case series demonstrated a high proportion of definite or probable pathogenic variants in patients with myocarditis with RV involvement or sustained VA.146 Furthermore, DSP variants have 
been reported in familial recurrent myocarditis.147 Another study 
demonstrated overlap of gene variants in myocarditis and inherited 
CMP.96 
Identifying such gene variants has several clinical implications: 
(1) While in myocarditis there is a recommendation to defer on implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement during the 
acute phase of the disease, the threshold for ICD placement is lower in ARVC in cases of primary prevention.58 
(2) Gene variants predisposing to myocarditis have relevant implications for patients.147,148 Details are given in the 2023 ESC 
Guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies.13 
(3) Cascade clinical and genetic screening for relatives and familial genetic counselling should be offered.93,149 
As scientific knowledge about gene variants and their potential 
pathophysiological role has been continuously increasing over recent years, comprehensive screening includes desmosomal and sarcomeric genes and some DCM-associated genes.64,91,96,146,150 For 
details, see 2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies.13 Nevertheless, it is not clear whether the inflammatory 
process acts as a trigger or is fully part of the pathophysiological process in inherited CMP.151 
Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants have been identified in patients 
with recurrent pericarditis (RP), especially young patients, with a family 
history, multiple recurrences, inflammatory phenotype, and refractory 
or dependent on medical treatments. Recurrent pericarditis has been 
associated with genetic variants for monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (e.g. FMF, TRAPS), but also with genes related to the inflammatory response (Figure 14).50,51,152,153 
A recent study performed whole-exome sequencing in 108 patients 
with RP. Overall, about 15% of patients had variants in genes related to 
the inflammatory response, while up to 30% of patients carried variants 
in different cardiac genes, worthy of a deeper investigation.51 These 
data suggest a genetic predisposition in at least a subset of patients 
(positive family history of pericarditis or periodic fever, poor response 
to colchicine, multiple recurrences with inflammatory phenotype), and 
counselling may be offered.51,152 In these clinical scenarios, prolonged 
therapy with specific biological agents (e.g. anti-IL-1 agents) should be 
considered.

5.4. Multimodality imaging 
The non-invasive diagnosis of IMPS relies on advanced cardiovascular imaging. An overview of the capabilities of different imaging modalities for 
the identification of pathophysiological components is provided in  
Supplementary data online, Table S5. Echocardiography is usually the 
first-step imaging modality and provides functional and morphological information. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance can better differentiate 
myocardial tissue and shows myocardial and pericardial inflammation, 
as well as different patterns of fibrosis. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography (FDG-PET) is useful to detect disease activity, especially for CS (see Section 5.8). Computed tomography allows detection 
of calcification of the pericardium and its extent, as well as exclusion of 
CAD. The application of non-invasive imaging should guide therapeutic 
decision-making (see Section 4). 
5.5. Echocardiography 
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is usually the initial imaging modality of choice for individuals with suspected IMPS, given its ability to 
identify myocardial and pericardial abnormalities, as well as concomitant valvular disease.115,124 
5.5.1. Echocardiography in myocarditis 
Patients with a suspicion of myocarditis should usually undergo standard 
TTE including speckle tracking or tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) at presentation. Transthoracic echocardiography helps monitor changes in cardiac chamber size, ventricular function, wall thickness, and PEff. In 
myocarditis, global ventricular dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction with 
preserved ejection fraction (EF), and regional WMA may occur.154,155 
Tissue Doppler imaging or strain imaging can be used in the setting of 
myocarditis and may indicate myocardial injury.156,157 Recent studies 
have shown that global longitudinal and circumferential strain (GLS 
and GCS) and strain rate were decreased in patients with AM, even 
with preserved EF.156 Strain may provide important prognostic information in AM.157 Regional GLS can be associated with scarring on 
CMR and can predict VA and outcomes in patients with AM.157 
Abnormal RV strain158 and left atrial (LA) strain159 have been detected 
in AM with preserved EF. 
5.5.2. Echocardiography in pericarditis 
Transthoracic echocardiography can detect the presence of PEff and 
assess its haemodynamic importance, as well as constrictive pathophysiology (Supplementary data online, Figure S1 and Table S6).

Acute pericarditis patients may have a normal-appearing TTE (40%– 
50% of cases in first episodes); however, the presence of new or worsening PEff is a diagnostic criterion for pericarditis.24,115,160 The size of 
PEff is assessed by the end-diastolic distance of the echo-free space between the epicardium and parietal pericardium (Table 10).115,128 It is recommended that images should include the extent and location of each 
effusion measurement, as this allows follow-up studies. Transthoracic 
echocardiography enables the recognition of CTP and the presence 
of constriction.115 
5.6. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance 
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance is the accepted gold standard for 
the quantification of biventricular function and detection of WMA. 
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance has the advantage of tissue differentiation, non-invasively detecting myocardial and pericardial inflammation, as well as fibrosis.30 The diagnostic targets in non-ischaemic 
myocardial inflammation include myocardial oedema, hyperaemia and 
capillary leak, and necrosis/fibrosis (see Supplementary data online,  
Figure S2).161–164 The diagnostic accuracy of CMR is higher if performed 
early in the time course of disease (best within the first 2 weeks). 
Myocardial oedema and changes due to inflammation lead to increased 
tissue water content that can be detected as increased signal intensities 
on T2-weighted imaging and/or T2 mapping; increased tissue free- 
water content will also lead to an increased signal in T1 mapping and 
extracellular volume (ECV) quantification. Myocyte necrosis and fibrosis can result in non-ischaemic (e.g. mid-wall, subepicardial, patchy) patterns of LGE, which do not typically follow a coronary artery 
distribution. The identification of myocarditis with chest pain presentation is less challenging than in HF and arrhythmic scenarios. The updated LLC, which include parametric mapping methods (T1/T2/ECV), 
should be applied for diagnosis, as the combined approach increases 
the diagnostic accuracy (see Figure 4).30 It is important to note that imaging evidence of myocardial inflammation does not provide the underlying histotype (see Supplementary data online, Figure S2). 
In the case of pericarditis, CMR detects thickening, oedema, and LGE 
of the pericardium.110,129,165 It is important to note that pericardial 
LGE may imply ongoing inflammation and neovascularization rather 
than simple scarring (see Supplementary data online, Figure S2). 
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance is helpful for an objective assessment of the degree of inflammatory involvement of the pericardium, 
either for first diagnoses or follow-up (for details see Figure 7 and  
Table 9). 
Given its physical properties, CMR is affected by ferromagnetic objects, such as valvular prosthesis and implants, resulting in artefacts. 
The same holds true for active MR-conditional devices, such as pacemakers, ICDs, and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacemakers/defibrillators (P/Ds), but dedicated techniques are now 
available to achieve better diagnostic image quality in many cases.166 
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance could also be used in patients 
with non-conditional devices with a clear clinical indication if other imaging modalities are not helpful. In all cases, programming of the implanted device before and after the scan is warranted, as well as 
patient monitoring. 
Even in intubated patients, CMR scans are feasible in order to detect 
inflammation.167 If breath-hold capacities are reduced or the patient is 
uncooperative, fast imaging techniques and/or motion-corrected imaging have to be applied.168 
5.7. Computed tomography 
Computed tomography is an established tool for excluding CAD depending on the risk score and can be used in the diagnostic work-up 
according to current ESC guidelines.65,72,195 
Contrast-enhanced CT may be very useful to make an aetiological 
diagnosis in patients presenting with large PEff including tamponade.196 
Computed tomography is important before pericardiectomy for constriction to evaluate the anatomy and extent of calcifications as a higher 
burden of pericardial calcification has been associated with a better 
post-surgical outcome.197 Furthermore, anatomical abnormalities, 
such as pectus excavatum, can be identified.198 Meanwhile, CT in combination with FDG-PET plays a crucial role in the detection of CS 
(Section 9.4).

5.8. Nuclear medicine 
Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake reflects metabolically active inflammatory 
cells in AM.201 
Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography can be considered as an alternative in patients when CMR is unsuitable because of 
an irregular heartbeat or device-related artefacts.202 Simultaneous/hybrid 
cardiac PET-CT/CMR imaging complement each other in the assessment of myocarditis compared with either approach alone.201,203 
Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is also a powerful 
tool to detect and assess the extent of extracardiac involvement in sarcoidosis (see Section 9.4). 
Appropriate fasting before FDG-PET is a must to obtain reliable results.204 Typical preparation protocols include a high-fat and low- 
carbohydrate diet for 12–24 h followed by complete fasting other 
than water for the 6–12-h period prior to FDG injection. 
The role of nuclear imaging in pericarditis is less well established. The 
use of FDG-PET/CT in pericarditis is generally complementary and is 
most often implemented in cases where CMR cannot be used.205 
5.9. Endomyocardial and pericardial biopsy 
5.9.1. Endomyocardial biopsy 
Endomyocardial biopsy enables the identification of the underlying 
histological subtype of cardiac inflammation.10,34,207,208 However, non- 
invasive imaging methods have significantly improved, allowing the diagnosis of myocarditis by CMR. Therefore, the role of EMB in clinical 
practice has changed. Endomyocardial biopsy remains important for 
high-risk patients and in some intermediate cases when the knowledge 
of the histological subtype and the identification of a possible viral aetiology are important for targeted therapies (Figure 15).207,209 
Endomyocardial biopsy has potential complications (e.g. cardiac perforation/tamponade, thromboembolism, valvular trauma, severe arrhythmias, and death).9,210 Rates depend on the setting and centre experience 
and range between 0.6% and 5%,63,211 and increase up to 26% in FM 
cases on mechanical circulatory support (MCS).212 Children may have 
higher complication rates depending on age, the experience of the centre, and the site of the biopsy (LV or RV).63,213 On this basis, the clinical 
use of EMB should be tailored according to the risk–benefit ratio. 
Histological and immunohistological investigations, as well as viral genome analysis, allow the identification of viral or immune-mediated LM, EM, 
GCM, and sarcoidosis.33,214,215 Moreover, EMB allows the identification of 
the inflammatory stages in association with the degree of myocardial necrosis and fibrosis. Endomyocardial biopsy is useful in the differential diagnosis of infiltrative/storage diseases (amyloidosis, haemochromatosis, 
glycogenosis), different CMPs, and genetic heart diseases33,216 if non- 
invasive imaging is inconclusive. This approach is consistent with other 
international position statements.9,210 Endomyocardial biopsy can be useful in cases of chronic CMP that is progressive or unresponsive to standard therapy. When FM, GCM or EM are suspected, early EMB is required 
to start immunosuppressive therapy rapidly and improve outcomes.57 In 
GCM, EMB has high sensitivity (80%–93%) and a positive predictive value 
(71%), especially if performed within 2–4 weeks from symptom onset.217 
In CS, EMB may have a low sensitivity (20%–30%) due to the focal nature 
of inflammatory lesions, but can be improved by guiding the EMB using 
CMR or electro-anatomical mapping (EAM).218–222 
Historically, diagnosis by EMB was based on the histological Dallas criteria in HE-stained heart tissue sections revealing myocytolysis and interstitial immune cells.223 However, since there is high interobserver 
variability, immunohistochemical detection of lymphocytes (CD3) and 
macrophages (CD68) can definitely increase sensitivity for the diagnosis 
of myocarditis.10,224–226 A recent meta-analysis indicates that the use of 
immunohistochemistry can increase the detection rate of inflammation 
in EMB specimens to ∼51%.227 A value of ≥14 leucocytes/mm2 with T 
lymphocytes of ≥7 cells/mm2 has been considered as the cut-off for 
the diagnosis of myocarditis.10 In acute LM, the number of T lymphocytes 
is generally higher (>25 cells/mm2).228 Additionally, the expression of 
MHC class II molecules in antigen-presenting macrophages and endothelial cells is routinely observed in EMB with myocarditis.33 Endomyocardial 
biopsy also enables the detection of viruses, such as enteroviruses, 
B19V,228 and herpesviruses, e.g. EBV and HHV-6, using quantitative real- 
time (RT)-PCR and in situ hybridization. It is likely that advances in molecular diagnostic techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, will 
help to identify potential new pathogens. Positive PCR results obtained 
on EMB have to be accompanied by a parallel investigation of blood samples collected at the time of the EMB to exclude acute systemic virus infection. In cases of acute cardiac and systemic virus infection, 
immunosuppressive therapy must be avoided. 
The most common site of EMB is the RV septum, but occasionally LV 
or biventricular EMB may be needed. The decision of the EMB site should 
be based on the clinical indication, findings of pre-procedural imaging, and 
operator expertise.229 A study of 755 patients with suspected myocarditis and non-ischaemic CMP (including infiltrative and storage disorders) 
indicated that biventricular EMB can increase diagnostic accuracy compared with selective LV or RV EMB.211 Sampling error is the major limitation of the diagnostic accuracy of EMB. The minimal number of 
required EMB samples for each technique is reported in Table 11.33 
It should be emphasized that PCR in EMB tissue and in situ hybridization can be used for identification of the viral agent, because viral serology concurs with the results of PCR in a minority of patients 
(∼4%) with myocarditis.230 With PCR, the rate of viral sequences detected in EMB specimens is up to 67%, although the rate varies widely 
among studies.63,228,231 The PCR tests for the detection of infectious 
agents must be performed in laboratories that are accredited and certified for the identification of viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The evaluation of these PCR results must be done in the context of histological/ 
immunohistological findings by pathologists with expertise in cardiovascular diseases. 
The timely communication of biopsy results is crucial for optimal 
therapeutic guidance. 
Targeted biopsies of an inflamed heart diagnosed using histology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular virology could be correlated with modern technologies, such as genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics to improve the diagnosis and therapy. Recommendations 
for EMB can be found in Recommendation Table 1.

CD3+ T cells (E) and CD68+ macrophages (F). (G–I) In acute eosinophilic myocarditis, necrosis of cardiomyocytes is associated with numerous eosinophilic granulocytes (G, Giemsa stain), some CD3+ T cells (H), and numerous CD68+ macrophages (I). (J–L) Areas with severe cardiomyocyte necrosis in 
the presence of extensive focal and diffuse infiltration of eosinophilic granulocytes (J, Giemsa stain), CD3+ T cells (K), and CD68+ macrophages and 
CD68+ giant cells (L) are typical of giant-cell myocarditis. (M–O) Cardiac sarcoidosis is histologically characterized by the presence of granulomas, usually in the absence of cardiomyocyte necrosis (M, Giemsa stain), but with focal infiltration of CD3+ T cells (N) and numerous CD68+ macrophages and 
CD68+ giant cells (O).

5.9.2. Pericardial biopsy 
In clinical practice, pericardial biopsy is rarely indicated in complicated 
cases not responding to conventional anti-inflammatory therapy and 
with a high suspicion of a specific aetiology (e.g. primary pericardial tumours and metastases), which cannot be determined by non-invasive 
diagnostic methods. Pericardial biopsy can be performed by pericardioscopy (an endoscopic study of the pericardium that is available in a limited number of tertiary referral centres). It is more commonly 
performed with a thoracoscopic or surgical approach, usually during 
a pericardial drainage or a pericardial window.1,232 
5.10. Role of autopsy 
In autopsy studies of SCD, myocarditis has been described as a common finding, with incidences of myocarditis in children and adults ranging from 0.3% to 14.8%.87,88,233–235 In the majority of these studies, the 
incidence of myocarditis in SCD was higher in people aged under 
35 years.236,237 A nationwide unselected cohort of 14 294 deaths in 
Denmark suggested that 6% of all autopsied SCD was caused by myocarditis. Males have a significantly higher incidence.88 In the UK, between 1994 and 2022, myocarditis was reported as a rare cause of 
SCD in non-hospitalized individuals (1.1%) in 7702 consecutive cases 
of SCD. Here, the most common reported form was LM (56%), which 
corresponds well with data obtained from EMBs of patients with suspected myocarditis.10,63,87,238 
In the guidelines for the histopathological diagnosis of myocarditis, 
‘fulminant’ or ‘multifocal’ myocarditis can be generally considered as a 
reliable or acceptable cause of death, especially when inflammation is 
the only substantial histopathological finding. This approach is endorsed 
by the Association of European Cardiovascular Pathology.239 
In addition to LM, other types of cardiac inflammation are observed 
in autopsies. In 558 of 49 612 (1.1%) forensic autopsies, myocarditis 
was detected by histology. In a Finnish study consisting of 351 patients 
with CS, 14% experienced fatal and aborted SCD as a presenting manifestation. In 64%, undiagnosed granulomas in the heart were the cause 
of fatalities.240 The likelihood that a case of unexplained SCD is caused 
by an underlying inherited disorder has led to the emerging role of genetic testing of DNA obtained at autopsy (also called molecular autopsy 
or post-mortem genetic testing).239 Therefore, pathologists play an important role in the identification of families at risk by reporting whether 
it is recommended to refer first-degree family members for clinical 
screening and/or to perform additional post-mortem genetic testing 
to identify the underlying cause of cardiac inflammation.241,242 Legal 
and ethical issues related to genetic testing in deceased subjects who 
did not give their consent are not universally regulated by law. 
5.11. Role of cardiac catheterization and 
coronary angiography 
Given the overlap of symptoms (especially chest pain), as well as the 
elevation of biomarkers (such as troponin in the case of myocardial involvement and NT-proBNP) and ECG changes, ACS is the main differential diagnosis for IMPS. Depending on the initial clinical assessment, 
ACS should be ruled out according to current guidelines (Figure 9). 
The recommended methods are coronary CT or invasive coronary 
angiography depending on likelihood of obstructive CAD.72,248 
Coronary angiography is preferable in patients with a high likelihood 
of ACS. It should be noted that CAD may coexist with myocarditis 
in particular scenarios, including EM and ICI-induced myocarditis.249–251 
Cardiac catheterization is also indicated to monitor and guide HF 
therapy, as well as the early need for more advanced support (HT or 
MCS) in the case of refractory haemodynamic deterioration.12

For pericarditis, specific indications for cardiac catheterization include the differential diagnosis between restrictive CMP (RCM) or 
CP,252 when this differentiation cannot be done by multimodality imaging (see Supplementary data online, Section 2.6). 
5.12. Electro-anatomical mapping 
The diagnostic yield of traditional fluoroscopy-guided EMB in patients 
with suspected myocarditis may decrease with segmental or patchy 
myocardial involvement, as seen in CS. Electro-anatomical mapping, 
using bipolar and unipolar voltage mapping, allows the identification 
of low-voltage areas, which reflects abnormal myocardial tissue (scarring, inflammation), and therefore guides EMB.218–222 Unipolar 
EAM-guided EMB demonstrated a higher diagnostic yield than bipolar 
EAM (83% compared with 63%), consistent with the epicardial 
substrate.84,218,221 
A meta-analysis of 148 patients showed a higher diagnostic performance of EAM-guided EMB in CS compared with other forms of myocarditis. The sensitivity of any abnormal electrogram for a positive EMB 
was high (92%) but was associated with moderate specificity (58%).221 
Electro-anatomical mapping has demonstrated good sensitivity and 
specificity compared with CMR for the detection of pathological areas 
of the myocardium.218 The value of EAM to guide biopsy may be lower 
in AM as low-voltage areas correlate well with LGE, but not with oedema.253 There may also be discordance between low-voltage areas 
and LGE on CMR. However, the combination of unipolar/bipolar EAM 
with CMR findings increased the diagnosis yield of EMB,218 especially in 
CS.220 The EAM pattern may also help to differentiate between differential diagnoses, especially between CS and ARVC,254 as CS often involves 
the basal septum and exhibits a higher bipolar/unipolar low-voltage area 
ratio. The reported complication rate of EAM-guided EMB is <5%.218,221 
Programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) has not been evaluated in 
the acute setting and should not be performed in the acute phase. It 
could be useful for arrhythmia stratification in selected patients with 
non-active myocarditis, with LGE and risk factors for ventricular arrythmias (Section 6.5).255 
6. Therapy 
The aim of medical therapy for IMPS is to relieve symptoms and to prevent complications, especially recurrences and mortality in complicated 
cases. Medical therapy targets include: (i) infectious agents; (ii) inflammation; (iii) immune-mediated processes; (iv) HF and ventricular 
dysfunction (in cases of myocarditis); (v) arrhythmias; and (vi) 
constriction (in cases of pericarditis). Treatments are individualized according to the specific case and the presumed or diagnosed pathogenesis, and specific therapeutic concepts will be discussed in the section 
covering specific causes. There may be differences depending on 
whether an isolated or a combined form is present. The current evidence is more focused on the isolated cases. For combined conditions, 
the leading one (myopericarditis or perimyocarditis) should guide the 
therapeutic decision-making and subsequent follow-up. 
6.1. Non-pharmacological therapy for 
inflammatory myopericardial syndrome 
An important non-pharmacological concept is the restriction of physical 
activity beyond sedentary activities until symptom resolution and clinical 
remission with normalization of inflammatory markers. This temporary 
limitation of physical activities should be individualized according to each 
patient, and the response to therapy until clinical remission. According 
to clinical presentation, at least 1 month is needed to reach clinical remission, but it can last longer. Depending on the stage and risk of the 
IMPS, physical activity should be tailored, and temporary restriction of 
physical activity is necessary in the acute phase of the disease (see 
Section 7). Previous consensus statements and guidelines11 have tried 
to provide a fixed time interval. This TF suggests personalizing the treatment until clinical remission based on a multiparametric assessment, 
which was also supported by the 2024 ACC expert consensus paper.9 
Clinical remission is defined as full regression of symptoms, as well as 
normalization of laboratory results (e.g. C-reactive protein, troponin levels) and investigations (ECG, evidence of PEff, CMR evidence of active 
inflammation) (Table 3). Additional testing (e.g. exercise testing and 
Holter monitoring) is recommended for patients with myocarditis for 
the detection of clinical remission. After a prolonged rest period, a gradual, monitored return to work and physical activity may be helpful, if necessary, guided by a qualified rehabilitation. Currently, evidence-based 
data are missing on this topic, and the decision must be individualized. 
6.2. Pharmacological therapy 
6.2.1. Pharmacological therapy for myocarditis 
6.2.1.1. General principles 
This section will focus on general aspects and non-aetiology-directed 
therapy. It should be recognized that evidence is very limited in this field 
and this document will provide guidance for clinical practice. 
Medical therapy of myocarditis is based on clinical presentation, case severity, and aetiology. It includes general supportive, non-aetiology-directed 
therapy (e.g. HF therapy),12,259 anti-arrhythmic therapy, and specific therapy (aetiology-directed therapy).58,260,261 Corticosteroids are considered 
for autoimmunity-associated cases to suppress the immune system, as first- 
line therapy in most cases. Severe cases are considered for MCS and HT. 
Uncomplicated cases of myocarditis usually present with chest pain 
and can be empirically treated with aspirin or non-steroidal anti- 
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the control of chest pain, if needed. 
This is supported by a small study showing no harm for patients treated 
with anti-inflammatory drugs.262 Concomitant use of colchicine is safe 
in patients with myopericarditis, preventing recurrences.263 In clinical 
practice, β-blockers are often used in patients with myocarditis. In a 
small study, β-blockers were associated with better outcomes, defined 
as freedom from cardiac death or HT.264

6.2.1.2. Fulminant myocarditis 
Fulminant myocarditis is a rare and severe presentation of myocarditis 
and a cause of cardiogenic shock, and should be treated accordingly 
with inotropic or vasopressor support or, if needed, MCS (see 
Section 6.3).265 It is crucial to be aware of the condition and, when 
needed, to refer patients to tertiary referral centres that can institute 
temporary MCS and perform early EMB. Early EMB has been independently associated with a lower rate of death or HT/left ventricular assist 
device (LVAD) at 1 year.57 The timely communication of biopsy results 
is crucial. Specific subtypes of FM (e.g. biopsy-proven non-infectious 
forms) may respond to immunosuppressive therapy in addition to 
guideline-directed medical care.12,34 An ongoing trial is evaluating corticosteroids for FM (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05150704). 
6.2.1.3. Acute myocarditis 
Acute myocarditis has a high rate of spontaneous recovery, especially in 
uncomplicated cases. In cases of AM diagnosed by EMB, up to 50% of 
patients have spontaneous recovery and up to 25% may have a persistent stable cardiac dysfunction. Only 10%–25% have a progressive ventricular dysfunction, which could lead to end-stage DCM, HT, or 
death.9 Treatment of AM depends on severity and clinical presentation. 
Risk stratification of these patients is mandatory to assess the required 
level of care. 
The acute phase of viral myocarditis (e.g. induced by cytolytic enteroviruses) is characterized by intense virus replication and myocyte necrosis and usually lasts for only a few days.266 Thus, early antiviral 
therapy directed against an identified virus is a potential therapeutic 
avenue to stop the development of viral myocarditis. The evidence 
on clinical application of antiviral agents is limited, and antiviral treatments should be agreed upon with an infectious disease expert as 
part of the IMPS team. 
Patients with AM show significant activation of the NLR family pyrin 
domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the heart, thus it is a 
potential therapeutic target in the acute phase of myocarditis.267 
Activation of NLRP3 functions as a rapid inducer of an inflammatory response through the production of IL-1β and IL-18. Theoretically, promising agents are anti-IL-1 agents (anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab) and 
colchicine,267 although human data on the effect of such agents in myocarditis are still limited. 
In humans, the first evidence has been reported using anakinra, an 
IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) that improved heart function in selected cases of AM refractory to standard treatment. However, in 
the ARAMIS trial, anakinra failed to demonstrate a benefit in patients 
with suspected AM without a specific aetiology (NCT03018834).268 
The primary endpoint was the number of days alive free from any complication due to AM. The study had potential limitations related to the 
limited sample size, the inclusion of a low-risk population, and the short 
follow-up, but it proved that anakinra was safe in this setting. 
Regarding modulation of the immune response, further randomized 
studies are needed to assess treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) in AM for adults,269 since case series and retrospective analyses suggest a benefit in terms of transplant-free survival. Intravenous 
immunoglobulins are commonly prescribed in paediatric patients.269 In 
general, treatment of AM with corticosteroids is controversial, with the 
exception of ICI-induced myocarditis270 and EM.271

The efficacy of combined immunosuppression (prednisone with either cyclosporine or azathioprine), compared with placebo, was assessed in a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) in patients with 
biopsy-proven AM of unspecified aetiology, since infectious causes 
were not excluded by PCR.272 The trial was designed to determine 
whether immunosuppressive therapy improved LV function in patients 
with AM. There was no significant difference in survival between the 
two groups (P = 0.96). The study had several limitations, such as small 
sample size and incomplete analysis of EMB based only on histopathology. However, in specific histopathological forms of AM, such as 
GCM, immunosuppressive drugs are recommended (see Sections 9.2 
and 9.3). 
6.2.1.4. Subacute and chronic myocarditis 
Chronic myocarditis may represent an intermediate stage between 
subacute myocarditis and inflammatory CMP. During chronic myocarditis, HF may develop, and guideline-directed medical therapy 
(GDMT) for HF is the cornerstone in the treatment of chronic myocarditis.12,259 Antiviral therapy has little benefit in the subacute and 
chronic stages of myocarditis,273 and the effects of immunomodulatory drugs on chronic myocarditis of unspecified aetiology are still 
controversial. 
6.2.2. Pharmacological therapy for pericarditis 
6.2.2.1. General principles 
The aims of medical therapy for pericarditis are to provide: (i) symptomatic care (mainly control of pericarditis chest pain); (ii) clinical remission; and (iii) prevention of complications, especially recurrences 
and constriction. 
Exercise restriction limits the heart rate and may be useful to reduce 
pericardial friction, which can be improved using drugs that reduce it 
(e.g. β-blockers or ivabradine for those who cannot receive or tolerate 
β-blockers) for patients with a resting heart rate of >75 b.p.m., and 
symptoms despite empirical anti-inflammatory therapy.274 
6.2.2.1.1. Acute pericarditis (first episode). The mainstay of medical 
therapy is empirical anti-inflammatory therapy using aspirin or NSAIDs 
at full anti-inflammatory doses with appropriate time intervals of administration (usually every 8 h) plus colchicine to reduce the risk of recurrences.24,25,108,275–278 Gastroprotection with a proton pump 
inhibitor is recommended using NSAIDs.279 
When aspirin and NSAIDs are contraindicated, or for specific indications, corticosteroids should be considered at low to moderate doses 
plus colchicine (see Tables 13 and 14). 
In cases of incomplete response to aspirin/NSAIDs and colchicine, 
corticosteroids may be added at low to moderate doses as triple therapy.1 In cases of recurrence, every effort should be made not to increase the dose or to reinstate corticosteroids. 
The use of colchicine on top of empirical anti-inflammatory therapy 
is supported by most of the published evidence, with the single exception of a small open-label trial that was probably underpowered to 
test the study hypothesis for patients with AP.281 Specific dosing 
and duration of therapy are summarized in Table 13. Monitoring of 
serum C-reactive protein and CMR imaging is recommended to assess 
clinical remission, guide the treatment length, and evaluate the response to therapy in more complicated and difficult-to-treat cases. 
In uncomplicated cases, clinical follow-up with/without echocardiography is sufficient. 
6.2.2.2. Incessant and recurrent pericarditis 
In patients with incessant pericarditis or RP, the mainstay of therapy 
is always colchicine in association with aspirin/NSAID or low to 
moderate doses of corticosteroids. For more difficult cases, chest 
pain can be controlled by a combination of aspirin or an NSAID 
plus corticosteroids at low to moderate doses and colchicine (triple 
therapy). The i.v. route should be considered to ensure a clinical response or to control symptoms in more difficult or resistant cases.

Patients who develop a recurrence during corticosteroid tapering 
should continue colchicine and receive an NSAID on top of this treatment instead of increasing the dose of corticosteroids. Which medication should be tapered first (corticosteroids or NSAID) depends on the 
specific clinical scenario (age, kidney function, haemorrhagic risk, and 
use of oral anticoagulants). 
For patients with corticosteroid dependence, colchicine resistance, 
and evidence of elevated C-reactive protein (baseline or subsequent 
episode), clinical trials and an international registry supported the use 
of an anti-IL-1 agent (anakinra or rilonacept).108,275,282–284 An 
advantage of these agents is the rapid onset of action and the possibility 
of rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids.285 There is evidence of efficacy 
with anti-IL-1 agent (anakinra or rilonacept) monotherapy.108,275,282–284 
However, concomitant use of colchicine could be helpful to reduce recurrences and prolong recurrence-free survival, providing a sequential 
block of the pro-inflammatory pathway leading to the generation of 
IL-1.286 Colchicine should be maintained and withdrawn as the last 
drug only after stable remission. Moreover, colchicine has the safest cardiovascular profile and is now proposed to prevent major adverse cardiac 
events (MACE) in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.248 In patients obtaining stable remission with a chronic low dose 
of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone ≤5 mg or equivalent) plus colchicine, 
the decision of switching to IL-1 blocker treatment should be tailored to 
the patient on an individualized basis, taking into account several parameters (such as tolerability, age and sex issues, patient preference). 
The use of anti-IL-1 agents may be associated with a moderate increase 
in the overall risk of mild to moderate infections. Safety data on anti-IL-1 
agents are reassuring when considering new malignancy risk, whereas 
their safe administration in patients with known active malignancies has 
not been well investigated to date. 
There is limited evidence for other drugs for pericarditis. 
Azathioprine has been empirically used in patients with recurrences 
and a lack of response to first- and second-level options such as aspirin/NSAID, colchicine, and corticosteroids.287 However, this drug 
seems more appropriate as a steroid-sparing agent, and has limited efficacy for those with acute pain. Intravenous immunoglobulins have 
also been tested in patients with refractory RP after failure of first 
and second options, as well as anti-IL-1 agents. These drugs may be 
efficacious either for infectious or non-infectious aetiologies, since 
they are able to clear infectious agents and modulate the immune 
response.288 Both corticosteroids and immunoglobulins have been

aTherapy duration as initial dosing; for all treatments the attack dose is maintained until symptom resolution and normalization of inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein) and other 
investigations (electrocardiogram, echocardiogram) then tapering is recommended. It should be tailored to the single patient according to disease severity and patient response. Tapering is 
especially important for corticosteroids where tapering is particularly slow, especially below 15 mg/day, the common threshold for recurrences (see Table 14). Monitoring is essentially based 
on the assessment of blood count, creatinine, creatine kinase, transaminases, C-reactive protein, echocardiography. Anakinra should be tapered after clinical remission. Different schemes are 
adopted: e.g. reducing one dose per week every month; every other day full dose for at least 3 months then half-dose every other day for at least 3 months. 
bAspirin and ibuprofen are common first-level treatments for the first episode of pericarditis (acute pericarditis) associated with colchicine for at least 3 months. Aspirin is the preferred 
choice for patients with ischaemic heart disease. Indomethacin is usually considered for incessant/recurrent cases. In incessant/recurrent cases, colchicine is maintained for at least 
6 months. Aspirin/NSAID full dose is recommended for patients with normal or mildly reduced renal function. For those with moderate to severe renal impairment, dose adjustment or 
use of corticosteroids is recommended. 
cRilonacept is registered in the USA but is not currently available in Europe. Anakinra, due to its short half-life, may be the preferable choice in patients at increased risk of infections.

inflammatory phenotype).288,289 
More recently, hydroxychloroquine has shown a steroid-sparing effect and increased flare-free survival in RP in patients with colchicine resistance and corticosteroid dependence.290 Treatment duration with 
aspirin/NSAIDs and steroids should be extended in an individualized 
manner, and the tapering process should be slower than for a first episode of AP.1

6.3. Interventional techniques including 
circulatory support 
6.3.1. Myocarditis 
6.3.1.1. Short-term mechanical circulatory support 
Myocarditis patients who present with rapid deterioration in haemodynamic status and rapidly progressive myocardial dysfunction are 
amongst those who respond best to temporary MCS.293 Among temporary MCS, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(VA-ECMO) represents the most frequently applied or recommended 
approach, ranging from 75% to 85% of AM cases.75,294–296 Despite the 
high risk and markedly compromised state of patients undergoing 
VA-ECMO support for FM, the prognosis is rather favourable, with a 
high rate of myocardial recovery and patient survival. Several national 
and international multicentre studies showed in-hospital survival ranging from 61% to 72%,297–300 but no freedom from HT in patients 
with giant-cell FM.294 Temporary MCS should be performed early 
and in a timely manner in patients with FM with refractory cardiogenic 
shock because of the high likelihood of recovery. 
6.3.1.2. Intra-aortic balloon pump 
As mentioned, EMB should be performed as soon as possible, even in 
the presence of temporary MCS,212,295 and specific immunosuppressive therapy should be considered at least as an initial option, while determining the myocardial response.295 An intra-aortic balloon pump 
(IABP) should be considered in cardiogenic shock as first-line MCS 
with prompt escalation to more powerful MCS if haemodynamic and 
end-organ perfusion improvement is not observed within a short 
time (1 h maximum).295 
6.3.2. Pericarditis 
Pericardium-related interventional procedures are increasingly applied 
and require specific expertise.1,301 The use of percutaneous interventional techniques for pericarditis is not limited to perform percutaneous drainage, but also to obtain fluid samples for cytology and other 
pathological examinations (see Supplementary data online, Table S7). 
Moreover, interventional techniques are used to provide alternative 
treatment, such as balloon pericardiotomy or, less commonly, intrapericardial drug administration (e.g. corticosteroids or chemotherapy).

not responding to medical therapy, or when a search for aetiological 
agents is needed (e.g. suspicion of cancer, bacterial infection). 
Whenever possible, pericardiocentesis should not drain a large amount 
of pericardial fluid (usually <500 mL) to prevent pericardial decompression syndrome. Complete drainage of the PEff can be achieved, 
leaving a drain to be removed when the daily drainage is <30 mL. 
Surgical drainage is required when percutaneous pericardiocentesis is 
not feasible or purulent effusion is present, to allow complete drainage 
of the effusion and prevent its organization. Clinical triage has been proposed to indicate urgent management.118 An overall score of >6 indicates the need for urgent pericardiocentesis, whereas a lower score 
suggests delaying the intervention (see Figure 12). 
Imaging is an essential component for guiding percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Under echocardiography, CT, or fluoroscopic guidance, 
a needle (usually 16–20 gauge) should be introduced into the sub- 
xyphoid space, although an apical or left-lateral approach might be 
used. The catheter should usually remain in situ for a few days, also 
based on the type and efficacy of concomitant systemic and/or topic 
pharmacological treatment.1 
6.3.2.2. Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy 
Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy represents a percutaneous alternative to the endoscopic or surgical pleuro-pericardial window, which allows relapsing pericardial fluid to be absorbed through the ample pleural 
serosa, especially as palliative and temporary relief.1 It should not be used 
as a first- or second-line intervention, but rather reserved for very rare 
cases, such as recurrent neoplastic PEff and CTP, as well as for absolute 
contraindications for surgery or in the case of a very poor quality of life in 
terminal patients (see Supplementary data online, Table S8).1 
6.3.2.3. Intrapericardial drug administration 
Percutaneous access to the pericardium is done using an intrapericardial 
catheter following pericardial drainage. It may be used to deliver drugs 
targeting different conditions. Anti-inflammatory agents have been delivered with some efficacy. Intrapericardial crystalloid triamcinolone, 
300 mg/m2 of body surface, can be used for autoreactive or recurrent 
PEffs that do not respond to other conventional therapies, and to avoid 
or limit systemic side effects of oral corticosteroids. Chemotherapeutics 
have also been delivered, such as cisplatin and thiotepa (usually for lung 
and breast cancer, respectively), with demonstrated reduction of PEff relapse.302–304 Currently, due to improved chemotherapy, the systemic 
route is favoured, and therapeutic planning should involve a multidisciplinary team with cardiologists and oncologists. 
Sclerosing agents, such as talc, to enhance pericardium–epicardium 
adherence and to reduce relapsing PEff, should not be used, because 
of reduced efficacy compared with a pericardial window or pericardiectomy, and the risk of inducing constriction.305,306 
6.3.2.4. Pericardioscopy 
This procedure is sometimes considered as part of the diagnostic work- 
up, allowing pericardial biopsy. Pericardial access is also increasingly 
used for mapping and ablation of the epicardial substrates of VA, 
with an improved success rate and avoidance of a surgical procedure. 
6.3.2.5. Pericardial fluid analysis, pericardial and epicardial biopsy 
Percutaneous pericardial access may be used also to provide fluid samples 
for pathological and pathogen examinations (bacterial or viral aetiology), 
and/or to perform pericardial as well as epicardial biopsies, particularly 
in cancer screening (see Supplementary data online, Table S7).1 
6.3.2.6. Circulatory support 
Mechanical circulatory support has been shown to be applied in up to 
12% of pericardiectomy patients with pre-procedural RV dilatation/ 
dysfunction,307–309 and is sometimes considered peri-operatively.307– 
309 The association of pre-procedural RV dilatation/dysfunction and reduced LV function also represent risk factors for a peri-procedural risk 
of early mortality, calling for timely and prophylactic MCS.308 
6.4. Surgical therapy 
6.4.1. Myocarditis 
The surgical treatment of myocarditis mainly accounts for HT, when there 
is no myocardial recovery. In addition to infective or autoimmune aetiologies, radiation-induced myopericarditis (usually secondary to haematological cancer) may contribute to the indications for such an 
intervention. Limited series of HTs due to radiation-induced myocarditis 
have been described with satisfactory results. Secondary malignancy, lung 
and kidney failure are negative prognostic factors for post-operative morbidity and mortality.310 A durable ventricular assist device (VAD) or a total 
artificial heart are other alternatives for advanced cardiac support.295 
6.4.2. Pericarditis 
6.4.2.1. Surgical pericardiocentesis 
Surgical pericardiocentesis is rarely performed for urgent/emergency 
conditions, but for large PEff requiring expeditious drainage, not achievable with percutaneous-based drainage (e.g. for purulent PEff or clot 
aspiration). 
6.4.2.2. Pericardiotomy/pericardial window 
These surgical procedures are carried out to create a connection, namely 
a pleuro-pericardial window, usually between the lateral or left posterior 
pericardium and the left pleura. The indication is relapsing PEff with 
haemodynamic compromise despite conservative treatment or percutaneous drainage. The pleuro-pericardial window is meant to promote drainage from the pericardium to the left pleural space.1 Such a window may be 
created by a small thoracotomy or endoscopically. In selected cases, a 
pericardial window can also be created in the peritoneal cavity.

6.4.2.3. Pericardiectomy 
Pericardiectomy is the mainstay treatment for chronic constriction or 
CP not responding to anti-inflammatory therapy.311 Complete pericardiectomy is recommended for the management of CP, as it offers superior long-term outcomes and significantly reduces the risk of 
recurrences compared with partial anterior or anterophrenic pericardiectomy, which may leave residual constrictive tissue and contribute 
to persistent or recurrent symptoms. Due to the relative rarity of 
the condition, and the complexity of patients, pericardiectomy should 
be performed at high-volume centres that have the required expertise. 
Early pericardiectomy within 6 months after the onset of symptoms is 
associated with the lowest operative mortality.312,313 The occurrence of 
refractory RP and/or pericardial fluid formation, despite optimal medical 
and interventional therapy, is also considered a possible indication for 
surgical pericardiectomy. In the absence of a surgical plane for proper decortication, a pragmatic approach, named the waffle procedure, can be 
considered. This technique utilizes longitudinal and horizontal incisions 
to allow some relief of constriction. However, it usually offers only temporary improvement, with a high rate of recurrent constriction.314,315 
Extracorporeal circulation may be required in difficult operative conditions, such as extensive calcifications with a high risk of marked bleeding 
during pericardiectomy. Previous 2015 ESC guidelines recommended resection ‘of as much as possible’ of the pericardium with avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP), using this only in circumstances of difficult 
control of bleeding.1 Cardiopulmonary bypass can play an important 
role in enabling safe and complete pericardiectomy, particularly in selected complex or high-risk cases. 
Pericardiectomy is commonly performed without CPB. However, 
CPB may be necessary in specific clinical scenarios. These include 
dense adhesions between the pericardium and the myocardium, 
particularly involving the posterior surface of the heart. CPB is 
also indicated in cases of haemodynamic instability during dissection. 
This is especially relevant when heart lifting is required to access the 
diaphragmatic or posterior pericardium. Additional indications 
include calcific constrictive pericarditis with myocardial involvement, challenging anatomical conditions, or the need for concomitant cardiac procedures, such as valve surgery or coronary artery 
bypass grafting. 
Possible benefits of CPB include providing a bloodless field and improved visibility for complete pericardial resection, especially posteriorly, avoiding myocardial injury by decompressing the heart during 
dissection, maintaining haemodynamic stability, particularly in patients 
with borderline cardiac output or tamponade physiology. However, 
the full heparinization required to perform CPB may, in some cases, 
favour bleeding generated by pericardial resection. Therefore, the 
indication for the use of CPB must always be taken into consideration 
intra-operatively and according to the anatomical as well as haemodynamic conditions encountered during the surgical procedure. It is, 
however, self-explanatory that a radical pericardiectomy, including 
also the posterior site of the pericardium, would be usually possible 
and advisable with the application of CPB. However, diaphragmatic 
pericardial resection may often be performed without CPB use, taking 
care to perform resection in a stepwise manner, without prolonging 
heart lifting and avoiding marked haemodynamic compromise. 
Heart transplantation is very rarely indicated in patients with CP. 
However, it may be considered as a last-resort option in highly selected, 
exceptional cases. This applies when pericardiectomy is not feasible or 
cannot be completed due to extensive pericardial calcification with myocardial involvement, prior surgeries, radiation therapy, or infections that 
have caused severe adhesions and scarring. Surgical inaccessibility of 
critical regions, such as the posterior pericardium, may also preclude 
complete resection. In some patients, persistent heart failure symptoms 
and progressive functional deterioration may occur despite maximal 
medical therapy and attempted pericardiectomy. In these cases, heart 
transplantation might be considered. 
It is also an option when coexistent myocardial disease or a mixed constrictive–restrictive physiology is present, where pericardial resection 
would not be expected to improve symptoms or haemodynamic function. 
In CP, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common finding due to chronic elevated right-sided pressures, annular dilation secondary to longstanding volume overload and atrial enlargement, tethering of leaflets 
due to pericardial constraint. When TR is present in patients undergoing pericardiectomy, leaving the valve unrepaired can lead to persistent 
right HF symptoms (e.g. oedema, ascites, fatigue), poorer functional recovery post-operatively, and higher long-term mortality, as shown in 
retrospective observational studies. During pericardiectomy, the tricuspid valve is accessible, and repair (usually annuloplasty) can be safely 
performed with minimal added risk—especially when CP surgery is 
done under CPB. Thus, repair is recommended when TR is more 
than mild, and anatomy is suitable, and the patient is already undergoing 
pericardiectomy (i.e. no added surgery is required beyond access). 
Supporting evidence is limited. While RCTs are lacking, the recommendation is based on retrospective findings showing improved symptom 
relief and outcomes with combined surgery, and surgical principles in 
valve disease management but also the practicality and safety of valve 
repair when the chest is already open.311 
Contraindications for pericardiectomy may include severe hepatic 
dysfunction with cirrhosis and ascites, uncontrolled infection or sepsis, 
and other life-limiting diseases. In some situations, advanced therapy, 
such as HT, might be the only solution due to unfeasible cardiac decortication, because of extensive calcifications or a high risk of cardiac and 
major vascular injury during pericardiectomy (for predictors of outcomes after pericardiectomy see also Supplementary data online, 
Table S8 and Section 3.2). 
6.5. Management of arrhythmias and 
prevention of sudden cardiac death in 
myocarditis 
Patients with myocarditis are known to be vulnerable to life-threatening 
arrhythmias, and careful observation and management of patients according to the risk stratification is needed. In the 2022 ESC Guidelines 
for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death, significant attention was paid to active

and chronic myocarditis.58 In addition to these guidelines, our aim is to 
provide a special focus on several selected scenarios. 
6.5.1. Role of active devices (wearable and implanted 
devices) in acute myocarditis 
In AM, AVB may be reversible, and temporary pacing is often necessary in 
cases of haemodynamic compromise as a bridge to recovery.317 In this 
setting, temporary transvenous external pacing with an active lead can 
be used for patients who require prolonged temporary pacing.86,318– 
320 In the absence of recovery within a clinically reasonable period, definitive cardiac pacing is usually necessary in patients with persistent high- 
degree AVB. In patients with LV dysfunction needing frequent ventricular 
pacing, CRT or conduction system pacing may be helpful.86,321 
Permanent pacemaker placement can be considered in patients with 
AM for persisting high-degree AVB despite medical therapy. 
Sustained VA in the context of AM is a rare phenomenon,79 yet it 
poses a substantial risk of recurrence, persisting even after resolution 
of the acute phase. Studies indicate a high recurrence rate ranging 
from 28% to 60%, which appears higher in patients with monomorphic 
VT, chronically active myocarditis, anteroseptal LGE, and reduced 
LVEF.71,79,89,222,322–325 In myocarditis patients, polymorphic and irregular 
VA are more common during the active inflammatory phase, whereas 
monomorphic and regular VA are associated with healed myocarditis 
and scars.79,83,325 An arrhythmic presentation may raise suspicion of an 
underlying inherited CMP.95 GCM is associated with a high risk of life- 
threatening VA and ICD implantation can be considered.326 The use of 
a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) is feasible in selected patients with AM at higher risk of VA, when waiting for recovery or with 
a temporary contraindication for ICD.327–330 The resolution of inflammation does not necessarily indicate the absence of risk, because myocardial fibrosis may constitute an arrhythmogenic substrate, 
predisposing a patient to VA long after the acute episode. On this basis, 
arrhythmia risk stratification should be performed in patients with persistent LGE after the acute phase.325 In patients with prior myocarditis, 
sustained or non-sustained VT during an exercise test performed 
6 months after the acute episode was found to be more common among 
those with an arrhythmic presentation, and was associated with subsequent adverse events, including malignant VA.331 Late gadolinium enhancement was also identified as a significant predictor of adverse 
events, including malignant arrhythmias, irrespective of LVEF, especially 
in an anteroseptal location.332–334 Implantable loop recorders can be useful for early detection of VA in selected patients.89 Details regarding oral 
anticoagulation can be found in the 2019 ESC Guidelines for the management of patients with supraventricular tachycardia, the 2022 ESC 
Guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias 
and the prevention of sudden cardiac death, and the 2024 ESC 
Guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation.58,260,261 
7. Prognosis 
The current literature focuses on the single condition, but one could 
expect that a patient with concomitant involvement of the myocardium 
and pericardium will have a worse prognosis. However, current published evidence suggests that patients with uncomplicated pericarditis 
and myopericarditis have a good overall prognosis, despite combined 
involvement of the pericardium and myocardium.4,337 The TF expects 
that the introduction of the term IMPS will increase awareness and will 
lead to dedicated studies in this regard. 
7.1. Complications and outcomes for 
myocarditis 
One of the main prognostic factors is the initial clinical presentation of 
myocarditis (Figure 8). Low-risk myocarditis (about 75% of unselected 
cases) usually has a chest pain presentation with preserved biventricular 
function, and an overall benign short- and long-term prognosis.28 Acute 
complicated myocarditis with arrhythmic presentation, and especially 
HF presentation, has a worse prognosis.56 There is conflicting evidence

on the role of sex in the prognosis of IMPS.73 Women seem to have a 
more favourable prognosis than men in myocarditis.338 Young age and a 
previous myocarditis were independent relapse predictors. Fulminant 
onset, lower LVEF at presentation, distinct autoimmune features, especially in women, and high-titre organ-specific anti-heart autoantibodies 
and antinuclear autoantibodies were independent predictors of death 
and HT.73 Genetic predisposition may also increase the risk (see 
Section 5.3). 
The aetiology also plays a relevant role, e.g. EM, GCM and CS are 
associated with a worse prognosis (Sections 9.2–9.4). Outcomes are 
worse in patients with FM, in the case of late diagnosis and delayed 
interventions.57 Factors associated with increased mortality or HT 
are GCM, QRS duration of >120 ms on initial ECG, or the need 
for temporary MCS other than IABP.56 Biventricular dysfunction 
has been described as the main predictor of death or HT in 
myocarditis.63,66,73 
Multimodality imaging contributes to the assessment of prognosis. 
For example, myocarditis patients with normal CMR have a good 
prognosis.339 Late gadolinium enhancement on CMR at initial presentation is an important prognostic finding.340 In a multicentre study 
with AM and preserved EF, the presence of anteroseptal LGE in 
the mid-wall layer was the best independent predictor of the combined endpoint of cardiac death, appropriate ICD interventions, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and hospitalization for HF [odds ratio 
(OR) 2.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–5.9; P = .01]. At a median 
follow-up of 4.3 years, 7.7% of these patients reached the combined 
endpoint.3 Anteroseptal LGE was the best independent predictor 
of SCD [hazard ratio (HR) 4.59; 95% CI 1.38–15.24; P = .01]. 
Myocardial fibrosis was present in 95% of patients with SCD, compared with 41% in patients without SCD.341 Additionally, major arrhythmic onset (sustained VT or VF), presence of fibrosis at EMB, 
and induction of major VA on PVS all predicted major arrhythmic 
events.63,73,255 
In another study, including patients with AM and life-threatening 
arrhythmias, positive LGE in two or more myocardial segments 
and absence of oedema on initial CMR were associated with an increased risk for recurrent major arrhythmic events, including SCD 
[HR 4.51 (95% CI 2.39–8.53) and HR 2.59 (95% CI 1.40–4.79), 
respectively].71 
Large studies are needed in the future to develop a risk stratification 
with a high negative predictive value for SCD and the need for ICD implantation. Variables for risk stratification for the progression to DCM 
are given in Supplementary data online, Table S9. 
7.1.1. Sequela and mortality in myocarditis 
The main long-term complications are evolution to DCM with subsequent HF and (recurrence of) VA, including SCD.76 LVEF recovery after myocarditis can be complete or partial. Recovery rates 
vary from 50% to 94% depending on the initial presentation.74 
These patients usually have a gradual deterioration of LVEF and 
subsequent dilation and might remain unrecognized and asymptomatic until development of overt HF. Myocarditis can cause 
about 10% of DCM.66 Patients with B19V AM present most often 
with an infarct-like syndrome, and may have a favourable long-term 
prognosis,342 but there is evidence describing cases with severe 
fatal outcomes.228 In contrast, patients with HHV-6 myocarditis 
(and especially those with B19V and HHV-6 co-infection) usually 
present with acute HF symptoms, and frequently progress to 
chronic HF.342 
Arrhythmias during myocarditis range from mild conduction abnormalities to life-threatening VT or VF, requiring medication and/ 
or device therapy (refer to Section 6.5). The risk of VA is independent 
of LVEF.83,343 
Myocarditis may have a significant mortality. Initial complicated 
presentation and histological subtype predict the risk. Outcomes 
are worse in patients with FM, with a reported mortality at 60 days 
of 24%.56,73 Mortality also depends on the underlying cause of FM. 
In a study of GCM survivors beyond 1 year, the combined rate of 
death, HT, VAD implantation, or GCM recurrence was 47% at 
5 years.344 Reported in-hospital mortality and long-term outcomes 
after an episode of AM vary.345 In a multicentre registry of patients 
with AM, complicated AM occurred in 27%, including 9% cases of 
FM. In-hospital mortality was 8.5%, compared with 0% in uncomplicated cases. Heart transplantation or LVAD was required in 
3% and 4% of patients, respectively. Heart transplantation or death 
occurred in 18% of complicated cases after 5 years. Recurrences 
or VA occurred in approximately 3%–9% of cases over a period 
of 19–90 months.28 In the recently reported contemporary ESC 
multicentre myocarditis registry of 581 patients with myocarditis, 
2.7% of patients died, 1.7% received a HT, 0.7% underwent VAD 
implantation, and 3.9% underwent ICD implantation at 1-year 
follow-up.62,63,73 
7.1.2. Follow-up 
Patients with low-risk myocarditis with chest pain presentation can be 
discharged when cardiac enzymes tend towards normalization. Time 
to recovery in AM varies from a few days to a few months. Relapses 
occur in about 10% of cases, with a 1-year recurrence rate of around 
5%.10,73,346 
Follow-up is recommended in all patients with myocarditis, with 
clinical assessment, ECG, Holter-ECG registration, exercise test (if 
no signs of ongoing inflammation), echocardiography, and CMR within 
at least 6 months after the index hospitalization (see Table 15).10,62 
The prognosis is determined by baseline and 6-month LV function, regardless of the initial clinical presentation.62,63,73 Cardiovascular magnetic resonance should be performed at least within the first 
6 months in patients with definite myocarditis to guide the timepoint 
for return to work, based on the individual case. 
It is generally accepted to wait 3–6 months after an acute episode 
of myocarditis to evaluate the need for an ICD. In some patients at 
high risk for VA (see Section 6.5.1),71 a WCD should be considered 
during follow-up as a bridge to recovery.58 Subsequently, after 
3–6 months of follow-up, the decision on whether or not to implant 
a definitive ICD is based on the individual patient, with increasing indication based on risk factors including genetic predisposition (see 
Section 5.3, Section 6.5.1; see Figure 17). In patients presenting with 
symptomatic VA, or heart block in GCM or CS, early consideration 
of an ICD is warranted.58 Recommendations concerning arrhythmias 
and SCD in specific forms of myocarditis are discussed in Section 6.5.58 
In uncomplicated cases, a follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 months is sufficient, while it should be prolonged and be lifelong in complicated cases 
or with residuals. 
See Supplementary data online, Section 8 for patient communication 
advice.

7.2. Complications and outcomes for 
pericarditis 
Risk stratification of patients with pericarditis must be performed at the 
initial presentation at the emergency department or in an ambulatory 
setting. Admission is recommended in high-risk cases.105,130 
Non-high-risk cases can be managed as outpatients with a close follow- 
up within 1 to 2 weeks (Figure 7). ECG changes (mainly widespread 
ST-segment elevation) and troponin elevation were usually not negative 
prognostic markers in this setting with an infarct-like presentation and 
preserved biventricular function.4,35 
In the real world, approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with AP 
present with at least one predictor of poor prognosis and require hospitalization.130 The in-hospital mortality rate for AP is around 1% on 
average, but can be higher in older patients and those with severe 
co-infections.23 
According to the clinical presentation, additional diagnostic work-up 
should be performed only for a specific clinical suspicion, the presence 
of high-risk features, or a lack/incomplete response to empirical anti- 
inflammatory therapy (Table 16). 
The usual course of AP is characterized by clinical remission 
after medical therapy within 4–6 weeks. The most common and 
problematic complication of pericarditis is RP, which affects 
20%–30% of patients not treated with colchicine. About 10% of 
patients may present with continued symptoms without clinical remission. Such cases have been labelled as ‘incessant’, and may directly progress to constriction in few months,104 while this 
complication is extremely rare in idiopathic RP.114,347 A course 
with multiple recurrences is possible, but not usual in simple presumed viral pericarditis, and should prompt a search for an underlying cause (Figure 14). 
Cardiac tamponade is relatively rare in AP, as well as CP (<1% of 
cases). The risk for complications is related to the aetiology. For instance, the risk of CP is low after presumed viral/idiopathic pericarditis, 
intermediate for immune-mediated aetiologies, as well as PCIS and neoplastic pericarditis (2%–5%), and high for bacterial pericarditis (20%– 
30%), especially if purulent.347 
At least three scores43,44,348 have been proposed recently to identify patients at increased risk of developing complicated pericarditis 
and chronicity, requiring close follow-up (see Supplementary data 
online, Tables S2 and S3). However, these scores have not been validated or replicated in additional larger studies, and remain 
investigational.

### 8 Inflammatory myopericardial

syndrome overlapping types: 
myopericarditis and 
perimyocarditis 
IMPS includes a spectrum of inflammatory diseases from isolated myocarditis to isolated pericarditis through a combination of both. IMPS 
should be used as an umbrella term, also covering overlapping forms 
of myocarditis and pericarditis.1 The diagnosis of predominant pericarditis with myocardial involvement, or ‘myopericarditis’, can be clinically 
established if patients with definite criteria for AP show elevated biomarkers of myocardial injury, without newly developed focal or diffuse 
impairment of LV function on TTE or CMR. The term myopericarditis 
indicates a primarily pericarditic syndrome with minor myocardial involvement, which describes the majority of combined pericarditis and 
myocarditis cases encountered in clinical practice. On the other 
hand, evidence of new-onset focal or diffuse reduction of LV function 
in patients with elevated myocardial biomarkers, and clinical criteria 
for AP, suggests predominant myocarditis with pericardial involvement,

termed ‘perimyocarditis’. The clinical management and outcomes of 
mixed forms follow the predominant involvement. At present, patients 
with myopericarditis can be treated as patients with pericarditis, while 
patients with perimyocarditis should be managed as patients with pure 
myocarditis. The knowledge in the field is rapidly evolving and ongoing 
trials and evidence will provide more updated guidance for clinical 
management. 
A common scenario with overlapping forms of myocarditis and pericarditis is represented by systemic immune disorders, which can affect 
either the myocardium or pericardium, or both. 
Several systemic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may present 
with myocarditis, pericarditis, mixed forms, or PEff without pericarditis. 
Main conditions include RA, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, SSc, polymyositis 
and dermatomyositis, and vasculitis (e.g. particularly EGPA). 
8.1. Inflammatory myopericardial 
syndrome in systemic disorders 
Inflammatory myopericardial syndrome may complicate several types 
of systemic diseases, generally immune-mediated,349,350 either with 
myocardial (myocarditis) or pericardial involvement (pericarditis and/ 
or PEff). Symptoms and signs that may raise the suspicion of a rheumatic autoimmune disease are family history, history of low-grade fever, 
joint symptoms, dry eyes and mouth, headache, lymphadenopathy, 
Raynaud phenomenon, skin rash, oral and genital aphthae, deep or 
superficial vein thrombosis, recurrent foetal losses, lymphopenia, and 
chronic increase of CK and other inflammatory markers. Targeted 
therapy should be applied, if a specific diagnosis is reached during the 
diagnostic work-up. 
8.1.1. Rheumatoid arthritis 
Pericarditis can be seen as part of the inflammatory activity in RA, and is 
often present concurrently with pleuritis. It is the most common cardiac 
manifestation, affecting up to 50% of patients, as detected on post- 
mortem examination. Myocarditis may also be present, and generally resolves if the disease is controlled.351 Anakinra, already registered for the 
treatment of RA, can be used also for related pericardial involvement. 
8.1.2. Systemic lupus erythematosus 
Pericarditis is the most common cardiac manifestation of SLE, reported 
in approximately 25% of patients, and it is included in the American 
Rheumatism Association/American College of Rheumatology (ARA/ 
ACR) classification criteria.352 Myocardial involvement in SLE affects 
about 5% of patients.353,354,355 Symptoms of IMPS are often non- 
specific, including elevated troponin, alterations on the ECG, LVEF abnormalities, and PEff. These manifestations are usually associated with 
typical symptoms of SLE, including fever, arthritis, nephritis, and skin 
rashes.356,357 The diagnosis can be supported by specific laboratory 
markers, as well as multimodality imaging, to guide the therapy.358,359 
Endomyocardial biopsy could be rarely considered in selected cases.349 
Cardiac tamponade occurs in less than 2% of cases, and CP is extremely 
rare. Cardiomyopathy is uncommon clinically, but autopsy studies 
found myocardial involvement in 40%–50% of patients. 
8.1.3. Antiphospholipid syndrome 
Antiphospholipid syndrome is associated with the presence of 
anti-cardiolipin and/or anti-β2-glycoprotein antibodies, and/or lupus 
anticoagulant, and may be the cause of myocardial dysfunction through 
various mechanisms. While myocarditis can manifest in this syndrome, 
mediated by autoimmune mechanism, myocardial damage can be also 
caused by microthrombotic phenomena.360,361 
8.1.4. Sjögren’s syndrome 
In Sjögren’s syndrome, the most common clinical manifestation of cardiac 
damage is pericarditis, which has been reported in less than one-third of 
cases. Myocarditis and myocardial fibrosis are also possible,362 and may 
occur associated with rhythm disturbances. Specific antibodies 
(anti-Ro/SSA) could also be identified in unexplained heart blocks.363 
8.1.5. Systemic sclerosis 
Inflammatory myopericardial syndrome is frequent in SSc,364 often clinically occult and, when symptomatic, the prognosis is poor. It may be 
related to ventricular dysfunction and/or structural damage of the 
microvascular bed, leading to repeated focal ischaemic injuries and irreversible myocardial fibrosis. It can be also due to a primary systemic 
myositic disease.349,365 Damage usually follows two pathways.366 The 
first one is linked to the production of collagen by activated fibroblasts 
at the myopericardial level, especially at the subepicardial level, with 
consequent fibrosis, valve stenosis, coronary spasms, and ischaemic 
events. The second pathway is caused by renal and pulmonary involvement, with severe cardiac consequences.367,368 Further research is 
needed to improve the understanding of IMPS in SSc.364 
8.1.6. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis 
The myocardium can be affected in inflammatory myopathies, such as 
polymyositis and dermatomyositis,369 with consequent myocardial 
hypertrophy, ischaemia, cardiac enlargement, and systolic and diastolic 
ventricular dysfunction.370 Cardiac involvement in inflammatory myopathies is clinically occult in most patients, but may be suspected by multimodality imaging371,372 and is related to poor outcome.370,372 
Myocarditis occurs in up to 30% of autopsied patients, with or without 
concomitant coronary or vessel vasculitis. Pericarditis is rarely reported 
in these patients. 
8.1.7. Vasculitis 
Myocardial involvement is prognostically relevant in vasculitis, particularly EGPA. In EGPA, about 15%–60% of patients present with cardiac 
disease350 including PEff, conduction disturbances, and motion abnormalities, as well as ACS, often due to coronary spasm, and EM (see 
Section 9.2). While cardiac involvement in EGPA often occurs early, it 
can be late in the course of the disease, and mainly affects anti- 
neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-negative patients with high 
eosinophil counts. Myocardial and pericardial involvement is also possible in other vasculitis, especially in Kawasaki’s disease, where myocarditis is a common cardiovascular complication (see Supplementary data 
online, Figure S3).373 
Cooperation with specialists is important in all these systemic conditions to reach the correct diagnosis and to plan appropriate treatment. 
The diagnosis of EGPA may be particularly challenging.349 
8.2. Inflammatory myopericardial 
syndrome in COVID-19 disease 
The COVID-19 pandemic raised the awareness of IMPS, as in many patients the myocardium as well as the pericardium were affected. It is not 
proven whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly damage cardiomyocytes or pericardiocytes, as it was suggested in cultivated human cardiomyocytes.374 Autopsy studies could only detect small amounts of virus  
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               49

in the myocardium and pericardium.375–379 The true estimate of 
COVID-19-associated IMPS is variable depending on CMR/ 
EMB-derived diagnosis ranging from 0.1–4.5/1000 cases380,381 up to 
2%–8% of cases in symptomatic patients.382 Symptoms as well as diagnostic work-up are similar to those described for general IMPS (see 
Sections 4 and 5). 
The predominant management of symptomatic complicated 
SARS-CoV-2-related IMPS is antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 virus 
together with supportive therapy. Several immunosuppressive therapies, such as anti-IL-1 (anakinra and canakinumab) and anti-IL-6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab), have demonstrated promising results in critically ill 
patients hospitalized for COVID-19.383–385 In less severe cases, the key 
elements for treatments are those recommended for IMPS. More details can be found in Supplementary data online, Section 5.1.2. 
9. Specific types of myocarditis 
9.1. Lymphocytic myocarditis 
The diagnosis of LM is based on pathological criteria and reflects an inflammatory disease that may be caused by viruses, but also by other infectious agents, including bacteria (such as Borrelia spp.) and protozoa 
(such as T. cruzi).10 Furthermore, contemporary single-centre and multicentre cohort studies suggest that LM is more commonly non-infectious 
or immune-mediated/autoimmune.63,73 It is important to note that the 
aetiopathogenesis and outcome of viral LM varies considerably, based 
on the different infections. Cytolytic viruses, such as enteroviruses (e.g. 
coxsackieviruses and echoviruses), destroy cardiomyocytes and induce 
severe infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes.386 In contrast to enteroviruses, vasculotropic B19V, which infects cardiac endothelial cells, 
but not cardiomyocytes, can also induce severe LM, especially in young 
children.228,387 High viral copy numbers (>500 viral DNA copies/µg of 
cardiac DNA) were found to be associated with cardiac inflammation 
and/or systemic infection.228,388 Low B19V DNA copy numbers in cardiac tissue rather reflect virus persistence, and are usually not related 
to cardiac inflammation. Lymphotropic viruses of the Herpesviridae family 
[HHV-6, EBV, human cytomegalovirus (CMV)], as well as HCV, influenza 
viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 may indirectly trigger myocarditis by activating 
the immune system.389 Regarding the aetiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis, microRNAs (miRNAs) may be promising diagnostic markers, as 
well as prognostic and therapeutic targets in myocarditis.141,390 
However, the precise role of miRNAs in myocarditis remains to be determined.391 In addition to infectious agents, organ-specific autoimmunity to heart autoantigens,66 different systemic immune-mediated 
diseases, toxic substances, and drugs, including ICIs, are known to induce 
different forms of acute and chronic LM.66 Immune-mediated myocarditis may occur with exclusive cardiac involvement or in the context of systemic immune-mediated diseases, such as SLE, SSc, and others.349,392 
Interestingly, genetic host susceptibilities have also been linked to cardiac 
dysfunction following myocarditis.91,150 
9.1.1. Presentation 
Since LM can be induced by various causes, there is no universal, specific 
clinical presentation. Instead, it must be considered in the context of 
the different diseases, in line with the stages of myocarditis. 
9.1.2. Diagnosis and therapy 
The diagnostic pathways were described above and vary depending on 
the cause. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach has to follow the 
clinical situation and the stages as described in Section 4 (see Table 12). 
9.2. Eosinophilic myocarditis 
Eosinophilic myocarditis is a rare form of myocarditis, characterized by 
eosinophilic infiltration of the myocardium. Underlying disorders that 
should be evaluated during the work-up of EM include: hypersensitivity 
and allergic reactions;271 immune-mediated disorders, in particular 
EGPA; undefined complex HES or its myeloproliferative variant; parasitic infections; and cancer.349 A meta-analysis of single cases or small 
case series reported a rate of in-hospital death of up to 22%, and a significantly increased occurrence of the hypersensitivity form, up to 
36%.271 
9.2.1. Presentation 
The clinical presentation of EM can be variable, ranging from oligosymptomatic to acute FM, or chronic RCM (Loeffler CMP or endomyocarditis).271 Nevertheless, prior study demonstrates that EM often has a 
fulminant presentation with abrupt impairment of LVEF, a high risk of 
malignant arrhythmias, and a high risk of thromboembolic complications, related to the formation of ventricular thrombi.271 Although 
EM is often accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia, it should be noted 
that this finding is absent in up to 25% of patients with EM, and may contribute to the underdiagnosis of EM. 
9.2.2. Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of EM can be established by either the EMB-proven presence of eosinophilic infiltration of the myocardium, or the presence of 
CMR-proven myocarditis with pathognomonic findings associated with 
peripheral eosinophilia (Supplementary data online, Figure S3). 
Furthermore, general clinical signs related to EGPA or HES disorders 
should be evaluated, such as an increased number of eosinophilic cells, 
history of asthma and sinusitis, and characteristic skin lesions. Left ventricular function may be preserved, and DCM can occur, but often the 
phenotype of RCM is present. On echocardiography, a typical finding is 
Loeffler endocarditis. In the diagnostic work-up, systemic screening for 
the above-mentioned aetiologies should be carried out systematically. 
9.2.3. Therapy 
The first-line therapy for EM is the administration of i.v. corticosteroids, 
but caution should be exercised if EM is caused by an infectious agent. 
The optimal dose and duration of corticosteroids are unclear, but it is 
proposed to administer a daily i.v. bolus of corticosteroids followed by 
dosage tapering in severe forms, while oral steroid administration (see  
Table 12) can be considered in patients with mild LV dysfunction.39,271 
The identification of an EM-associated condition is crucial to administer 
specific treatments, such as cyclophosphamide or IL-5 inhibitors in 
EGPA-related EM,34 imatinib in the myeloproliferative variant of 
platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA)-associated 
HES, or albendazole in Toxocara canis infection. In hypersensitivity/allergic EM, first-line therapy is to withdraw the potential cause of 
eosinophilia. 
Since endocavitary thrombi were reported in 12% of EM cases, the 
use of anticoagulation during the acute phase could be considered for 
the prevention of endocavitary thrombi.271 
9.3. Giant-cell myocarditis 
Giant-cell myocarditis is a very rare, but often rapidly progressive disease with a poor prognosis, with an ∼85% rate of death or HT at 
3 years.56,82 The incidence of GCM was reported to range from 
0.007% to 0.051% in autopsy studies; however, this number might


<!-- PAGE 51 -->

### Page 51

underestimate the true disease burden.393,394 Giant-cell myocarditis 
generally affects young and middle-aged adults without a sex predominance. In a large multicentre registry of GCM cases, patients were aged 
from 16 to 69 years at the time of diagnosis.82 
Giant-cell myocarditis is recognized as a non-infectious myosin-induced 
autoimmune form, as experimental models suggest,395 and an association 
with autoimmune disorders has been reported in ∼20% of cases.82 
9.3.1. Presentation 
Early symptoms of GCM might not differ from other types of myocarditis and vary widely at the time of presentation. In an international 
registry of 63 GCM patients, HF was the presenting symptom in 75% 
of cases.82 The initial manifestations might be progressive haemodynamic deterioration or cardiogenic shock, intractable arrhythmias, 
and SCD. The condition often progresses rapidly to death, often within 
days to months. A systematic analysis including 51 patients with GCM 
showed that the cumulative incidence of SCD (fatal or aborted) was 
22% at 1 year and 26% at 5 years after presentation, and the composite 
incidence of SCD or VT was 41% at 1 year and 55% at 5 years.326 
Other early GCM manifestations include bradyarrhythmias and cardiac 
conduction abnormalities, including complete AVB. In a study from 
Finland, 25% of individuals <55 years of age with clinically idiopathic 
heart block had GCM or CS on heart biopsy.396 The presence of AM 
complicated by treatment-resistant HF or cardiogenic shock, VA, and 
AVB should increase the clinical suspicion of GCM. 
9.3.2. Diagnosis 
Endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold-standard diagnostic modality 
for GCM and can identify these patients at an early stage.397,398 Patients 
diagnosed with GCM through EMB had a shorter symptom-onset-to- 
diagnosis time and milder heart damage than those diagnosed during 
HT.398 
The presence of multinucleated giant cells in the absence of well- 
organized granulomatous lesions in the myocardial biopsy specimen 
is the hallmark of GCM. The giant cells are typically located in the interstitium or around blood vessels and are characterized by their large size, 
multinucleation, and cytoplasmic granules. 
Giant-cell myocarditis is characterized by myocardial destruction 
mediated by a large number of T cells, macrophages, multinucleated 
giant cells, and eosinophils in EMB.39 Generally, the histological diagnosis of GCM is guided by myocyte necrosis, diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells, and interstitial fibrosis.399,400 The severity of necrosis and 
fibrosis in EMB predicts the outcome.401 It is important to understand 
that one set of non-diagnostic EMB samples does not exclude GCM. 
The sensitivity of the first biopsy is 68% and increases to 93% when 
the biopsy is performed up to three times. Thus, repeated EMB should 
be considered when there is a high clinical suspicion of GCM.217 In a 
single-centre case series of GCM, LGE on CMR was present in 96% 
of cases, and its distribution correlated with the histology.401 Prompt 
EMB in the setting of suspected GCM can affect the choice of MCS, 
leading to an early listing for HT and consideration of cyclosporine- 
based immunosuppression.402 Administration of i.v. steroids prior to 
EMB may reduce the diagnostic yield of EMB. There should be an agreement in specialized centres to prioritize the evaluation of EMB, and to 
provide the results at least within 3 days, optimally within 8 h. 
9.3.3. Therapy 
As soon as GCM is suspected, immunosuppressive therapy should be initiated promptly to avoid disease progression and delay HT. It is crucial 
that the therapy should be initiated based on a strong clinical suspicion. 
Historically, the survival of patients with GCM without immunosuppression was about 3 months from symptom onset to death or HT. Many 
studies have shown that immunosuppression is useful for the treatment 
of GCM. Immunosuppressive therapy typically involves two or three 
drugs, including corticosteroids, and at least one, and usually two additional immunosuppressive agents (see Table 12). In GCM patients, immunosuppression with corticosteroid monotherapy is not associated 
with a prolongation of transplant-free survival.82 
Patients with GCM should receive the same guideline-based treatment for HF and arrhythmias as patients with heart disease from other 
causes.12,58 
Cyclosporine is the most commonly used immunosuppressant. In 
multiple retrospective and prospective studies, concomitant use of 
cyclosporine was associated with improved prognosis. Combining immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids and cyclosporine, 
azathioprine, or both improved transplant-free survival on average to 
12 months, while patients treated with corticosteroids alone survived 
on average 4 months.82 A cases series of GCM reported that 1-year 
transplant-free survival was 73% in patients who received corticosteroids and cyclosporine with or without muromonab-CD3, with a reported decrease of the degree of necrosis, cellular inflammation, and 
giant cells after 4 weeks of treatment.403 A systematic review of 27 
studies with 43 biopsy-proven GCM cases requiring MCS showed 
that the administration of immunosuppressive therapy prior to MCS 
implantation was associated with significantly better survival than treatment with MCS alone. Immunosuppression may reduce the severity of 
HF in these patients by preventing further autoimmune destruction of 
the myocardium.404 
Cessation or reduction of immunosuppression is associated with 
GCM recurrence as long as 8 years after diagnosis.344,403 
In a single-centre study, the risk of life-threatening VA in GCM patients exceeded 50% at 5 years after admission. Permanent ICD effectively terminated life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and no 
GCM patient with the device suffered from a SCD.326 
Transplantation could be considered for GCM patients who fail to 
respond to GDMT and immunosuppression. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 499 patients with CS and 69 with GCM 
who underwent HT found that 1- and 5-year survival rates in GCM patients were similar to those in transplant recipients with other HF 
aetiologies.405

9.4. Myocarditis in sarcoidosis 
Cardiac sarcoidosis is a form of inflammatory heart disease, coexisting 
with systemic sarcoidosis in 5%–10% of cases,406 or rarely, in isolation. 
The aetiology of sarcoidosis is not well understood, but may involve an 
autoimmune response after certain trigger(s) and genetic predisposition, 
which leads to the formation of non-caseating granulomas in multiple organs, typically in the lungs.407 On histopathology, the granuloma consists 
of CD68+ macrophages, CD68+ giant cells, CD3+ T lymphocytes, and 
CD20+ B lymphocytes. It is characterized by inflammation, oedema, 
lymphocytic infiltration, and replacement fibrosis.408 Cardiac sarcoidosis 
is often subclinical, with an estimated cardiac involvement in around 25% 
of cases on autopsy series in patients with sarcoidosis.409,410 
9.4.1. Presentation 
Manifestations of CS may range from cardiac inflammation, conduction 
system disease, frequent ectopy, tachyarrhythmia, and HF, to SCD.407 
Cardiac sarcoidosis may mimic different cardiac phenotypes, including 
ARVC,254,411–413 DCM, and hypertrophic CMP (HCM), but may also 
occur in patients with normal cardiac function.414 Symptoms are non- 
specific, and often related to arrhythmias, especially AVBs and VTs. The 
challenge is to identify patients at risk, since SCD due to malignant arrhythmia is common.415,416 
9.4.2. Diagnosis 
The diagnostic algorithm of CS is different in patients with or without 
known extracardiac sarcoidosis. Pathognomonic findings in non- 
invasive imaging are sufficient for the diagnosis of CS in cases with 
known systemic sarcoidosis.417 In contrast, the diagnostic pathway in 
primary CS is more challenging, but typical multimodality imaging patterns are usually sufficient. Cardiac sarcoidosis can manifest as abnormalities on ECG, echocardiography, CMR, PET, EMB, and cardiac and 
inflammatory blood biomarkers (see Section 5.4). Electrocardiogram 
or cardiac rhythm monitoring may demonstrate conduction system abnormalities (such as AVB or bundle-branch block) and arrhythmias, including VT.418 Echocardiography may reveal regional WMA in a 
non-coronary distribution, septal thinning, and ventricular aneurysms. 
Endomyocardial biopsy may be helpful in selected patients, but negative 
results do not rule out CS due to potential sampling errors.419 
Endomyocardial biopsy guided by imaging or EAM may improve the 
diagnostic yield (see Section 5.12). 
Multimodality advanced cardiac imaging, such as CMR and FDG-PET, 
plays an increasing role in the management of suspected CS. Overall, 
compared with FDG-PET, CMR has higher sensitivity of 89%–95% vs 
84%, respectively, but similar specificity of 78%–85% vs 82%, respectively, for the diagnosis of CS.408,420–428 
On CMR, CS has a wide range of potential findings, and is often considered the ‘great mimicker’ of various cardiac conditions, but the interventricular septum is often involved408 and the ‘hook sign’429 is 
recognized to be associated with a high probability of CS. For more details, see Supplementary data online, Figure S3. A heavy burden of LGE is 
associated with a poorer prognosis and predisposes to VA, HF, and death 
in CS, and may guide clinical decision-making.430–436 Aside from LGE, the 
identification of ongoing myocardial inflammation is possible.30,437–441 
Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography also allows detection of cardiac inflammation in CS.426 It requires careful patient preparation to suppress physiological 18F-FDG uptake. The classical finding is 
focal 18F-FDG uptake in the basal septum, with a concordant perfusion 
defect. Perfusion defects in the active stage of CS may be due to microvascular obstruction by inflammatory oedema, necrosis, or both, and are 
not necessarily located in the same region as the 18F-FDG uptake.427 
Hybrid PET-CMR may enable better detection of cardiac inflammation 
in a more comprehensive manner,440,442,443 but its availability is limited. 
Both CMR and PET may be used for imaging-guided EMB. 
The intensity and extent of FDG uptake on PET is of prognostic relevance.443–449 In a meta-analysis of 37 studies of patients with CS, LGE on 
CMR and FDG uptake on PET were both predictive of MACE (all-cause 
death, cardiac death and aborted SCD, VA, and HF hospitalization). 
Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography has proved to 
be useful in predicting and monitoring the anti-inflammatory therapy 
response in sarcoidosis;204,450 however, the optimal timing for repeating PET studies for the assessment of treatment response is not well 
established. 
In addition to clinical assessment, imaging modalities should be used 
for the short- and long-term management of patients with CS. 
9.4.3. Therapy 
The treatment of CS is currently not standardized, and is based on 
patient-tailored assessment, often with multidisciplinary input.451 
Treatment is targeted at controlling cardiac inflammation, myocardial 
scarring and dysfunction.13,431–436 First-line therapy includes corticosteroids (see Table 12). 
Since resolution of conduction abnormalities with anti-inflammatory 
treatment remains unpredictable, definitive cardiac pacing is usually 
needed. AVB and the need for cardiac pacing are associated with a higher risk of sustained VA, which reached 31% at 5 years in the Finnish 
registry.416,452,453 Thus, it appears reasonable to propose an ICD 
with pacing ability rather than a pacemaker in CS patients with pacing 
indications. The risk of VA during follow-up is high in observational 
studies, in patients with low LVEF,416,452,454,455 presence of LGE on 
CMR,434,456–459 and positive PVS.456,460–464 There is a lack of data on 
the relationship between scarring extent and arrhythmia risk. 
Positron emission tomography-computed tomography may also help 
to stratify patients.465 
Heart transplantation could be considered in a subgroup of patients 
with CS, similarly to GCM.405

9.5. Specific infectious myocarditis 
(Viruses, Lyme, Chagas) 
9.5.1. Viruses 
A large variety of infectious agents (Supplementary data online, Table S1) 
can cause myocardial inflammation, but viruses are considered the most 
common cause among infectious forms of myocarditis. Data on the true 
prevalence of viral myocarditis are difficult to determine, since EMB is 
performed only in a subgroup of high-risk patients and in complicated 
cases. Moreover, a positive viral serological test does not imply myocardial infection and is not routinely recommended. Exceptions are HIV and 
HCV and for specific infections such as Lyme disease.10 The epidemiology of viral myocarditis has changed during the past three decades; 
while enteroviruses and adenoviruses have been considered the most 
common causes of viral myocarditis,468 vasculotropic viruses such as 
B19V,63,66,468 and lymphotropic viruses such as HHV-6 are increasingly 
found in EMB samples.342,469 The prognostic relevance of persistent 
B19V infection with low viral copy numbers remains controversial because its presence in myocardial tissue may not have direct pathogenetic 
significance,470,471 in contrast to acute B19V infection.228 
9.5.1.1. Presentation 
Symptoms vary according to the underlying cause and severity of disease. However, it generally follows the presentation of acute and 
chronic stages, as presented in Section 4. 
9.5.1.2. Diagnosis 
The diagnostic approach should follow the description outlined in 
Section 4 (Figures 5 and 6). The presence of more than 500 copies/μg 
of DNA in EMB is considered as the threshold for virus-related myocardial inflammation, and usually guides therapeutic choices (e.g. starting 
immunosuppression). Viral PCR analysis in EMB samples is performed 
to better characterize the pathological substrate causing myocarditis. 
If immunosuppression is needed, viral presence has to be ruled out 
by EMB.10 Contemporary PCR analysis for viral presence in EMB specimens and blood samples is utilized to rule out possible tissue 
contamination.10,469 
9.5.1.3. Therapy 
Data are insufficient to support antiviral therapy for AM, as well as treatment with IVIG for presumed viral myocarditis.472 Anti-herpesvirus 
drugs in patients with CMV or HHV-6 infection can be considered, although their efficacy has not been directly studied in patients with 
myocarditis.10 Treatment with type I IFN in patients with enterovirus 
has been suggested to increase viral clearance, but large trials are missing.273,473–475 Antiviral therapies have to be prescribed and managed in 
collaboration with an infectious diseases expert with shared decision- 
making in the IMPS team.1,472 
9.5.1.3.1. Influenza virus. Supportive management is the backbone of 
severe influenza treatment. Myocardial involvement is rare, but should 
be considered in patients of any age with chest pain, tachycardia, and 
haemodynamic instability within 2–4 weeks from symptom onset. 
The effect of antiviral therapy on myocarditis is not clear, although oseltamivir is utilized in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Peramivir 
and zanamivir are used only for hospitalized patients. There are individual case reports of successful treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors.476–479 Peramivir has often been used in combination with either 
oseltamivir480,481 or zanamivir.482 
9.5.1.3.2. Human immunodeficiency virus. The pathogenesis of 
HIV-associated myocarditis involves direct viral infection, co-infection 
with other viruses or bacteria, cytokine activity, side effects of highly 
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), immune system dysregulation, 
and/or ischaemia. If HIV-associated myocarditis is diagnosed, therapy 
for HIV infection has to be started or continued. Highly active antiretroviral therapy has been reported to significantly decrease the incidence of cardiac involvement, especially pericarditis, arrhythmias, 
and DCM compared with patients treated with nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors in a retrospective study of 1042 patients.483 
9.5.2. Lyme carditis 
Lyme carditis may be an early manifestation of Lyme borreliosis, a tick- 
borne disease, caused by Borrelia spp., which is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in the northern hemisphere. 
9.5.2.1. Presentation 
In cases of early disseminated infection, AM with possible associated 
pericarditis may occur, but LC is typically characterized by varying degrees of AVB, with third-degree AVB in approximately 25% of cases.484 
Chronic LC often shows manifested persistent symptoms and signs, 
such as fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, headaches, sleep disturbance, 
neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal symptoms, electrical conduction 
delays, and DCM. 
9.5.2.2. Diagnosis 
The suspicious index in LC score has been proposed to evaluate the likelihood of high-degree AVB to be caused by LC. It allows categorization 
of patients into low-, intermediate- and high-risk categories.485 
Continuous ECG monitoring is required for patients presenting with 
syncope or with a PR interval of >300 ms, since this is a high-risk marker 
of progression to complete AVB.484 Serological tests are recommended 
for patients presenting with high-degree AVB and suspected LC. 
9.5.2.3. Therapy 
Atrioventricular block is often transient and typically resolves within 
1–2 weeks of antibiotic treatment, therefore permanent pacemaker 
placement is not warranted for AVB associated with LC before starting 
therapy. Intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone is the recommended 
first-line treatment for patients with LC and AV disturbances,486 followed by oral antibiotics (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime) for 
ICD implantation should be considered in patients 
with CS and LVEF >35% after resolution of the active 
phase with significant LGE, a history of arrhythmias, 
unexplained syncope, inducible sustained VA at PVS, 
or with persistent high-degree AVB to prevent 
SCD.416,434,452,453,456–464,467

at least 14 days and up to 21 days (total antibiotic course), depending 
on the severity of clinical presentation and response to treatment. 
The prognosis for early-treated disseminated LC is favourable, 
with complete recovery occurring in most patients treated with 
antibiotics.484,487 
Although LC may resolve spontaneously, antibiotic therapy shortens 
the disease duration and prevents further complications. 
9.5.3. Chagas disease 
Chagas disease (CD) is a systemic disorder caused by the protozoan 
parasite T. cruzi, which is transmitted through a haematophagous triatomine insect vector in endemic areas, such as Latin America, and 
can be transmitted transplacentally, by infected blood, or even orally 
through ingestion of contaminated food and drinks. Current migration 
has made CD a global disease, and congenital transmission has become 
relevant in non-endemic areas, including Europe. 
9.5.3.1. Presentation 
Acutely infected individuals remain asymptomatic or show mild and 
non-specific symptoms. Intense direct tissue parasitism may result in 
AM in less than 5% of cases. Chagas disease may evolve into CMP in 
20%–30% of cases. Common findings in patients with Chagas CMP include brady- or tachyarrhythmias, dilated ventricles with regional 
(mainly inferior, inferolateral, or apical) or global systolic dysfunction, 
and thromboembolism. 
9.5.3.2. Diagnosis 
Diagnosis of CD requires a high clinical suspicion. Polymerase chain 
reaction testing is the most sensitive test in acute infection while, 
for diagnosing chronic CD, the combination of two serological tests 
with antigens that detect different antibodies against T. cruzi is preferable. Multimodality imaging is able to support the diagnosis, as often 
apical aneurysms with and without thrombi can be detected by 
CMR.488 
9.5.3.3. Therapy 
Eradication of the parasite is a target in early phases, and anti-parasitic 
treatment should be provided as soon as possible, following detection 
of an acute infection. In the BENEFIT (Benznidazole Evaluation for 
Interrupting Trypanosomiasis) trial, 2854 patients with Chagas CMP 
were randomized to either benznidazole or placebo for 80 days. 
Benznidazole significantly reduced serum parasite detection, but there 
was no significant reduction in clinical cardiac deterioration at 
5 years.489 Therefore, anti-trypanosomal treatment should not be routinely used in adult patients with chronic CMP, but it can be considered 
in early and mild forms490,491 (see Table 12). Patients with Chagas CMP 
should be treated according to HF guidelines. Chagas disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality, with an annual rate of cardiovascular death of 6%.492 In this population, the benefit of ICD in primary 
and secondary prevention is controversial, since observational studies 
did not demonstrate a mortality benefit compared with amiodarone.493 
However, a systematic review and meta-analysis showed that, in patients with previous VT, appropriate ICD interventions and electric 
storms were frequent, occurring at a rate of 25% and 9% per year, respectively, with an overall mortality of 9% per year.494 A case-based decision is warranted. 
9.6. Drug- or vaccine-induced myocarditis 
9.6.1. Drug-induced myocarditis 
9.6.1.1. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment 
and are approved in multiple cancer types. These agents are monoclonal antibodies blocking specific molecules that inhibit the immune 
response—CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4), PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) and its ligand PD-L1 (programmed 
death ligand 1), and LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene 3)—strongly 
enhancing T-cell responses against cancer. By activating the immune 
system, ICIs may induce immune-related adverse events, which can affect any organ. Myocarditis is one of the most feared complications,495–497 although rare, as it affects approximately 1% of treated 
patients, within the first weeks following the initiation of therapy.495 
Since a growing number of patients are eligible for ICI treatment, 
the absolute number of cases is increasing. One of the largest case series, including 122 patients with ICI-associated myocarditis, recorded 
early onset after treatment initiation (median 30 days), and up to 
50% mortality.496 A systematic analysis of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) pharmacovigilance database confirmed a high 
mortality rate up to 33%.498 
The main risk factor for ICI-induced AM is combination therapy with 
two types of ICI, such as an anti-CTLA-4, e.g. ipilimumab, combined 
with an anti-PD-1, e.g. nivolumab.499 
This complication affects mostly men495 and older patients (median 
age 65 years) with more comorbidities.28,495 Furthermore, if ICIs are 
combined with other cancer therapies, their toxicity aggravates. 
9.6.1.1.1. Presentation. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis is especially arrhythmogenic, including a risk of conduction 
disorders, and HF with reduced EF occurs in about half of patients.500 
Myocarditis is frequently associated with peripheral myositis, which, 
when associated with respiratory failure, can negatively affect 
survival. 
9.6.1.1.2. Diagnosis. When suspected, rapid diagnostic triage is 
needed.495–497 Early diagnosis is extremely important, usually including laboratory tests and multimodality imaging (Section 5). The detection of a 
coexisting CAD in older patients should not refrain from further work-up 
for myocarditis (Table 4). In inconclusive cases an EMB can be necessary. 
For more details, see the 2022 ESC cardio-oncology guidelines.501 
9.6.1.1.3. Therapy. After diagnosis, immediate discontinuation of ICI 
and early (within the first 24 h) initiation of corticosteroids is warranted. Up to 50% of patients will be refractory to corticosteroids. In 
this situation, second-line immunosuppression treatments are necessary (see Table 12).502 In a prospective registry, the combination of ruxolitinib and high doses of abatacept, and screening for concurrent 
respiratory muscle failure, was associated with improved survival.502 
Long-term cardiovascular effects of ICIs become more and more relevant since a growing number of cancer patients are exposed to this 
therapy.503,504 Rechallenge with an ICI has to be considered following 
a multidisciplinary team discussion, based on factors such as the severity 
of the myocarditis, cancer prognosis, oncology treatment options, and 
patient preference.504,505 Details are given in the 2022 ESC guidelines 
for cardio-oncology.501

9.6.1.2. Other drugs associated with myocarditis 
Many drugs have been associated with myocarditis (see Supplementary 
data online, Table S10), especially clozapine.506 The reported incidence 
of clozapine-associated myocarditis ranges from 0.1% to 5%.507,508 
Drug-induced myocarditis may be associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome.509 Treatment is 
based on discontinuation of the drug and use of corticosteroids. 
9.6.2. Vaccine-induced myocarditis 
In 2002 the ‘Brighton collaboration’ was established with the aim to provide standards for the definition of adverse events after vaccination.510 
In a clinical context, different vaccines, apart from the SARS-CoV-2 
vaccine, have been associated with myocarditis. The main association 
is with smallpox vaccine,511 with data deriving mainly from the US military population. 
A systematic review reported cardiac events including IMPS after influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccine, and tetanus toxoid.512 
Few data reported myocarditis after receiving different vaccines (e.g. 
meningococcus, hepatitis A and B, diphtheria, poliovirus) (see  
Supplementary data online, Table S11).513–518 
A recent multicentre study reported good mid-term outcomes after 
COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis without death or need for 
HT.519 More detailed information can be found in Supplementary 
data online, Section 5.1.2. 
9.7. Pregnancy-associated myocarditis 
Peripartum CMP (PPCM) is sometimes associated with myocardial inflammation, more common particularly in patients presenting with arrhythmias.520 Pregnancy-associated myocarditis (PaM) is a rare 
condition, and its incidence and prognosis varies regionally.521–523 
Nutritional deficiencies, viral myocarditis, and autoimmune processes 
have been postulated as triggers. Recent data support the role of 
neurohormonal changes of late pregnancy and delivery, as well as the 
role of genetic predisposition.524 
9.7.1. Presentation 
There is no clear distinction between the phenotype of PaM and PPCM. 
Women develop symptoms of HF during late pregnancy or after delivery, with the majority being diagnosed after delivery, typically in the first 
month post-partum. A minority of patients may present with pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock, severe arrhythmias,525 cardio- 
pulmonary arrest, thromboembolic complications, and brain injury. 
9.7.2. Diagnosis 
There are no specific studies for PaM, therefore the guidance for PPCM 
should be followed. Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in any suspected case. In PPCM, LVEF is typically <45%.526 
Careful examination should be undertaken to clearly view the LV 
apex to detect intracardiac thrombi. Brain natriuretic peptide/ 
N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide are usually markedly elevated.527–529 
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is an advanced imaging 
modality if echocardiogram is inadequate, but gadolinium-based contrast 
agents should be avoided during pregnancy.530–532 Cardiovascular magnetic resonance is crucial to differentiate underlying causes.533 The detection of active inflammation can be performed without application of 
contrast media in CMR (Figure 4). 
Peripartum CMP has been associated with a higher rate of recovery 
than other forms of HF with reduced EF,534 and remission frequently 
occurs within the first 3 to 6 months.535 Delayed recovery can also occur after 2 years.536,537 
9.7.3. Therapy 
There are no dedicated studies for PaM, so advice is based on published 
literature for PPCM. 
Treatment of HF is essential, with modifications to ensure foetal 
safety during pregnancy.521,538–540 
Low-molecular-weight heparins do not cross the placenta, and are 
preferred during pregnancy if the thromboembolic risk is high.541 
Direct oral anticoagulants are less well studied in pregnancy, and should 
be avoided. Anticoagulation should be continued until recovery of LV 
function. 
Bromocriptine has been shown to improve LVEF at 6 months, but 
the results are contradictory.521,542–545 
Following delivery, most HF medications are compatible with breastfeeding. Many patients may also relapse. Treatment withdrawal and incomplete recovery of LV function are risk factors for recurrences.546,547 
Lifelong treatment has not been proven to be necessary. 
Pre-conception counselling should include discussion of the potential 
risks of recurrent myocardial dysfunction, even after recovery.547 
Multidisciplinary teams are warranted for patient management.548,549 
10. Inflammatory cardiomyopathy 
Inflammatory CMP is defined by chronic myocarditis in association with 
cardiac dysfunction and ventricular remodelling, with a clinical hypokinetic phenotype, either dilated or non-dilated, with or without arrhythmogenic substrate. It can also manifest as the evolution of a prior 
myocarditis, whether treated or untreated. Inflammatory CMP is involved in the pathogenesis of DCM. It includes immune-mediated/autoimmune forms and infectious subtypes.12,550 A genetic predisposition is

also important for the pathogenesis of inflammatory CMP.9 However, 
the rates, risk factors, and other characteristics of cases progressing 
from AM to chronic myocarditis or inflammatory CMP remain unknown. 
10.1. Presentation 
Patients with inflammatory CMP may present with new-onset/acute, 
subacute, or chronic HF. Although myocarditis resolves in >50% of 
cases, even spontaneously, approximately 25% of cases may present 
with persistent ventricular dysfunction, and more severe cases may 
progress to DCM.10 
10.2. Diagnosis 
A variety of clinical assessment, ECG, multimodality imaging, and, if 
needed, EMB can be used to reach a diagnosis. Persistent or chronic 
myocardial inflammation should be suspected in cases with non- 
ischaemic ventricular dysfunction associated with low QRS voltages, 
and persistent mild elevation of hs-TnT/TnI. The absence of significant 
remodelling may be observed in the early phase of the disease. This suspicion can be confirmed by multimodality imaging (echocardiography 
and CMR) and EMB, especially in the presence of myocardial oedema 
observed at CMR. Inflammatory CMP may be familial in rare cases. In 
these patients, genetic testing should be discussed. 
10.3. Therapy 
Guideline HF treatment is recommended in patients with inflammatory 
CMP.12,259 Medical therapy should be tailored to the underlying cause 
in case of systemic disorders, especially in autoimmune diseases. Only 
one RCT showed an improvement of cardiac function with immunosuppressive treatment in patients with virus-negative inflammatory 
CMP.551 Other non-randomized studies, often derived from single- 
centre and/or retrospective studies,34,131,551–555 suggest the efficacy 
of immunosuppression on top of optimized HF therapy, and support 
its safety. In patients with different immune-mediated myocarditis 
and HF, immunosuppressive therapy was safe.34,131,552–555 Therefore, 
the treatment should be based on histological/immunohistological 
and viral PCR examination of the biopsy specimens. 
In untreated cases, progression to DCM and transplantation or death 
are observed.10,39 
11. Specific types of pericarditis 
11.1. Tuberculous pericarditis 
In high-income countries, TB pericarditis accounts for up to 4% of pericardial disease, but it is increasing due to immigration. On the other hand, TB 
is the cause of clinically significant PEff in approximately 90% of 
HIV-infected and 50%–70% of non-HIV-infected individuals living in developing countries with a high prevalence of TB.556 It should be emphasized 
that most of the information on TB pericarditis comes from endemic 
areas in low-income countries and immunosuppressed patients.1 
Notably, the disease can occur at any age, and men are affected more frequently than women.48 Tuberculous pericarditis has an overall mortality 
rate of 17%–40% at 6 months after diagnosis.557 
11.1.1. Presentation 
Clinical presentations of TB pericardial involvement include AP (most 
commonly with PEff), ECP, and CP, with these manifestations representing consecutive stages of a unique process rather than independent 
conditions.558,559 Specifically, the evolution of TB pericarditis encompasses four stages (Figure 18). The first stage or dry stage of AP is without effusion, the second stage with PEff (this is the form most 
commonly encountered in clinical practice) in up to 80% of cases, the 
third stage with progressive absorption of effusion, and the fourth stage 
with pericardial constriction. In the effusive phase, pericardiocentesis 
usually yields bloody effusion, and effusive–constrictive physiology 
may emerge after pericardial drainage. At this stage, lymphocytic exudate is mainly observed.560 The duration of each stage varies and depends on individual factors (e.g. HIV status), and early treatment may 
prevent progression. 
11.1.2. Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of TB pericarditis is challenging and in 15%–20% of cases 
the diagnosis may be missed.561 A ‘definite’ diagnosis of TB is based on 
the presence of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid or on a histological sample of the pericardium, by culture or by PCR (Xpert MTB/RIF and 
RIF ultra) testing. A ‘probable’ diagnosis is made when there is proof of 
TB elsewhere in a patient with unexplained pericarditis, a lymphocytic 
pericardial exudate with elevated unstimulated IFN-γ (uIFN-γ), adenosine deaminase or lysozyme levels, and/or an appropriate response to 
antituberculosis therapy in endemic areas.558 In a meta-analysis, the 
sensitivity and specificity of adenosine deaminase, which is probably 
the most widely used biomarker, were 90% and 86%, respectively, 
for the diagnosis of TB pericarditis.562 Xpert MTB/RIF is highly specific 
(100%); however, it has a sensitivity of 64%, which increases to 78% 
when pericardial biopsy samples are employed.563,564 Pericardial fluid 
culture shows low sensitivity (53%–75%) and it is also time-consuming, 
needing more than 3 weeks to yield results. Interferon gamma offers superior accuracy for the diagnosis of microbiologically confirmed TB pericarditis compared with the adenosine deaminase (ADA) assay and the 
Xpert MTB/RIF test.563 In a meta-analysis, values of uIFN-γ in the pericardial fluid from studies using thresholds of 14–200 pg/mL showed very 
high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (99%) for the diagnosis of TB pericarditis, with a positive likelihood ratio of 187 and a negative likelihood 
ratio of 0.03.565 On the other hand, the tuberculin skin test and IFN-γ 
release assays are of limited value, especially in areas with a high burden 
of TB, since they cannot discriminate between previous exposure to 
Mycobacterium and active disease.566 A detailed approach is outlined 
in Supplementary data online, Table S12.

11.1.3. Therapy 
Medical treatment consists of a regimen including rifampicin, isoniazid, 
pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for at least 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for an additional 4 months, which is effective in 
treating extrapulmonary TB.1,567 Treatment for ≥9 months gives no 
better results and has the disadvantages of increased cost and poor 
compliance.567 
However, it should be emphasized that, excluding isoniazid, poor 
drug penetration into the pericardial space is a matter of concern, 
also considering the emerging evidence of intrapericardial bacillary 
load and mortality.568 
With the prompt use of antitubercular medications, steroids (oral 
or intrapericardial), and the widespread use of pericardial drainage 
with or without intrapericardial fibrinolysis, the currently reported 
rates of CP are between 5% and 25%.569 Moreover, contemporary 
treatment has accounted for a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality.567,569–572 
Pericardial drainage by any means (pericardiocentesis or pericardial 
window) is recommended as an essential part of the work-up in patients with suspected TB pericarditis, both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.1 
Constriction generally develops in up to 50% of patients within 6 months of presentation prior to the introduction of effective TB therapy.1 Appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential to 
prevent this progression.570 In addition, two interventions 
may reduce the incidence of constriction: (i) intrapericardial 
urokinase; and (ii) high-dose adjunctive prednisolone for 
6 weeks.569,573 
However, the coexistence of TB and HIV infection requires special attention. Prednisolone was associated with an increased risk of 
HIV-associated malignancies.569 On this basis, it may be reasonable 
to use adjunctive corticosteroids in patients with TB pericarditis 
without HIV infection and to avoid them in HIV-infected 
individuals.569

11.2. Pericardial involvement in neoplastic 
disease 
11.2.1. Presentation 
Neoplastic pericardial involvement is occasionally manifested by pericarditis or, more commonly, an isolated PEff (usually moderate to 
large, or CTP) with or without evident masses on imaging. It is usually 
related to metastatic lymphatic involvement (especially for lung cancer) or haematogenous spread (especially for breast cancer). In addition, lymphomas, leukaemias, and melanoma may affect the 
pericardium, as may cancer of contiguous organs (e.g. oesophageal 
cancer).574,575 Primary neoplastic disease of the pericardium is rare. 
Pericardial mesothelioma is the most common form, and it may present as ECP or CP in advanced cases. On this basis, the term ‘neoplastic pericarditis’ is often used incorrectly instead of ‘neoplastic 
pericardial effusion’. 
11.2.2. Diagnosis 
The definitive diagnosis is based on the confirmation of malignant infiltration within the pericardial fluid by cytology (pericardiocentesis) 
or pericardial biopsy. A probable diagnosis may be achieved by the 
detection of tumour markers in the pericardial fluid (e.g. CEA, 
CYFRA 21-1, NSE, CA-19-9, CA-72-4, SCC, GATA3, and VEGF), although none of these tumour markers has been proven to be accurate enough for distinguishing malignant from benign effusions.576,577 
Evidence of malignant disease elsewhere and concomitant pericarditis or PEff is also suggestive, although in almost two-thirds of patients 
with documented malignancy, pericardial involvement is caused by 
non-malignant diseases,15 e.g. radiation,578,579 chemotherapy,580 or 
infections. Cytological analyses of pericardial fluid are mandatory 
for the confirmation of malignant pericardial disease.581 Analyses 
of pericardial fluid and less commonly pericardial or epicardial biopsies are essential for the confirmation of malignant pericardial 
disease. 
11.2.3. Therapy 
The management of these patients requires a multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, cardiologists, and radiotherapists, as 
well as other specific subspecialty experts according to the type of 
cancer. 
General principles of treatment include systemic antineoplastic 
treatment as baseline therapy. Local antineoplastic treatment is based 
on tailored intrapericardial therapy according to the type of tumour 
(e.g. cisplatin is efficacious in lung cancer, thiotepa in breast cancer),582 
and intrapericardial instillation of cytostatic/sclerosing agents to prevent recurrences. Malignant PEffs show a high recurrence rate 
(>50%). Extended pericardial drainage can be necessary in patients 
with suspected or definite neoplastic PEff to prevent effusion recurrence and provide a route for intrapericardial therapy. Additional interventions for recurrent effusions may include pericardiotomy, 
pericardial window, and percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy. All 
techniques are palliative and aimed at improving the quality of life of patients with a poor short-term outcome. 
Radiation therapy is very effective in controlling malignant PEff in patients with radiosensitive tumours, such as lymphomas and leukaemias. 
In clinical practice, management is often palliative at late stages with 
advanced disease, and it is aimed only at the relief of symptoms rather 
than treatment of the underlying disease, considering the prognosis, 
and the overall quality of life of the patient. 
11.3. Post-cardiac injury syndrome 
The term PCIS is an umbrella term indicating a group of inflammatory pericardial syndromes, including late post-acute myocardial 
infarction (post-AMI) pericarditis (or Dressler syndrome), post- 
pericardiotomy syndrome (PPS), and post-traumatic pericarditis 
with or without bleeding. Currently several post-traumatic cases 
are iatrogenic and related to cardiovascular interventions.585,586 
Nowadays, Dressler syndrome appears in <1% of cases, mainly in 
larger infarctions and/or late reperfusion, typically 1–2 weeks after 
AMI.587 Notably, patients with a post-AMI PEff of >10 mm at end- 
diastole should be investigated for a possible subacute heart 
rupture.588,589 
In contrast, cases developing after cardiac device implantation or arrhythmia ablation (e.g. pericarditis appears in ∼10% of cases after AF 
ablation) are becoming increasingly common due to the growing 
number of invasive procedures.586,587,590,591 
Such syndromes are presumed to have an autoimmune pathogenesis 
triggered by pericardial bleeding and/or pleura incision.47,592 An 
immune-mediated pathogenesis is supported by a latent period,

generally a few weeks, until the appearance of the first manifestations, 
the positive response to anti-inflammatory drugs, and the possibility of 
recurrences. 
11.3.1. Diagnosis 
According to proposed diagnostic criteria, the diagnosis of PCIS may be 
reached in the presence of at least two of the following five criteria: (i) 
fever without alternative causes; (ii) pericardial or pleuritic chest pain; 
(iii) pericardial or pleural rubs; (iv) evidence of PEff; and/or (v) pleural 
effusion with elevated C-reactive protein.593–595 
The rationale for proposing specific criteria is that these syndromes 
may have concomitant pleuro-pericardial involvement and possible pulmonary infiltrates, and are not simply pericarditis.595 Moreover, it is 
sometimes difficult to differentiate PCIS from the simple mechanical 
consequences of surgery (such as early pericardial or pleural effusion). 
The demonstration of inflammatory activity (e.g. C-reactive protein elevation) is essential to establish the diagnosis. Multimodality imaging can 
be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated cases (e.g. loculated effusions, evidence of inflammation). 
11.3.2. Therapy 
The same therapeutic scheme adopted for AP, essentially based on empirical anti-inflammatory therapy, is effective for all forms of PCIS, and 
may improve remission rates and reduce the risk of recurrences. In 
early post-AMI pericarditis, a 5–7-day course of aspirin seems the 
most reasonable option, in association with colchicine.587 
Different treatment strategies (namely aspirin, methylprednisolone, 
dexamethasone, and colchicine) have been adopted for the primary 
prevention of PPS, and the effects of such treatments have been addressed in a meta-analysis that showed that only colchicine was associated with a decreased risk of PPS (OR 0.38), sometimes, however, 
with an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.593,594,596–600 
Preventive administration of colchicine can be given after cardiac surgery using weight-adjusted doses (i.e. 0.5 mg once for patients 
≤70 kg and 0.5 mg twice daily for patients >70 kg) and without a loading dose for the prevention of PPS and continued for 1 month.596 
In this guideline document, the LOE for colchicine recommendation 
for the prevention of PPS is based on analysis of the available evidence 
from more than one RCT, systematic reviews and the consensus opinion of the TF members. 
Neither NSAIDs nor colchicine have to be administered for post- 
operative effusions in the absence of systemic inflammation.601,602 
Early post-operative PEffs are relatively common after cardiac surgery, 
and usually disappear spontaneously in 7–10 days.1 Asymptomatic small 
PEffs do not require treatment; however, moderate to large effusions 
(observed in one-third of cases) can progress to CTP at a rate of 
10% within 1 month after surgery and need pericardial decompression.603 Treatment of these asymptomatic effusions by NSAIDs has 
been shown to be ineffective [e.g. diclofenac in the Post-Operative 
Pericardial Effusion (POPE) trial], and may be associated with an increased risk of side effects.601 
The prognosis of PPS is generally good.600 In the largest published 
series on PPS patients after cardiac surgery, complication rates were 
low: <4% for recurrences; <2% for CTP; and no cases of constriction, 
although hospital stay may be prolonged in these patients.592 
Moreover, the development of CP has been reported in ∼3% of 
cases.347 Both early post-AMI pericarditis and Dressler syndrome are 
markers of larger infarct size, but without independent prognostic 
significance.587 
11.4. Pericarditis and autoinflammatory 
diseases 
Compared with the previous guidelines, it has become evident that some 
inflammatory forms of RP share similarities with genetic autoinflammatory diseases characterized by periodic fevers, e.g. FMF and TRAPS.50,51 
These are genetic disorders characterized by mutations of genes involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response, without involvement of specific T cells or autoantibodies.605 These disorders are 
usually detected in the paediatric population, although some patients experience disease onset during adulthood. The most common monogenic 
autoinflammatory syndromes include FMF, in which serositis episodes last 
only 1–3 days, and TRAPS, in which fever and symptoms last for weeks.605 
Mutations associated with these disorders have been reported in up to 
10% of patients with multiple recurrences, especially with a positive family 
history, and a poor response to colchicine.152 Recently, rare deleterious 
MEFV variants were observed more frequently in idiopathic RP than 
in ancestry-matched controls (allele frequency 9/200 vs 2932/129 200, 
P = 0.040).50 These conditions are characterized by the exaggerated production of IL-1 by the inflammasome. Familial occurrence of pericarditis 
has been reported among the relatives of idiopathic RP patients, ranging 
from 4%50 to 10%.113 These data suggest a genetic predisposition in at 
least a subset of patients; counselling may be warranted in these cases. 
11.5. Purulent pericarditis 
Purulent pericarditis, namely the most serious manifestation of bacterial pericarditis, is characterized by the macro- or microscopic presence 
of purulent PEff. It is an exceedingly rare form of pericarditis in the 
Western world, accounting for <1% of AP cases.606 It has a high mortality in untreated cases while, in optimally treated patients, the reported survival rate is approximately 15%–40%.606 
In developed countries, the most common organisms isolated in 
purulent pericarditis include staphylococci and streptococci, while

the predominant associated lesions are empyema (50%) or pneumonia 
(33%). In immunosuppressed patients or following thoracic surgery, the 
most frequently encountered bacterial/fungal agents are Staphylococcus 
aureus (30%) and fungi (20%), while anaerobic bacteria, originating from 
the oropharynx, have also been reported.607,608 
It should be stressed that in the modern era of iatrogenic and 
HIV-associated immunosuppression, more unusual organisms may account for pericardial infection.1,607 
11.5.1. Presentation 
Purulent pericarditis has generally manifested as a serious febrile disease, 
and the underlying sepsis may predominate, including septic shock.606–608 
Constrictive pericarditis complicates 20%–30% of cases.347 
11.5.2. Diagnosis 
Suspicion of purulent pericarditis is an indication for pericardial drainage 
independently from the haemodynamic status. Surgical pericardial drainage is recommended to allow complete removal of the fluid and prevent 
its organization and progression to constriction. Low pericardial-to-serum 
glucose ratio (mean 0.3) and elevated pericardial fluid white cell count 
with a high proportion of neutrophils (mean cell count 2.8/mL, 92% neutrophils) differentiate purulent from tuberculous (glucose ratio 0.7, mean 
cell count 1.7/mL, 50% neutrophils) and neoplastic pericarditis (glucose 
ratio 0.8, mean cell count 3.3/mL, 55% neutrophils). 
Fluid must be sent for bacterial, fungal, and tuberculous studies along 
with blood and tissue samples, as guided by the clinical presentation.1 
11.5.3. Therapy 
Intravenous antimicrobial therapy should be started empirically until 
microbiological results are available. Afterwards, pathogen-directed antibiotic therapy is warranted based on antibiotic susceptibility.1 The duration of antibiotic therapy should be individualized until fever and clinical 
signs resolve, with the minimum period of administration being 3 weeks. 
Purulent effusions are often heavily loculated and likely to rapidly reaccumulate. Subxiphoid pericardiotomy and rinsing of the pericardial cavity should be considered.15 This allows more complete drainage of the 
effusion, since loculations can be manually lysed. Intrapericardial fibrinolysis is a possible treatment for cases of loculated effusions to achieve adequate drainage.609 Fibrinolysis has been shown to prevent complications 
in approximately 86% of cases without fatal complications.573,609,610 In 
the unfortunate case that percutaneous measures fail to control infection, and worsening HF occurs along with constrictive physiology features, referral to surgical pericardiectomy is advised.610 
11.6. Incessant and recurrent pericarditis 
The TF proposes to adopt the term ‘incessant’ for cases of persistent 
symptoms without clear remission, and thus also to include cases of 
symptom persistence/recurrence during drug tapering. Recognition of 
these cases is of paramount importance, since they can directly progress 
to CP within a few months.104 Recurrent pericarditis is defined as a relapse after a documented first episode of AP, a symptom-free interval, 
complete discontinuation of anti-inflammatory therapy, and evidence 
of subsequent recurrence of pericarditis. Recurrence usually occurs within 18 months from the index episode, and is the most common and 
problematic complication of AP, ranging from 15% to 30% of cases after 
a first episode of pericarditis. It may increase to 50% after a first recurrence in patients with inadequate treatment of the first episode (e.g. 
too fast tapering, not treated with colchicine, treated with corticosteroids).25,611 In developed countries, the aetiology of recurrences is poorly 
known, and most cases are labelled as idiopathic. Historically, most cases 
were probably related to an autoinflammatory/autoimmune pathogenesis. This is based on the inflammatory/non-inflammatory phenotype, 
the latency from the acute attack (several weeks after the index episode), 
the presence of autoantibodies, and the response to anti-inflammatory/ 
immunosuppressive treatments.52,283,284,287 
11.7. Inflammatory and non-inflammatory 
pericardial effusion 
The normal pericardial sac contains 10–50 mL of pericardial fluid, a 
plasma ultrafiltrate that acts as a lubricant between the pericardial 
layers. Any pathological process that causes pericardial inflammation increases the amount of fluid, causing PEff (exudate). Alternative mechanisms causing PEff include decreased reabsorption following increased 
systemic venous pressure, as observed in congestive HF or pulmonary 
hypertension (transudate) or alternatively, decreased lymphatic drainage.612 The regimen of pressures in the epicardium and pericardial cavity is shown in Supplementary data online, Figure S4. 
11.7.1. Classification and aetiology 
The reported incidence and prevalence of PEff in developed countries is 
estimated at 3% and 6%–9%, respectively, based on echocardiographic 
laboratory records.613 Pericardial effusion was detected in 14% of subjects in a prospective registry of consecutive patients who underwent 
chest CT.198 
The classification of PEff is shown in Table 10. Echocardiography provides semiquantitative assessment of the effusion size, which is useful for 
estimating the risk of having a non-idiopathic aetiology and complications 
(see Supplementary data online, Figure S5).105 In the past three decades, 
six major surveys have been published on the characteristics of moderate 
to large PEff (see Supplementary data online, Table S13).556,614–618 
According to these series, many cases remain idiopathic in developed 
countries (up to 50%), while additional aetiologies include cancer 
(10%–32%), infections (15%–30%), iatrogenic causes (15%–20%), and 
connective tissue diseases (5%–15%), whereas TB is the dominant cause 
in developing countries (>60%), where TB is endemic.558 
11.7.2. Presentation 
A significant proportion of patients with PEff are asymptomatic, and PEff is 
an incidental finding during routine examination. The clinical presentation 
of PEff varies according to the speed of accumulation of fluid (see  
Supplementary data online, Figure S4). Classic symptoms include exertional 
dyspnoea progressing to orthopnoea, chest pain, and feeling of fullness.

Additional symptoms due to the compression of adjacent structures include nausea (diaphragm), dysphagia (oesophagus), hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve), and hiccups (phrenic nerve).118,619 
11.7.3. Diagnosis 
Physical examination may be normal in patients without haemodynamic 
compromise. Echocardiography is the primary diagnostic tool for 
diagnosis, sizing, assessment of haemodynamic effects, and follow-up 
(see Supplementary data online, Figure S5).115,124 Advanced imaging 
(CT and CMR) provides valuable information concerning local inflammation, masses, associated chest abnormalities (e.g. pectus excavatum), 
loculated effusions, and systemic diseases.196,198,620 Pericardial effusion 
is often associated with known or unknown medical conditions (e.g. 
hypothyroidism) in up to 60% of cases, especially if moderate/large.615

### Page 62

Patients presenting with PEff without inflammatory marker elevation 
have an increased risk of a neoplastic aetiology (likelihood ratio 2.9).615 
In chronic effusions with no definite aetiology, and without inflammatory markers, empirical anti-inflammatory treatment is futile.1,621 In 
worsening large effusions without evidence of systemic inflammation, 
the exclusion of cancer with advanced imaging (mainly CT) is warranted.196 C-reactive protein should be measured before pericardiocentesis, since it can increase after the procedure.622 Notably, the 
classical Light criteria used for the classification of pleural effusions 
should not be applied to PEff due to the high rate of misclassification 
of fluids as exudates, since pericardial fluid is rich in mesothelial cells, 
proteins, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).623,624 
11.7.4. Therapy 
The treatment of PEff is shown in Figure 19. Therapy of PEff should be 
targeted at the aetiology, as much as possible. In the absence of pericardial inflammation (namely in the absence of C-reactive protein elevation 
and evidence of pericardial inflammation by an imaging technique) anti- 
inflammatory treatment is not recommended. According to recent 
data, the usefulness of pericardial drainage in asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic, large, chronic, idiopathic effusions without evidence of 
pericarditis has been revised.49,621 Conservative treatment improves 
outcomes, the risk of CTP being only 2.2%/year without reported 
deaths.625 In addition, survival after recurrence or complications is 
significantly better in patients treated conservatively without interventions. Nevertheless, if during follow-up the PEff becomes symptomatic 
and haemodynamic impairment is observed by echocardiography, 
drainage is warranted. 
11.7.5. Prognosis and follow-up 
The prognosis of PEff is essentially related to its aetiology.626 Moderate 
to large effusions are more common for specific aetiologies.105,615 In 
general, PEff should be considered as a marker of the severity of the 
underlying disease.584 Small, idiopathic, asymptomatic PEff have an 
overall good prognosis with a very low risk of complications, although 
not all studies concur.613 Those individuals should be reassured about 
the benign nature of the condition, and should not restrict their physical 
activity if C-reactive protein is normal.11 The follow-up of PEff is mainly 
based on the evaluation of symptoms, using focused echocardiography 
to assess size changes, and haemodynamic issues, as well as C-reactive 
protein. Asymptomatic patients with mild idiopathic effusions do not 
generally require specific monitoring. In asymptomatic patients with 
at least moderate effusions, a reasonable follow-up is every 6 months, 
ideally in specialized centres. The latter patients should be instructed to 
seek medical advice in case of symptom appearance, such as dyspnoea 
or fatigue, and/or chest pain suggesting pericarditis. 
11.8. Cardiac tamponade 
Cardiac tamponade is a pericardial syndrome occurring when PEff impairs diastolic filling of the heart until cardiac output is reduced. The 
size of the effusion as well as its distribution may vary. Since the pericardium is relatively stiff, if pericardial fluid collects quickly, such as in haemopericardium, the limit of pericardial stretching is reached quickly with 
volumes of 200–300 mL. In contrast, slowly accumulating PEff may reach 
1 to 2 L before the development of CTP (Supplementary data online,  
Figure S4). This pathophysiology explains that CTP is a last-drop phenomenon. Thus, a small increase of pericardial volume may precipitate the 
syndrome, and the aspiration of small amounts of pericardial fluid with 
pericardiocentesis may greatly improve the clinical condition.118 
Pericardial effusions are usually circumferential, but after trauma or 
cardiac surgery, they may be loculated and even be responsible for localized compression and the development of CTP. 
11.8.1. Presentation 
Beck identified a triad of signs, consisting of hypotension, increased JVP, 
and quiet heart sounds as presenting symptoms.118,619 
This triad was classically identified in ‘surgical tamponade’ with acute 
CTP due to intrapericardial haemorrhage because of trauma, or myocardial/aortic rupture. Beck’s triad may be lacking in patients with ‘medical tamponade’ with slowly accumulating pericardial fluid. Acute CTP is 
usually associated with tachycardia and low blood pressure 
(<90 mmHg) that is only slightly reduced in subacute, chronic tamponade.118,619 On physical examination, classical signs include neck vein distention with elevated JVP, pulsus paradoxus, and diminished heart 
sounds. Pulsus paradoxus is defined as an inspiratory reduction of the 
systolic blood pressure by at least 10 mmHg.118,619 Pulsus paradoxus 
is due to exaggerated ventricular interdependence occurring in CTP, 
when the overall volume of ventricles becomes unable to expand, 
and any change in the volume on one side of the heart causes opposite 
changes on the other side. On ECG, the patient usually shows tachycardia, low QRS voltages, and electrical alternans due to the damping effect 
of pericardial fluid and swinging heart.118,619 
11.8.2. Aetiology and diagnosis 
Cardiac tamponade shares the same causes of PEff. In clinical practice, 
the most common aetiologies include cancer, TB, purulent infections, 
trauma, iatrogenic complications of cardiovascular interventions (e.g. 
ablation of arrhythmias, device implantation, PCIS), acute aortic disease, 
systemic inflammatory diseases, and renal failure.118 In the setting of AP 
with a viral or idiopathic aetiology, CTP is rare (1%–2% of cases) and is 
more common with pericarditis associated with a non-idiopathic aetiology (20%).347 The diagnosis of CTP is a clinical diagnosis based on 
the combination of a suggestive history, symptoms, signs, and imaging 
confirmation by echocardiography (Table 17).118

The diagnosis of CTP identifies high-risk patients with an increased 
risk of complications during follow-up and a high probability of a non- 
viral aetiology. The patients should be admitted for therapy and 
monitoring.1,105 
The definitive therapy is pericardiocentesis, which should be performed urgently according to the clinical presentation. 
11.8.3. Therapy 
The treatment for CTP is drainage of the pericardial fluid, preferably by 
needle pericardiocentesis with the use of echocardiographic or fluoroscopic guidance, and should be performed without delay in unstable patients. Alternatively, drainage is performed by a surgical approach, 
especially in situations such as purulent pericarditis, or urgent situations 
with bleeding into the pericardium. 
Pericardiocentesis should be performed by experienced operators 
trained/certified in acute cardiovascular care and carries a variable 
risk of complications from 4% to 10%, depending on type of monitoring, operator’s skill, and setting (emergent vs urgent vs elective). The 
most common complications include arrhythmias, coronary artery or 
cardiac chamber puncture, haemothorax, pneumothorax, pneumopericardium, and hepatic injury.1 Mechanical ventilation with positive airway pressure should be avoided in CTP. In addition, diuretic therapy 
should be avoided, and temporary fluid administration can be helpful 
to stabilize the patient while waiting for urgent pericardiocentesis. 
11.8.4. Outcomes and prognosis 
The prognosis of CTP is essentially related to its aetiology. Cardiac tamponade in patients with cancer and metastatic involvement of the pericardium has a bad short-term prognosis, since this is a sign of advanced 
disease. In contrast, patients with CTP and a final diagnosis of idiopathic 
pericarditis generally have a good long-term prognosis.1,105 
11.9. Pericardial constriction and 
constrictive pericarditis (calcified and 
non-calcified) 
11.9.1. Introduction 
Pericardial constriction is a chronic condition usually characterized by a 
thickened, fibrotic, and often calcified pericardium that leads to impaired diastolic filling of the heart. Constrictive pericarditis is 
constriction associated with pericarditis.114,119,347 There is a high risk 
of progression in bacterial pericarditis (20%–30%), especially purulent 
pericarditis, intermediate risk in immune-mediated pericarditis and 
neoplastic pericardial diseases (2%–5%), and a low risk in viral and idiopathic pericarditis (<1%).347 Cases of CP after pericardiectomy have 
been reported, especially after partial pericardiectomy.627–630 In developed countries, the most common reported causes are: viral or idiopathic (42%–49%); post-cardiac surgery (11%–37%); post-radiation 
therapy, mostly for breast cancer or Hodgkin’s disease (9%–31%); connective tissue disorders (3%–7%); post-infectious causes (purulent pericarditis or TB in 3%–6%); and miscellaneous causes (<10%). TB is a 
major cause of CP in developing countries.630,631 
11.9.2. Presentation 
The classical clinical presentation comprises signs and symptoms of 
right HF with preserved biventricular function without previous or concomitant myocardial disease. Subacute/chronic inflammatory pericarditis can evolve into CP, and the duration of progression from initial 
pericardial inflammation and the onset of constriction is variable.347 
Systolic dysfunction due to myocardial fibrosis or atrophy can aggravate 
the haemodynamic impairment in more advanced cases. 
In up to 20% of cases, constriction might be present with normal 
pericardial thickness, while advanced and classic cases demonstrate 
prominent pericardial thickening and calcifications.119 
11.9.3. Diagnosis 
The diagnosis is made by multimodality imaging methods, such as echocardiography, CT, and CMR (Figure 13). Cardiac catheterization should 
be considered only if non-invasive multimodality imaging methods are 
inconclusive.115,124,632,633 The Mayo Clinic has proposed specific diagnostic criteria, based on echocardiography to diagnose CP, that have 
been confirmed by other centres. They include the presence of septal 
bounce or ventricular septal shift with either medial e’ of >8 cm/s or 
hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio of >0.78 (sensitivity 
87%, specificity 91%; specificity may increase to 97% if all criteria are 
present with a corresponding decrease of sensitivity to 64%). In addition, respirophasic variation E-wave mitral inflow of >25%/tricuspid inflow of >40% can be recorded in these patients632,634 (see  
Supplementary data online, Figures S1, S5, and Table S14). The main reported constrictive syndromes are shown in Table 18.

11.9.4. Therapy 
Medical therapy is considered for specific aetiologies, such as TB, 
to prevent progression to constriction.558 Antituberculosis drugs 
may significantly reduce the risk of constriction from >80% 
to <10%.569 Anti-inflammatory therapy may help to resolve transient constriction in 10%–20% of cases of AP.121,122 In such cases, 
to identify patients with potentially reversible forms of constriction, pericarditis should be excluded by testing markers of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein) or looking for imaging evidence of 
pericardial inflammation (e.g. pericardial oedema and/or LGE on 
CMR). 
In advanced cases, medical therapy is supportive of controlling symptoms of congestion, but surgery should never be delayed to improve 
outcomes. 
Pericardiectomy is the standard therapy for symptomatic chronic 
constriction without inflammation or not responding to anti- 
inflammatory therapy (see Section 6.4.2). For milder disease or more 
advanced disease, or for those with radiation-induced disease, reduced 
EF, or advanced renal disease, caution is necessary. Radical pericardiectomy rather than anterior phrenic-to-phrenic pericardiectomy is warranted for the best outcomes.311,635–637 
In general, pericardiectomy has been seen as a high-risk surgery with 
operative mortality of 6%–10%. However, recent studies show better 
results for early surgery in high-volume centres. The risk is related to 
the aetiologies and other comorbidities. Idiopathic causes have the lowest risk of <1.5%.638–640 
11.10. Effusive–constrictive pericarditis 
11.10.1. Introduction 
In ECP, pericardial fluid is present, and the scarred pericardium puts 
pericardial fluid under increased pressure, constricts the cardiac volumes, and leads to signs of CTP.116,117 Classically it is defined haemodynamically as failure of the RAP to fall by 50% or to a level below 
10 mmHg after pericardiocentesis.117 Modern multimodality imaging 
allows a non-invasive diagnosis without cardiac catheterization. 
11.10.2. Aetiology 
Limited data have been published on ECP, and it appears to be a common condition in developing countries.117 Idiopathic cases are most 
commonly found in developed countries, while TB appears to be the 
most common cause in developing countries. The other reported 
causes are neoplasia, radiation, chemotherapy, infections (mainly TB 
and purulent type), and post-surgical pericardial disease.641 
11.10.3. Presentation 
Clinical features of either CP or CTP, or sometimes both, are typically 
present in patients with ECP. In patients who appear to have uncomplicated CTP, the diagnosis usually becomes evident during pericardiocentesis.117 Tricuspid regurgitation or right HF may cause persistently 
elevated RAP after efficient pericardiocentesis. 
11.10.4. Diagnosis 
To diagnose ECP, non-invasive imaging may be valuable.641 Thickening of 
the epicardial–pericardial layer is responsible for the constrictive component. After pericardiocentesis for CTP, careful detection of constriction 
on Doppler findings can be reported.124 Without haemodynamic monitoring, ECP can also be suspected on echocardiography and CMR (see  
Supplementary data online, Table S14). Cardiovascular magnetic resonance may provide helpful information, especially in differentiating constriction from RCM (Table S14). An accurate evaluation of ventricular 
interdependence and septal bounce can be made by assessing ventricular 
coupling with echocardiography and/or real-time cine CMR.115 
Echo-Doppler findings indicating effusive constriction may be detected 
prior to pericardiocentesis.116,124 Currently, the diagnosis can be made 
using multimodality imaging without cardiac catheterization. 
11.10.5. Treatment 
Effusive constriction can often resolve spontaneously or be treated with 
anti-inflammatory therapies in the case of evidence of transient constriction.641 In resistant cases, visceral pericardiectomy must be performed, 
since the epicardial layer is responsible for constricting the heart. The visceral 
component of pericardiectomy requires sharp dissection of many small fragments until ventricular motion is improved. Only pericardial centres with experience and competency should perform pericardiectomy for CP. 
12. Age- and sex-related aspects in 
inflammatory myopericardial 
syndrome 
12.1. Sex distribution 
Acute myocarditis is more prevalent in males (75%–84%).17,28,73,78,642 
On the contrary, the male-to-female ratio is similar in fulminant cases 
(46% females).56,75,643 Sex differences in pericarditis are less evident,

with some studies showing a mild prevalence in males of 59% in AP.37 
Males aged 16–65 years are at higher risk of pericarditis (relative risk 
2.02) than females. On the other hand, the probability of pericarditis 
recurrence is higher in females (HR 1.67), probably due to the higher 
frequency of specific causes (e.g. autoimmune diseases).105 
12.2. Paediatric patients 
12.2.1. Myocarditis 
The annual incidence of myocarditis during childhood is between 1 and 
2 cases per 100 000 children.21,644,645 In children <6 years of age, the 
sex distribution was balanced, 50% each,20 but boys had a significantly 
higher incidence at ages 6 to 15 years.21 
The proposed diagnostic approach in adults applies also for children, 
including CMR (e.g. in the MYKKE registry).646 
There are conflicting data regarding the complication rates of EMB in 
children, with some studies reporting similar incidence of complications 
as in adults, both around 5%, mainly from RV sampling.40,63 Particular 
care should be taken in children aged <1 year and in the case of LV biopsies with reported complication rates up to 30%.213 
In particular, very young children are predisposed to severe myocarditis. Critically ill children admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 
mostly survived, if receiving high-resource therapies, including 
MCS.647 In a prospective multicentre registry it was shown that in acute 
HF and FM, MCS including VAD improved survival.648 Similar results 
have also been reported from Japan.649 
In infants, enteroviruses, such as Coxsackievirus, were found more 
commonly than in adults.649 A presumed viral aetiology was identified 
in 11%–50%,40,63 with a death or HT rate of 2%, similar to adults.21 In 
biopsy-proven myocarditis, the HT rate rises to 7%, and the mortality 
rate increases to 4%–6%.40 
Therapy for myocarditis in children is not well defined. In a 
meta-analysis evaluating corticosteroids, no mortality reduction was 
observed, but a significant improvement in LVEF was reached with 
the use of steroids in other studies.650–652 In a meta-analysis evaluating 
IVIG,628 treatment was not associated with better survival. This was 
also supported by a prospective trial653 and a multicentre cohort 
study.654 On the contrary, another meta-analysis655 in FM concluded 
that IVIG therapy (usually 1–2 g/kg over 24–48 h) significantly reduced 
in-hospital mortality and improved LVEF. 
Genetic evaluation might help in the future in differentiating subsets 
of children and tailoring therapies.93 
12.2.2. Pericarditis 
In children aged 12 years or less, the incidence of AP was 2.8/100 000 in a 
population study from 2009 to 2021.644 The diagnostic criteria (see  
Table 4), aetiologies, and risk of recurrences (see Tables S2 and S3) are 
similar to those reported in adults (see Supplementary data online,  
Table S1). Most paediatric cases of pericarditis are related to PPS, particularly after atrial septal defect closure. Compared with adults, children more 
commonly have an inflammatory phenotype.656 Non-steroidal anti- 
inflammatory drugs remain the mainstay of therapy at high dosages (see  
Supplementary data online, Table S15). Most paediatricians avoid aspirin. 
Colchicine halved recurrences in children, similarly as for adults.656,657 
The use of corticosteroids should be restricted even more than in adults, 
given that their side effects (including striae rubrae and growth impairment) are particularly deleterious in growing children. Anti-interleukin-1 
agents have been used for the first time in children with autoinflammatory 
diseases and then adopted for RP in them, representing a new therapeutic 
option, especially if they are corticosteroid-dependent. However, it is 
often difficult to withdraw these drugs when clinical remission is achieved; 
for instance, in one study only 15% of children were able to stop anti-IL-1 
agents after a mean follow-up of 2.6 years.658 Few paediatric patients were 
enrolled in RCTs testing anakinra and rilonacept.283,284 
12.3. Pregnancy, lactation, and 
reproductive issues 
There is very limited published evidence on this topic. There are only 
case reports for myocarditis,659–663 and one case series describing 
pregnant women with RP.664 Pregnancy-associated myocarditis is described in Section 9.7. Pericardial effusion is the most common manifestation of pericardial diseases during pregnancy. Effusions during 
pregnancy are typically benign, mild or moderate, and well tolerated, 
with spontaneous resolution after delivery, and no specific treatment 
is required in such cases. However, PEff may be associated with pre- 
eclampsia.665 Acute pericarditis is the second most common condition. 
Pre-conception counselling is essential in women of childbearing age 
with RP or previous myocarditis. In such cases, pregnancy should be 
planned in a phase of disease remission, and therapy should be reviewed. Pre-conception assessment should include multidisciplinary 
evaluation. Echocardiography is the preferred imaging method, while 
X-ray, CT scan, and CMR can be used in selected cases.666 
In patients with IMPS, vaginal delivery is not excluded in uncomplicated cases, while Caesarean section may be required in the presence 
of haemodynamic instability.666 Appropriate follow-up with a multidisciplinary team with experience in the field is recommended throughout 
pregnancy to ensure good maternal and foetal outcomes. 
High-dose aspirin or NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and indomethacin, 
can be used up to the 20th week of gestation. Corticosteroids at the 
minimal effective dose can be given in patients with active pericarditis 
throughout pregnancy along with NSAIDs and in selected cases colchicine. Azathioprine and IVIG are compatible with pregnancy and breastfeeding. All these medications, apart from high-dose aspirin, may be 
used during lactation. Colchicine is compatible with pregnancy and 
breastfeeding, and it can be continued throughout pregnancy to prevent recurrences.664,667–669 The use of IL-1 blockers during pregnancy 
is controversial. Available literature data seem encouraging; however, 
the relevant studies are scant and retrospective. Despite the limited evidence, anakinra may be continued through conception, pregnancy, and 
lactation in women with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who 
are not able to use alternative therapies.668–670 More details regarding 
drug dosages can be found in Supplementary data online, Table S16. 
There are no specific limitations for men with pericarditis who are 
planning to have children because they can safely continue 
therapy.667,668

12.4. The elderly 
Myocarditis is more prevalent in young people, with a median age between 20 and 40 years.28,55,63,73 In a Swedish study, 64% patients 
were younger than 50 years of age. In this study, HF/DCM and deaths 
occurred more commonly in patients aged >50 years.17 Myocarditis is 
probably more commonly related to drugs in the elderly, e.g. ICIs28,495 
and clozapine.508 Age- and sex-based differences have been evaluated in 
two studies with AP, and one study with RP.45,102,671 In these studies, 
elderly patients less often had chest pain, fever, ST elevation, and PR depression. They had lower C-reactive protein values but dyspnoea, AF, 
and PEff were more common. Moreover, they received glucocorticoids 
more commonly, and had a lower risk of recurrences compared with 
younger patients. In the elderly, therapy compliance may be problematic, because of cognitive impairment and comorbidities, but the strongest predictor of non-adherence is the number of medications.672 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used cautiously; dosing should be adapted (e.g. colchicine dose should be halved in some 
cases), and attention should be paid to evaluate renal impairment and 
drug interactions. 
12.5. Physical activity in inflammatory 
myopericardial syndrome 
Patients with active IMPS are advised to restrict physical activity. It has 
been proposed that exercise can aggravate myocardial and pericardial 
inflammation through several mechanisms, including a tachycardia- 
mediated process. The importance of controlling heart rate is confirmed by observational studies, in which the empirical use of 
β-blockers to control heart rate in patients with pericarditis improved 
symptom control.274 Previous recommendations have made distinctions between athletes and non-athletes, providing arbitrary times for 
abstention from 3 to 6 months. This TF recommends an individualized 
approach, based on remission times. A complete clinical remission 
should be considered in athletes/non-athletes with normalization of 
symptoms, biomarkers, and imaging. 
During the acute stage of myocarditis, patients are advised to rest 
completely, since exercise has been associated with arrhythmias and 
SCD. To ensure resolution of the disease, recovery should be monitored, including clinical assessment, rhythm control, laboratory analysis, 
and multimodality imaging (see Table 15). A personalized prescription 
of exercise should be performed, based on the patient (athletes, non- 
athletes), and type of exercise. 
12.5.1. Mental health effect of restricting exercise 
Exercise restriction can affect patient mental health, especially in children and young adults. It can lead to frustration, sadness, and depression in patients. Freedom to exercise should be approached with 
shared decision-making, taking into account the risk vs benefit ratio in 
the single case. 
12.6. Multidisciplinary teams for the 
management of inflammatory 
myopericardial syndrome 
It is recommended to have a multidisciplinary team for high-risk cases 
with IMPS. The team should be composed of a clinical cardiologist, a 
CMR imaging specialist with expertise in IMPS, a pathologist with expertise in cardiovascular diseases, and additionally, depending on the 
case, a rheumatologist (or clinical immunologist), an infectious disease 
specialist, a geneticist (or a cardiologist with expertise in genetics), 
interventional cardiologists (including electrophysiologists), and a cardiac intensive care specialist. A cardiac surgeon might be involved subsequently when interventional or surgical decisions are anticipated. 
More details are given in Figure 20. It is of paramount importance 
that physicians develop competence and skills in IMPS to allow timely 
diagnosis and therapy for patients, since mixed forms are common in 
clinical practice. Patient involvement is important, particularly when 
the evidence is scarce to foster shared decision-making.375,673,674 
Anti-inflammatory therapies should be considered in 
patients with pericarditis during lactation to treat and 
prevent pericarditis with timing adjusted to reduce 
drug exposure of the breastfed infant.

### 13 Advice for patients

Specific patient education is mandatory for patients with IMPS. Advice 
should address the causes, rationale for treatment, possible complications, and outcomes. Inflammatory myopericardial syndrome affects 
young patients and may severely affect their quality of life. Specific advice should be provided on the need for rest during the acute phase of 
the disease, and the timing for return to physical activity and work, as 
well as benefits and risks associated with tailored immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies, and when to contact the multidisciplinary team. Advice must be tailored to the specific social situation. 
Suitable language should be used, recognizing the patient’s educational 
status. Clarification based on images is preferrable. Care should be taken not to aggravate anxiety unnecessarily. An additional description 
and advice for patients with IMPS is provided in Supplementary data 
online, Section 8, Figure S6, and Table S17. A separate document dedicated to patients has been developed. 
14. Tertiary referral centres for 
inflammatory myopericardial 
syndrome: feature and volume of 
activity 
14.1. Tertiary care centres 
Tertiary care centres of excellence are extensive, renowned healthcare 
facilities that house specialized cardiology departments equipped to 
manage patients with IMPS. Leading institutions are recognized for their 
cardiovascular expertise and often handle patients with complex disease.674 Such centres have significant expertise in the diagnosis and 
therapy of myocarditis and pericarditis and are actively involved in research. They should be the referral centre of choice for complicated 
cases that cannot be managed by regional centres. Endomyocardial biopsy referral centres for deep investigation of EMB samples, including 
immunochemistry and molecular testing, should be identified at regional or national level. 
14.2. Inflammatory myopericardial 
syndrome in regional centres 
Most uncomplicated cases can be handled by regional centres, and depending on the healthcare systems, in outpatient departments. 
However, the crucial factor is the local expertise. At the same time, 
those with more severe pericarditis or myocarditis might need treatment at a hospital or tertiary care referral centre that has advanced 
multimodality imaging capacity and access to new therapeutic 
agents.674 
14.3. Hub-and-spoke model 
These centres should be capable of managing all care levels and adopt a 
hub-and-spoke model. Regardless of where care is provided, the goal is 
to sustain communication and collaboration throughout all healthcare 
system levels. The hub-and-spoke model aims to ease patient access 
to suitable care levels, promote care co-ordination, and drive quality 
enhancement for all patients with IMPS.674,675

14.4. Teamwork, competencies, and 
advances in imaging techniques 
Building a contemporary multidisciplinary team requires knowledge of 
recent advancements in imaging techniques, as well as evidence-based 
strategies for drug, interventional, and surgical therapies.63,674–676 
The conventional organization of academic or practice departments often operates in isolation, hindering the requirements of diseases that 
demand the insights and skills of a diverse expert panel. These centres 
should endorse a comprehensive team setup that encourages regular, 
ongoing communication among all members. The role of physician-led 
vs nurse-led tertiary centres should be explored further674,675 in view 
of the increasing number and complexity of these patients, and the utility of monitoring inflammatory markers and serial monitoring of cardiac 
imaging, even in an outpatient setting. 
15. Key messages 
The recognition of the whole spectrum of IMPS is increasing within the 
medical community. This is based on a deeper understanding leading to 
a more systematic evaluation, as well as more data being generated by 
prospective trials. Although these entities have been explored for some 
time, the COVID-19 pandemic was the main trigger to increase the 
awareness on the spectrum of disease. Advanced multimodality imaging 
technologies, including CMR, allow a patient-tailored diagnostic and 
therapeutic approach. A major diagnostic paradigm change is the capability of reaching a clinical diagnosis of certainty by non-invasive multimodality imaging (CMR for myocarditis), while EMB remains important 
in selected intermediate- and high-risk cases, if a targeted specific therapy, based on specific histotypes or aetiologies, is needed. 
15.1. Aetiology 
Inflammatory myopericardial syndrome is a spectrum of inflammatory 
diseases with some common aetiologies, either infectious or non- 
infectious, that can affect either the myocardium (myocarditis) or pericardium (pericarditis) in isolated forms, or combined (myopericarditis 
and perimyocarditis). 
15.2. Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
In a large percentage of cases, myocarditis and pericarditis have a chest 
pain presentation, and generally preserved biventricular function with 
good outcomes. For myocarditis, complicated forms include those presenting with severe HF and arrhythmias. Nevertheless, uncomplicated 
presentations may also develop life-threatening complications, albeit 
less commonly, and therefore also may need fast management. 
For pericarditis, complicated cases include those with an incessant or 
recurrent course. Many cases with persistent symptoms may show 
constrictive physiology, which can be reversible after appropriate medical therapy. The diagnosis of non-high-risk cases is based on clinical 
evaluation, including ECG and biomarkers, with non-invasive confirmation of the clinical suspicion by evidence of inflammatory involvement 
using multimodality imaging (mainly echocardiography and CMR). 
Endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for intermediate- and high- 
risk cases on a case-by-case decision, only when results are expected 
to change management. 
15.3. Therapy 
The treatment of uncomplicated IMPS is empirical, aiming at the control 
of symptoms and prevention of complications. Anti-inflammatory 
drugs and colchicine are useful to control chest pain, while additional 
therapies should be guideline-directed for specific complicated courses. 
If a specific aetiology is identified, treatment should be targeted at the 
specific cause. In all cases of IMPS, restriction of physical activity is recommended in the acute phase, while return to work and physical activity should be individualized according to clinical remission times. 
15.4. Prognosis and outcomes 
The prognosis of IMPS varies. Most patients presenting with chest pain 
have a favourable outcome, although recurrences, especially for pericarditis, may severely affect the quality of life of patients and require 
long-term follow-up. For complicated cases of myocarditis with HF 
and arrhythmias, a tailored and individualized approach is warranted. 
Such patients require long-term follow-up, usually lifetime monitoring. 
15.5. Multidisciplinary team 
Management of patients with IMPS should usually be guided by a multidisciplinary team, which should be tailored to the specific patient. This 
team should be composed of different clinicians, all with expertise in 
cardiovascular diseases (e.g. imaging experts, a pathologist, a rheumatologist, an infectious disease specialist, a geneticist, interventional cardiologists, intensive care specialists, and surgeons). It is of paramount 
importance that physicians develop competence and skills either in 
myocarditis or pericarditis to allow timely diagnosis and therapy for patients, because mixed forms are common in clinical practice. 
16. Gaps in evidence 
The field of IMPS has significant knowledge gaps across all aspects, from 
pathogenesis to therapy. However, growing awareness has led to numerous ongoing studies. Advances in multimodality imaging have enabled a more comprehensive and non-invasive understanding of 
disease progression, opening the way to patient-tailored approaches. 
Despite these advancements, large-scale prospective multicentre trials 
with predefined outcome measures are lacking. These uncertainties are 
especially pronounced in chronic conditions, as well as in specific patient groups, such as children, women of childbearing age, during pregnancy, lactating women, and in the elderly. 
A further challenge is the handling of the return to work and physical 
activity as there is a need for a patient-specific approach, taking into 
consideration the individual risk. Lessons learned from other diseases 
should lead to less restrictive guidance in comparison with previous 
advice. 
16.1. Myocarditis 
Knowledge about myocarditis has evolved during recent years, as the 
different mechanisms are better understood. Several causes, such as 
viral and toxic ones, including chemotherapy, as well as systemic disorders, have been investigated, and targeted therapeutic approaches 
were proposed. However, further research into specific therapy is 
needed based on advanced diagnostic approaches. 
Nevertheless, a specific challenge for myocarditis is related to the 
low frequency of complications and the high rate of spontaneous remission. On this basis, clinical trials on medical therapy for myocarditis 
might be currently underpowered to assess the clinical benefit of a specific treatment with small sample sizes. In addition, many antiviral therapies are off-label for myocarditis and controlled trials are missing.

Currently, quantitative immunohistochemistry criteria for the diagnosis of LM are under discussion among cardio-pathologists to present 
more definite criteria for EMB. 
Furthermore, a better understanding of the pathogenic and prognostic role of viral loads is needed (e.g. active/causative vs latent/innocent 
bystanders in cardiac viral infections). 
Moreover, the role of genetic predisposition in recurrent myocarditis is not thoroughly clarified. Research into the role of genetic predisposition is evolving to change the classification of disease and may 
influence therapeutic pathways in the future. An increase of ‘overlapping’ conditions, especially DCM and ARVC, can be expected and 
may change our understanding of the disease in the future. 
That means, more research is warranted on the prognosis and SCD 
risk stratification. 
16.2. Pericarditis 
There are significant knowledge gaps in individualized treatment and 
pathogenesis of various types of pericarditis, as well as the understanding of the interaction among genetic background, inflammation, and 
autoimmune mechanisms. Better knowledge of the pathogenesis of recurrences may also help to develop more targeted and individualized 
therapies. 
The genetic background requires further evaluation in complicated, 
recurrent cases and could be helpful to elucidate the mechanisms leading to incessant/recurrent forms. New therapeutic options should also 
be considered and evaluated in clinical trials to explore new drugs for 
more complicated, incessant, or recurrent cases to develop a more individualized and efficacious approach for the treatment of pericarditis. 
A significant management issue is the treatment of patients not responding to colchicine and anti-IL-1 agents, as well as the causes of 
drug dependence to maintain stable clinical remission, such as for corticosteroids and anti-IL-1 agents. 
Additional research is also warranted to understand the prognostic 
significance of persistent LGE of the pericardium. 
There are limited data to support the best timing of return to work 
and physical activity, and further research is needed on this topic with 
appropriate clinical trials or observational studies. 
17. Sex differences 
There is limited published evidence on this topic. Inflammatory myopericardial syndrome seems to affect males more than females from 
a young age. Myocarditis complicated by VA is more common in males, 
while in females, a relatively higher proportion of cases presents with 
complicated forms compared with males, and systemic autoimmune 
disorders are more commonly diagnosed. This was addressed in the 
relevant sections. The diagnostic approaches are similar, but care 
should be taken when applying normal values, especially in imaging. 
Medication should be adapted in women of childbearing age, pregnancy, 
and during lactation (more details are specified in specific sections).

Disclaimer The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines represent the views of the ESC and were produced after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and 
the evidence available at the time of their publication. The ESC is not responsible in the event of any contradiction, discrepancy and/or ambiguity between the ESC Guidelines and any other 
official recommendations or guidelines issued by the relevant public health authorities, in particular in relation to good use of healthcare or therapeutic strategies. Health professionals are 
encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies; however, the ESC Guidelines do not override, in any way whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions 
in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient and, where appropriate and/or necessary, the patient’s caregiver. Nor do the ESC Guidelines exempt 
health professionals from taking into full and careful consideration the relevant official updated recommendations or guidelines issued by the competent public health authorities, in order to 
manage each patient’s case in light of the scientifically accepted data pursuant to their respective ethical and professional obligations. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the 
applicable rules and regulations relating to drugs and medical devices prior to making any clinical decision and to check whether a more recent version of this document exists. The ESC warns 
readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect.

1. Preamble 
Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim 
of assisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or 
therapeutic approach for an individual patient with a given condition. 
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines are intended for 
use by health professionals but do not override their individual responsibility to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with the 
patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the 
rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices 
at the time of prescription and to respect the ethical rules of their 
profession. 
ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given 
topic. Guideline topics are selected for updating after annual expert review of new evidence conducted by the ESC Clinical Practice 
Guidelines (CPG) Committee. European Society of Cardiology 
Policies and Procedures for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines 
can be found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/ 
Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/ 
Writing-ESC-Guidelines). 
This guideline updates and replaces the previous version from 2018. 
This Task Force was selected by the ESC to include professionals 
involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology and to include patient representatives and methodologists. The selection procedure included an open call for authors and aimed to include members from 
across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty 
Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion. 
Guidelines Task Forces perform a critical review and evaluation of 
the published literature on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches 
including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Recommendations 
are based on major randomized trials and relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses, when available. Systematic literature 
searches are conducted in cases of controversy or uncertainty to 
ensure that all key studies were considered. For recommendations 
related to diagnosis and prognosis, additional types of evidence 
are included, such as diagnostic accuracy studies and studies focused 
on the development and validation of prognostic models. The 
strength of each recommendation and the level of evidence supporting it are weighed and scored according to predefined criteria as 
outlined in Tables 1 and 2. Patient-reported outcome measures 
(PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are 
also evaluated when available as the basis for recommendations 
and/or discussion in these guidelines. 
Evidence tables summarizing key information from relevant studies 
are generated to facilitate the formulation of recommendations, to enhance comprehension of recommendations after publication, and to

reinforce transparency in the guidelines’ development process. The tables are published in their own section of ESC Guidelines and reference 
specific recommendation tables. 
After an iterative process of deliberations, a first Task Force vote on all 
recommendations is conducted prior to the initiation of rounds of review. A second Task Force vote on all recommendations is conducted 
after the final round of review and revision. For each vote, the Task 
Force follows ESC voting procedures and all recommendations require 
at least 75% agreement among voting members to be approved. 
Voting restrictions may be applied based on declarations of interests. 
The writing and reviewing panels provide declaration of interest 
forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential 
sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest are reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules, which can 
be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/doi) and are 
compiled in a report published in a supplementary document with the 
guidelines. Funding for the development of ESC Guidelines is derived entirely from the ESC with no involvement of the healthcare industry. 
The CPG Committee supervises and coordinates the preparation of 
new guidelines and approves their publication. In addition to review by 
the CPG Committee, ESC Guidelines undergo multiple rounds of 
double-blind peer review on a dedicated online review platform. The review is conducted by topic experts, including members from ESC 
National Cardiac Societies and from relevant ESC Subspecialty 
Communities. Guideline Task Forces consider all review comments 
and are required to respond to all those classified as major. After appropriate revisions, the Task Force and the CPG Committee members approve the final document for publication in the European Heart Journal. 
Unless otherwise stated, ESC Guidelines content refers to sex, 
understood as the biological condition of being male or female, defined 
by genes, hormones, and sexual organs. Off-label use of medication may 
be presented in this guideline if a sufficient level of evidence shows that 
it can be considered medically appropriate for a given condition. 
However, decisions on off-label use must be made by the responsible 
health professional giving special consideration to ethical rules concerning healthcare, the specific situation of the patient, patient consent, and 
country-specific health regulations. 
2. Introduction 
2.1. Why we need new Guidelines on 
cardiovascular disease and pregnancy 
Since the previous version of these Guidelines was published in 2018, 
new evidence has emerged, and clinical focus has changed in various aspects, requiring an updated discussion. These include the importance of 
the Pregnancy Heart Team, the modalities for pre-pregnancy counselling and risk stratification, and drugs during pregnancy, lactation and/or 
breastfeeding, and post-partum stages. In Table 3, the most relevant updates are listed with their respective rationale. 
2.2. Why these Guidelines are important 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of maternal mortality 
and morbidity. With these new Guidelines we wish to provide updated 
evidence-based guidance for patients and caregivers. Reducing maternal 
mortality and morbidity is a key priority of the World Health 
Organization (WHO). 
In managing maternal and foetal health, it is essential to balance the 
risks and benefits of maternal and foetal therapeutic needs. Due to 
the scarcity of prospective or randomized studies within this field, 
which often cannot be performed for ethical reasons, most recommendations in these Guidelines are based on evidence level 
C. Consequently, there is an ongoing need for more registries, such 
as the Registry of Pregnancy and Cardiac Disease (ROPAC) and the 
European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies network, and prospective studies to enhance our understanding in this area. 
2.3. What is new 
As mentioned in Section 2.1, this new version of the guidelines not only 
includes an update to several recommendations (Table 4) but also introduces a structural revision. See Supplementary data online 
(Table S1) for a detailed overview of the new recommendations. 
Below we discuss the key updates per section, highlighting a selection 
of new and revised recommendations along with their rationale.

Section 4. The Pregnancy Heart Team 
Although the concept of the Pregnancy Heart Team was previously part of the general principles, it has now been given its own dedicated section, which covers all 
aspects from pre-conception through to the postpartum period. 
A discussion by the Pregnancy Heart Team about the high risk of maternal mortality or morbidity and the related high foetal risk is 
recommended for women with mWHO 2.0 class IV conditions, including a shared decision-making process for pregnancy termination, 
involving psychological support. 
I 
C 
It is recommended that women with CVD of mWHO 2.0 class II–III and above are evaluated and managed by a Pregnancy Heart Team from 
pre-pregnancy onwards through pregnancy and post-partum. 
I 
C 
Measurement of BNP and NT-proBNP levels should be considered prior to pregnancy in women with HF of any aetiology, including 
previous PPCM, cardiomyopathy, ACHD, and PAH, and be monitored during pregnancy according to the underlying disorder and in case of 
new-onset or worsening symptoms. 
IIa

Section 5. Drugs during pregnancy and lactation 
Given the importance of medication use throughout this document, this section has been brought forward and revised. The former comprehensive medication 
table has been moved to the Supplementary data online, and we provide a summary figure (Figure 6) listing the (contra)indicated medications. 
Section 6. Pregnancy in women with cardiomyopathies and primary arrhythmia syndromes 
This section has been expanded since 2018 for advice in specific cardiomyopathies and primary arrhythmias. 
Vaginal delivery is recommended in most women with CMPs, unless there are obstetric indications for caesarean section, severe HF 
(EF <30% and/or NYHA class III/IV), uncontrolled arrhythmias, or severe outflow obstruction (≥50 mmHg) in women with HCM, or in 
women presenting in labour on VKAs.

Recommendations for cardiac arrest and pregnancy 
Continuous manual left uterine displacement during CPR in pregnant women (≥20 weeks) with cardiac arrest is recommended to relieve 
aortocaval compression. 
I 
C 
It is recommended to establish i.v. access above the diaphragm to ensure that the i.v. therapy is not obstructed by the gravid uterus. 
I 
C 
It is recommended that no drugs are withheld in pregnant women with cardiac arrest due to concerns of teratogenicity. 
I 
C 
Recommendation for congenital atrioventricular block and pregnancy

rate (≥50 b.p.m.) a prophylactic temporary pacemaker during delivery is not recommended. 
III 
C 
Recommendation for native valve disease and pregnancy 
Valve surgery during pregnancy should only be considered when there is a maternal mortality risk and other treatment options have failed. 
IIa 
C 
Recommendation for prosthetic valves disease and pregnancy 
It is recommended that a care plan documenting the agreed anticoagulant strategy (including the decision to continue VKAs or converting to 
therapeutic-dose LMWH in the first trimester) is in place for women of childbearing age with a MHV prior to pregnancy or as soon as 
pregnancy is recognized. 
I 
C 
Recommendations for chronic and acute heart failure and pregnancy 
Inotropes and/or vasopressors are recommended in pregnant women with cardiogenic shock with levosimendan, dobutamine, and 
milrinone as recommended agents.

### 3 General considerations

3.1. Epidemiology 
Within high-income countries the number of pregnancies and deliveries in 
women with acquired, congenital, or inherited CVD is growing significantly.19–21 This trend originates from several factors: higher maternal age at 
first pregnancy, a growing number of women with congenital heart disease 
reaching childbearing age, and a rising prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities.19–21 Globally, up to 4% of pregnancies are complicated by 
CVD, rising to 10% when including hypertensive disorders.22–25 
Maternal CVD is now the leading cause of non-obstetric mortality in pregnant women24,26, accounting for 33% of pregnancy-related deaths worldwide.25,27,28 In women with pre-existing CVD, up to 16% of pregnancies 
are complicated by CVD.29–32 Notably, 68% of pregnancy-related deaths 
caused by CVD are preventable.33 Women with CVD during pregnancy 
face higher risk of cardiac events later in life, making secondary prevention 
crucial.25 Adverse neonatal outcomes occur in ∼25% of these pregnancies 
in women with CVD34,35 with high rates of obstetric complications (17%) 
and maternal mortality/morbidity (11%).34,35 Of note, recent research indicates that pre-existing CVD in the mother is associated with an increased risk of CVD in her children, and this association is unlikely to be 
explained by unmeasured familial or genetic factors.36 
3.2. Physiology of pregnancy 
Pregnancy induces physiological changes in the cardiovascular system to 
meet the increased metabolic needs of the mother and foetus (Figure 1). 
These changes occur from the early stages of pregnancy onward. Starting 
at 6 weeks of gestation, stroke volume and cardiac output (CO) increase 
Section 8. Recommendations for aortopathies, cardiac surgery, and pregnancy 
Pregnancy is not recommended in patients with 
vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. 
III 
C 
It is recommended that women with vascular Ehlers– 
Danlos syndrome wishing to become pregnant are 
counselled regarding the very high risk of 
pregnancy-related adverse events by a multidisciplinary 
team, considering family history, genetic variant, and 
previous vascular events. 
I 
C 
Beta-blocker therapy throughout pregnancy should be 
considered in women with Marfan syndrome and other 
heritable thoracic aortic diseases. 
IIa 
C 
Beta-blocker therapy throughout pregnancy and in the 
post-partum period is recommended in women with 
MFS and other HTADs. 
I 
C 
Section 9. Recommendations for congenital heart disease and pregnancy 
Patients with a systemic right ventricle (Mustard/ 
Senning or congenitally corrected TGA), in NYHA class 
III/IV, systemic ventricular dysfunction (EF <40%), or 
severe TR should be advised against pregnancy. 
IIa 
C 
It is recommended that women with a systemic RV 
(Mustard/Senning or congenitally corrected TGA), in 
NYHA class III/IV, systemic ventricular dysfunction 
(EF <40%), or severe TR wishing to become pregnant 
are counselled by the Pregnancy Heart Team regarding 
the high risk of pregnancy-related adverse events. 
I 
C 
Section 12. Recommendations for acquired heart disease and pregnancy 
An invasive management strategy should be considered 
for NSTE ACS with high-risk criteria. 
IIa 
C 
It is recommended to manage pregnant women with 
ACS in the same way as non-pregnant women, including 
diagnostic investigations and interventions. 
I 
C 
Catheter ablation with electro-anatomical systems 
should be considered in experienced centres in cases of 
drug-refractory and poorly tolerated SVT. 
IIa 
C 
Catheter ablation may be considered in pregnant 
women with recurrent, long symptomatic SVT or with 
contraindications to pharmacological therapies. 
IIb 
C 
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty should be considered 
during pregnancy in patients with severe aortic stenosis 
and severe symptoms. 
IIa 
C 
In very selected symptomatic pregnant women with 
severe aortic stenosis not responding to medical 
therapy, non-surgical options such as balloon 
valvuloplasty or TAVI may be considered. 
IIb

by 30%–50%, and heart rate increases by 10–20 beats per minute. 
Peripheral vascular resistance decreases by 20%–50%.37 
Left and right atrial and ventricular diameters and volumes increase 
while ventricular function is preserved.38 Blood pressure and CO increase during labour.39 After delivery, the uterus contracts, and CO 
drops rapidly to ∼15%–25% above normal. A gradual decrease of 
CO follows over the next 3–4 weeks and reaches pre-pregnancy levels 
at ∼6 weeks post-partum. 
In women with heart disease, left and right ventricular adaptation to 
pregnancy can be suboptimal and can lead to heart failure (HF) and 
atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Atrial arrhythmias may develop 
in response to cardiac stretch and hormonal changes in pregnancy and 
may not be well tolerated in women with CVD. The haemodynamic 
and hormonal changes during pregnancy are risk factors for aortic dissection in women with aortopathy.40 Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable 
state associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism.41 
Increased activity of gastrointestinal–hepatic metabolism, liver enzyme 
systems, glomerular filtration rate and plasma volume, changes in protein binding, and decreased serum albumin levels all contribute to 
changes in the pharmacokinetics of many drugs.42

### 4 The Pregnancy Heart Team

4.1. Concept and requirements 
The central role of the Pregnancy Heart Team is illustrated in  
Figure 2. The concept of the Pregnancy Heart Team was first introduced in the 2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy.43 It has become an established 
component in the care of women with CVD or those who develop 
cardiovascular problems during pregnancy.44–49 This care provision 
commences prior to pregnancy and persists through the post- 
partum period. Research has shown that management by a 
Pregnancy Heart Team is associated with favourable maternal, foetal, 
and healthcare services outcomes, including lowered maternal mortality and readmission rates and subsequently improved patient 
safety.50 Institutional Pregnancy Heart Teams should be established 
in referral hospitals, taking into account the geographical regions, 
disciplines represented, and numbers of births, as well as sociocultural aspects.44,45,47–49 Maintaining a balance between the need for 
follow-up by such teams and the workload on these teams is crucial, 
emphasizing the importance of carefully selecting women who should 
be directed to a Pregnancy Heart Team. Patient selection is best accomplished by a risk assessment using the modified World Health 
Organization (mWHO) 2.0 classification (Table 6). The Pregnancy 
Heart Team should encompass a core team that can be expanded 
with other experts (see Figure 3), tailored to women’s physical and 
mental health or emerging complications.53 
The primary responsibilities of the Pregnancy Heart Team encompass 
risk assessment, collaborative care plan development, continuous 
progress monitoring, coordination, patient education, and psychological counselling. A staged approach is recommended, from 
pre-conception and pregnancy through to labour, delivery, and 
post-partum care. Promoting shared decision-making is essential 
at all stages. Not every hospital needs to establish a dedicated 
Pregnancy Heart Team, but each hospital should establish communication and collaboration with nearby expert teams, optimizing 
emergency and elective referral pathways within a shared-approach 
care model. 
4.2. Pre-pregnancy counselling and family 
planning 
Women should receive pre-pregnancy counselling and education about 
the maternal, foetal, and transmission risk(s).54 In adolescents diagnosed 
with congenital or inherited heart disease, tailored discussions about reproductive health should start early, ideally from menarche. Girls and women with congenital heart disease may not demonstrate appropriate 
understanding of safe contraception and pregnancy risk. High rates of unintended pregnancies (up to 45%) have been reported in adolescents 
with congenital heart disease.55 Transition programmes showed improved disease-related knowledge levels in adolescents with congenital 
heart disease.56–58 
4.2.1. Risk assessment 
A personalized pregnancy-related risk assessment is needed in all women with CVD and should encompass the specific cardiovascular diagnosis, functional status, and medication regimen, as well as non-cardiac 
risk factors such as maternal age, smoking history, comorbidities, body 
mass index (BMI), obstetric history, logistical care aspects, maternal 
ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. It is also crucial to integrate foetal 
and obstetric outcomes with specific cardiovascular considerations. 
Maternal preferences should be thoroughly explored as part of the 
shared decision-making process. 
4.2.1.1. Maternal risk assessment 
Depending on the diagnosis, a cardiovascular assessment may include imaging, biomarker-level assessment, and functional testing. Cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing can be useful for pre-pregnancy risk stratification.59,60 
Assessment may include re-evaluation after discontinuation of teratogenic 
medications and whether pre-pregnancy intervention is required. 
Various scoring systems are available to assess maternal risk and foetal 
risk. These do not fully explore the interaction with non-cardiac risk factors, 
only focus on maternal cardiac events, and have mainly been validated in 
higher-income countries. Further adaptation and validation in other countries may be required.51 Despite these limitations, disease-specific risks can 
be effectively assessed using the mWHO classification, validated as the 
best-available risk assessment model.1,61 However, the mWHO classification is oriented towards adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) and identifying those at the highest risk. Therefore, the mWHO 2.0 classification has 
now been expanded with other CVDs and refined by integrating the 
Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy study (CARPREG) II (Table 6).52 Specific expertise and collaborative management by a Pregnancy Heart Team is mandatory for all women with a condition of mWHO 2.0 class II–III or above. 
4.2.2. Genetic counselling 
Several CVDs have a genetic basis, including heritable cardiac conditions 
such as some aortopathies, channelopathies, cardiomyopathies, congenital 
heart disease, and subsets of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and 
thromboembolic disease. Most show autosomal dominant inheritance 
with a 50% transmission risk. Knowledge of an underlying pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic (P/LP) variant (adjusted terminology for mutation) is of increasing importance to better assess pregnancy-related outcomes and to adjust 
management (Figure 4).62,63 Therefore, it is recommended that genetic 
testing for CVD is performed pre-pregnancy in a specialized cardiogenetic 
centre or a network model with access to a multidisciplinary team, involving appropriately trained professionals with expertise in genetic testing 
methodology, sequence variant interpretation, clinical application of genetic testing, and pre- and post-testing genetic counselling about the transmission risk and the variable expression of an inherited genetic condition.64,65 
4.2.2.1. Pre-natal and pre-implantation diagnosis 
A timely discussion about pre-implantation (or pre-gestational) genetic 
testing and pre-natal testing should be offered to every woman and/or 
couple when there is a known parental monogenic or chromosomal abnormality. Pre-implantation genetic testing requires in vitro fertilization 
(IVF). The modalities of pre-natal and pre-implantation testing, including 
precautions, are summarized in Table 7. The decision whether to pursue pre-implantation or pre-natal genetic testing should include consideration of a spectrum of aspects related to the disease, including 
cultural, religious, and legal issues, but also accessibility of required techniques and expertise.67 Counselling should be provided at an experienced centre with an expert multidisciplinary team. An individualized 
approach is required to ensure autonomous choice and informed 
decision-making within the local ethical and legal framework. Several 
of these options take time and require early referral. 
4.2.3. Reproductive technology 
Infertility rates in most women with CVD are similar to 
those in the general population, but managing infertility and 
medically assisted reproductive treatment is more complex.68

Nevertheless, women with CVD requesting reproductive treatment 
should not be turned down based on assumed cardiovascular risk until their case has been discussed in a multidisciplinary setting involving 
the Pregnancy Heart Team. 
Assisted reproduction has added risks above those of pregnancy 
alone; superovulation is pro-thrombotic and can be complicated by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, with marked fluid shifts and a high 
thrombosis risk. All women with CVD who are embarking on fertility 
treatment should have an individual risk assessment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) given the risk associated with these techniques.69 The 
risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can be reduced by careful cycle monitoring, using a low-dose follicle-stimulating hormone in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist. Transferring 
a single embryo is strongly advised in women with CVD, as carrying 
multiple gestations is associated with greater cardiovascular changes 
and more maternal and foetal complications.70,71 
In women with mWHO 2.0 class III conditions or those who are anticoagulated (Table 6), the risk of complications from superovulation is 
very high. It is therefore recommended that these women have a full 
pre-pregnancy assessment by a Pregnancy Heart Team prior to the

procedure, including an evaluation of the risk of hormonal treatment. 
The option of natural cycle IVF should be considered. Hysteroscopy 
and laparoscopy can be life-threatening procedures in women with specific cardiac conditions, such as a Fontan circulation, and should only be 
undertaken in an experienced centre with appropriate support. 
Fertility treatment should be avoided in women with mWHO 2.0 
class IV conditions. 
4.2.4. Contraception 
To ensure informed decision-making about pregnancy, accurate 
counselling about contraception should be provided to all girls 
and women of childbearing age with CVD, starting from menarche, 
to prevent unplanned pregnancies. An overview of the benefits and 
risks of different types of contraception in women with CVD is provided in Table 8. 
4.2.5. Termination of pregnancy including 
psychological support 
It is strongly recommended to consider and discuss termination of 
pregnancy with women whose risk is classified as mWHO 2.0 class 
IV due to the exceptionally elevated risk of maternal and foetal mortality or severe morbidity.83 Efforts should be made to minimize delays for women seeking pregnancy termination because the risk of 
procedure-related complications increases as gestational age advances. Surgical methods are often preferred, but pharmacological 
methods remain an option until the ninth week of pregnancy.83 
Given the emotional and psychological impact of pregnancy termination, it is crucial to provide professional psychosocial support, which 
plays a significant role in reducing adverse mental health outcomes.89 
At the same time a discussion should be held regarding appropriate 
contraception.

4.3. Diagnostic methods in pregnancy 
The pros and cons of the primary cardiovascular diagnostic methods 
for diagnosing cardiovascular disease in pregnancy are described here. 
Pre-pregnancy evaluation is covered in the risk assessment section 
(Section 4.2.1). 
4.3.1. Electrocardiogram, including mobile rhythm 
devices 
Pregnant women may present changes in their surface electrocardiogram (ECG), including increased heart rate, minor leftward QRS axis 
shift (15–20 degrees), slightly decreased (20 ms) PR interval, prominent 
Q waves in II, III, and aVF, and flat or inverted T-waves in III, aVF, V1, V2, 
and V3 (Figure 1).96–98 
A 12-lead ECG is part of the standard evaluation of pregnant women 
presenting with new-onset cardiac signs or symptoms or suspected arrhythmia. In pregnant women presenting with syncope or palpitations, 
long-term Holter monitoring or implantable loop recorders should be 
considered as additional diagnostic tools. As pregnant women are more 
prone to arrhythmias, the threshold to perform long-term ambulatory 
rhythm monitoring should be low. 
4.3.2. Echocardiography 
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first-line imaging method 
used in pregnancy.99,100 Physiological changes in cardiac geometry and 
functioning are expected during pregnancy (Figure 1).99,101–103 These 
are greatest early in the third trimester and resolve early post-partum. 
Agitated saline contrast should not be used during pregnancy, given 
the risk of placental infarction due to microbubble embolism, resulting 
in foetal distress.99,104 Relevant foetal exposure to intravenous (i.v.) 
echocardiographic contrast agents is not expected due to their very 
short half-life.105 Nevertheless, these agents should only be used selectively because studies during pregnancy or lactation are lacking.99 
Transoesophageal echocardiography is relatively safe, but the potential 
risks and benefits must be weighed individually, including the risk of emesis/aspiration and sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure. 
Speckle-tracking echocardiography is a useful method to detect subclinical myocardial abnormalities in pregnancy.106,107 
4.3.3. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing 
If there is suspicion of new-onset CVD during pregnancy, submaximal 
exercise testing (at 80% of predicted maximal heart rate) can be useful 
to assess cardiovascular response to exercise. There is no evidence that 
exercise testing increases the risk of spontaneous miscarriage.108,109 
Stress echocardiography using bicycle ergometry may improve diagnostic specificity. The use of pharmacologic stress agents (e.g. dobutamine) 
should be avoided.99,110 There is no evidence supporting a preference 
for treadmill over bicycle exercise testing during pregnancy. The choice 
should be based on women’s individual risk factors, contraindications, 
pregnancy stage, and local availability of testing and expertise. 
4.3.4. Biomarkers 
Throughout pregnancy and the early post-partum stages, natriuretic 
peptide [NP: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro- 
brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)] values within the normal range 
have a strong negative predictive value for heart failure whereas the 
positive predictive value tends to be lower.111,112 In women with pre- 
existing cardiomyopathy, ACHD, or valvular heart disease, baseline as a 
minimum and serial NP measurements on an individualized basis should 
be considered to diagnose cardiac complications during pregnancy and 
post-partum.113–118 
Although cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) are 
essential in diagnosing myocardial ischaemia, standardized values in pregnancy and post-partum have not been established.112,119 Therefore, routine use of troponins alone during pregnancy is not recommended. 
D-dimer testing has relevance in the diagnosis of VTE (see Section  
11), taking into account the physiological increase during pregnancy, 
particularly in the third trimester. 
4.3.5. Ionizing radiation exposure 
Risks of ionizing radiation exposure are highest during organogenesis 
and decrease with time.120,121 Exposing the foetus to radiation doses 
>150–200 mGy may result in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), 
congenital malformations (in particular of the central nervous system), 
and malignancies. If possible, procedures should be delayed at least until 
the completion of major organogenesis (>12 weeks of gestation). 
However, the safety of the woman is important and should guide the 
clinical decision. All radiation doses to the foetus must be kept ‘as 
low as reasonably achievable’ (ALARA) (preferably <50 mGy) and 
should be clearly documented. Manoeuvres to minimize radiation are: 
(i) use echo guidance when possible; (ii) place the source as far and 
the receiver as close as possible to the patient; (iii) use only low-dose 
fluoroscopy (7.5 frames per second or lower); (iv) favour anteroposterior projections; (v) avoid direct radiation of the abdominal region (abdominal shielding is of limited benefit due to internal scatter from 
thoracic tissues rather than direct foetal irradiation); (vi) collimate as 
tightly as possible to the area of interest; (vii) minimize fluoroscopy 
time; and (viii) ensure the procedure is performed by an experienced 
cardiologist.122–126 Iodinated contrast can cross the placenta, but has 
not been reported to have teratogenic effects.127 The potential risk 
of congenital hypothyroidism is unclear but no abnormalities of foetal 
thyroid function after application have been reported.122,128,129 
4.3.5.1. Chest radiography 
The chest radiograph is a practical and readily available diagnostic tool 
for evaluating cardiopulmonary diseases. The foetal dose from chest 
radiography is <0.01 mGy. Nevertheless, it should only be performed 
in symptomatic women if other methods fail to clarify the cause of 
the symptoms. 
Lung ultrasound is a valuable tool for diagnosing pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, pneumothorax, and pneumonia. However, there is 
currently a lack of data about the regular ultrasound pattern during 
pregnancy,130,131 and lung ultrasound is therefore not recommended 
as an alternative to chest radiography. 
Protection of the foetus is governed by radiological standards. Both 
the technician and the radiologist should act accordingly. 
4.3.5.2. Computed tomography and nuclear medicine  
imaging 
The radiation dose to the foetus from a chest computed tomography 
(CT) or pulmonary CT angiography is estimated at 0.02 mGy.121 
Technetium-99m, used for ventilation–perfusion lung scanning for detection of pulmonary embolism, results in an embryonic or foetal exposure of <5 mGy, which is considered a safe dose in pregnancy. 
Computed tomography or nuclear medicine techniques are generally  
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               23

### Page 24

not recommended during pregnancy. However, if such techniques are 
necessary because other diagnostic tools are insufficient or not readily 
available for the diagnosis in question, they should not be withheld from 
a pregnant patient.100,132 
4.3.5.3. Cardiac catheterization 
Cardiac catheterization is seldom needed during pregnancy but may be 
necessary for specific diagnostic and interventional purposes. Foetal 
compromise decreases with gestational age. The highest risk is <20 
weeks gestation and is proportional to the radiation dose, with no reports of foetal anomalies or loss when exposure is <50 mGy.133,134 
Most coronary procedures can be performed within these dose limits 
and radiation exposure to the foetus itself is estimated to be lower than 
20%. The radial approach by an experienced operator is preferable and 
every effort to reduce radiation exposure should be made. 
4.3.6. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance 
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is advised if other non-invasive 
diagnostic measures are insufficient to provide a clinical diagnosis and is 
preferable to radiation-based imaging modalities.99,100,135 It seems prudent 
to avoid a scanner strength higher than 1.5 tesla due to the greater energy 
deposition in tissue. Evidence regarding gadolinium-based contrast in pregnancy is controversial and its use should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.135–137 Excretion of gadolinium-based agents into breast milk is 
limited (<0.04% of an i.v. dose within the first 24 h, with 1%–2% absorption).138 Lactating women receiving intravascular gadolinium should discontinue lactation for 24 h.133,138,139 
4.4. Foetal assessment 
4.4.1. Risk of foetal/obstetric complications 
The typical increase in CO during pregnancy may not occur optimally in some women with CVD, potentially affecting uteroplacental 
blood flow. These and other cardiovascular risk factors contribute 
to an increased risk of obstetric and foetal complications, including 
foetal loss, stillbirth, pre-term birth, pre-eclampsia, and IUGR.140 
Furthermore, the severity of obstetric and foetal outcomes varies 
depending on the maternal risk as defined in the mWHO 2.0 classification. Adverse outcomes are more frequent in women with a 
higher mWHO 2.0 classification, emphasizing the importance of 
risk stratification, comprehensive counselling, and multidisciplinary 
management, including neonatology expertise.2,134,140 Notably, pulmonary hypertension (PH) represents one of the highest risks for 
obstetric and foetal complications.141 The main predictors of neonatal complications are indicated in Table 9. 
4.4.2. Screening for congenital heart disease in the 
foetus 
Foetal echocardiography should routinely be offered at 18–22 weeks 
when parents have congenital heart disease. This will detect up to 
80% of significant congenital cardiac defects.142–144 
4.4.3. Assessing foetal well-being 
Detailed anatomical foetal assessment is required in women using cardiac 
medication with teratogenic effects (see Section 5 for more details).145

In women with beta-blocker exposure, higher small for gestational age 
(SGA) rates and, more rarely, bradycardia have been reported, indicating the need for appropriate foetal monitoring.12,146 Foetal ductus venosus Doppler velocity is a useful adjunct to evaluate foetal well-being and 
determine the time to delivery in cases of increased risk of IUGR.147 
4.4.4. Foetal assessment of heritable primary 
arrhythmias 
In families with primary arrhythmia, the foetus may present with arrhythmias. Therefore, the foetal heart rate should be assessed at baseline 
and during each pre-natal visit and compared against gestation-specific 
norms. In pregnancies complicated by suspected primary arrhythmia- 
related foetal arrhythmias, complete foetal echocardiography, typically 
performed at 20–22 weeks, is recommended to evaluate heart anatomy, 
ventricular function, and the arrhythmia mechanism.148 Foetal magnetocardiography, if available, offers valuable insights into arrhythmia type and 
severity and monitors anti-arrhythmic drug therapy, as it captures all cardiac time intervals (P, QRS, T-wave) between 17 and 24 weeks of gestation. It is currently the only method to detect repolarization 
abnormalities, such as QT interval prolongation.149 
4.5. Timing and mode of delivery 
An individualized delivery plan should be made that covers the needs 
for induction of labour, labour management, delivery, and post-partum 
surveillance, in shared decision-making with the pregnant women. This 
delivery plan should be widely accessible to the patient, her partner, and 
relevant health professionals, and should be placed in the patient’s 
(electronic) health record. 
4.5.1. Timing of delivery 
Pregnant women with CVD are more likely to have comorbidities and 
experience adverse events during delivery than those without CVD, 
and require additional monitoring and care.150 Any maternal benefit 
of early term delivery (from 37 weeks 0 days to 38 weeks 6 days of gestation) should be weighed against the increased likelihood of adverse 
foetal outcomes.151 Induction of labour between 39 and 40 weeks reduces the risk of emergency caesarean section by 12% and the risk of 
stillbirth by 50% in women without CVD. The benefit is likely to be 
greater for women with CVD who have higher rates of obstetric complications.152,153 In the absence of maternal or foetal indications for 
early birth, induction of labour before 39 weeks should be reserved 
for obstetrical indications.154 
4.5.2. Induction of labour 
Mechanical methods, prostaglandin E1 analogue (misoprostol), 
slow-release formulation of 10 mg prostaglandin E2 (dinoprostone), 
oxytocin, and artificial rupture of membranes are all considered safe 
to induce labour.4,155,156 High-dose (600 mg) misoprostol does not affect cardiac parameters in women without heart disease, although 
there remains a theoretical risk of coronary vasospasm and arrhythmias.155 Dinoprostone may cause profound hypotension, but only 
when injected blindly into the myometrium, and this route of administration should be avoided.157 The use of an additional 2 IU of oxytocin 
for the management of the third stage in women with CVD has no cardiac consequences and is associated with significantly lower blood 
loss.158 In women at high risk (mWHO 2.0 classes III–IV), oxytocin is 
generally considered as a first-line uterotonic, misoprostol and carboprost are second line (see Supplementary data online, Table S3).159 
Mechanical methods such as a cervical ripening balloon might be preferable in women where a drop in systemic vascular resistance would be 
detrimental.160 If membranes are ruptured, augmentation of labour 
should be immediate to reduce the risk of infection and should be undertaken with oxytocin to minimize the number of vaginal examinations.4 
4.5.3. Vaginal or caesarean delivery 
Vaginal delivery is associated with less blood loss and lower risk of infections and venous thromboembolism and should be advised for 
most women.161 Planned caesarean section does not confer any advantage over planned vaginal delivery in terms of maternal outcomes and 
may be associated with adverse foetal outcomes.162,163 
Caesarean section is the preferred mode of delivery for obstetric indications and for women presenting in labour who use or have used 
vitamin K antagonist (VKA) within the past 2 weeks, with high-risk aortopathy (mWHO 2.0 class III), with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM) and severe left ventricle outflow tract obstruction, or in acute 
intractable HF.43 
4.5.4. Haemodynamic monitoring during delivery 
Pulse oximetry, blood pressure monitoring, and continuous ECG monitoring may help detect early signs of decompensation, arrhythmias, and 
ischaemia in women with significant CVD and identify those in whom 
delivery should be expedited.164 Arterial lines should be reserved for 
those women who have haemodynamic instability or are at risk of it. 
A right-heart catheter is of uncertain benefit, is associated with complications, and should be avoided in most cases. Minimally invasive CO 
monitoring is preferable, where possible.110 
4.5.5. Anaesthesia/analgesia 
Analgesia is crucial for labour in pregnant women with CVD to reduce 
physical stress. Neuraxial methods are very effective analgesic blocks. 
The onset of conventional epidural analgesia is relatively slow (±15 min) 
and allows for careful titration of a local anaesthetic–opioid mix.165 
Spinal analgesia is suitable for women with high-risk CVD, where a faster 
onset of sympathetic block is desirable.166 Combined spinal–epidural 
analgesia typically has a faster onset time (±5 min). However, adverse 
effects such as hypotension and foetal heart rate abnormalities occur 
more quickly and are more pronounced. Different techniques for administering low-concentration, high-volume local anaesthetic–opioid regimens allow maintenance of epidural analgesia through the epidural

catheter. Whenever an epidural catheter is in situ in a high-risk woman, 
higher doses can be administered for conversion to caesarean section, 
avoiding airway and other complications of general anaesthesia. In women 
at risk of dural ectasia, including Marfan syndrome, extra caution and management in an expert centre is essential. Furthermore, a pre-delivery consultation with the anaesthesia team is needed.167 When neuraxial analgesia 
is contraindicated due to conditions such as systemic anticoagulation or 
spinal deformities, opioids (i.v. remifentanil) are an alternative despite 
the risk of hypoventilation and apnoea.168,169 Single-shot spinal analgesia 
is common in caesarean delivery for its simplicity and effectiveness.167 
4.5.6. Delivery in women on anticoagulants 
4.5.6.1. Planned delivery 
In women with mechanical heart valves (MHVs) taking VKAs, suspension of VKAs and bridging with heparin [either therapeutic-dose 
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or i.v. unfractionated heparin 
(UFH)] is recommended at least 2 weeks before planned delivery 
(see also Section 5 and Section 12). This is because of the slow metabolism of VKA in the foetus. If therapeutic-dose LMWH is used, one 
strategy is to switch to i.v. therapeutic UFH at least 36 h before planned 
delivery.170 In these settings the target activated partial thromboplastin 
time (aPTT) is ≥2 times control values. UFH can then be stopped 4–6 h 
before surgery (in case of caesarean section) or before insertion of regional anaesthesia or anticipated vaginal delivery. For women who are 
on therapeutic-dose LMWH for non-MHV indications, dosing can be 
omitted for 24 h prior to caesarean section or anticipated vaginal delivery with no need for bridging. In women with MHVs who are on 
LMWH and aspirin in combination, consideration should be given to 
stopping aspirin 4 days before delivery.170 
4.5.6.2. Urgent delivery on therapeutic anticoagulation 
Managing women who are anticoagulated during delivery is complex 
and needs an individualized approach. Figure 5 gives an overview, but 
again each scenario may need a more tailored solution. 
4.5.6.2.1. Delivery on vitamin K antagonists. If women require urgent delivery and have been taking VKAs within the last 2 weeks, 
then delivery by caesarean section is recommended to reduce the 
risk of foetal intracranial bleeding. When urgent delivery is required, 
preventing bleeding complications with administration of i.v. four-factor 
prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC), depending on the international normalized ratio (INR) (25 U/kg for a therapeutic INR range of 
2–4) is the preferred method for rapid INR normalization. If necessary, 
vitamin K should be given.171,172 If 4F-PCC is not available, fresh frozen 
plasma (FFP) is an alternative, but it takes longer to reverse an elevated 
INR and requires a larger fluid challenge.171,173. The involvement of an 
expert haematologist in these scenarios is essential, in addition to the 
Pregnancy Heart Team. The foetus may remain anticoagulated for 8– 
10 days after discontinuation of maternal VKAs, and may need to be given FFP and higher doses of vitamin K.170 
4.5.6.2.2. Delivery on heparin. If delivery occurs after recent administration of heparin (e.g. within 4–6 h of UFH, with non-normalized aPTT, 
or within 12 h of therapeutic LMWH) protamine sulfate should be given. 
Neutralization of LMWH varies between products and may be less effective.174 Protamine dosage depends on timing after the last dose of 
LMWH (1 mg/1 mg enoxaparin <8 h; 0.5 mg/1 mg enoxaparin >8 h). 
For UFH, 1 mg of protamine per 100 units of heparin is needed.175 
In addition to the level of anticoagulation, the decision to reverse anticoagulation should also be related to the bleeding risk, which is higher 
with conditions such as placental abruption, placenta previa, and multiple previous caesarean sections. 
4.5.6.3. Restarting anticoagulation after delivery 
The decision to restart anticoagulation post-delivery is challenging and 
must balance risk of bleeding and risk of thrombosis. Anaesthetic, cardiac, 
haematology, and obstetric teams may have different priorities, but all 
need to be actively involved in decision-making, which should also involve 
the patient. Late obstetric bleeding (>24 h) is common,176 as was also 
confirmed in recent data from the ROPAC III trial177 (bleeding on 
mean post-partum day 3.6), suggesting that these events occur at a 
time when heparin is being used at the same time as the VKA is being reintroduced. Restarting UFH (aPTT levels ≥2 times the control) or low/ 
intermediate doses of LMWH are all valid options.170 Techniques to reduce bleeding risk include active management of the third stage of labour 
with oxytocin. Recently, the effect of adding 2 IU oxytocin over 10 min to 
a standard treatment of low-dose infusion for 4 h [10 IU of oxytocin in 
500 mL of normal saline given i.v. at 36 mL/h for 4 h (12 mU/min)] was 
analysed. The addition of 2 IU of oxytocin was not associated with any 
greater derangement in cardiovascular measures, but with a significantly 
lower volume of blood loss.158 VKA should only be started 7–14 days 
or later post-partum to reduce the risk of late bleeding.170 
4.5.7. Endocarditis prophylaxis for delivery 
Systemic antibiotics according to the 2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of endocarditis may be considered for delivery in women at 
high risk of endocarditis.178

4.6. Post-partum monitoring and 
complications 
4.6.1. Monitoring 
The post-partum period is associated with significant haemodynamic 
changes and fluid shifts. Hence, women are at risk of adverse outcomes, 
such as hypertension, HF, or stroke.181,182 Post-partum management 
must be individualized and depends on the woman’s underlying CVD, 
risk or presence of arrhythmias and HF symptoms, and the course during pregnancy and delivery. For women at the highest HF risk or with 
HF symptoms during pregnancy or delivery, admission to an intensive 
(cardiac) care unit during the first 24–48 h for haemodynamic monitoring should be considered.183 Early ambulation is important to reduce 
the thromboembolism risk. 
In women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, blood pressure 
should be monitored in hospital (or with an equivalent level of outpatient surveillance) for 72 h after birth and checked again 7–10 days 
post-partum. Optimizing blood pressure levels from the immediate 
post-partum period until the first post-natal months could help prevent 
the development of hypertension and improve long-term cardiovascular health.184 
4.6.2. Breastfeeding and lactation 
Throughout these Guidelines, the term ‘lactation’ (including not only 
breastfeeding but also other methods such as pumping) is used as the 
default term in most sections, especially where it encompasses a broader scope, such as in medication-related contexts. We use ‘breastfeeding’ specifically in sections where the focus is on the act of nursing or 
direct feeding at the breast, particularly when discussing its physiological 
and long-term health outcomes. 
Breastfeeding is a global priority because interruption of lactation is 
associated with adverse health outcomes for the woman and her child, 
including higher maternal risks of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, and hypertension, and greater infant risks of infectious and metabolic disease.185,186 
Inhibition of lactation can be obtained with standard doses of cabergoline in general, or bromocriptine in peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). 
Several drugs are contraindicated during lactation (see Figure 6 in 
Section 5 and Supplementary data online, Table S4). 
4.6.3. Complications 
4.6.3.1. Haemorrhage 
Post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) is more frequently reported in women with CVD.187 To reduce the risk of PPH, an active third stage of 
labour with early cord clamping and administration of oxytocin to deliver the placenta should be pursued. Maternal anaemia is a known risk 
factor for PPH, so anaemia should be managed aggressively in the antenatal period. 
At the time of delivery, a slow i.v. infusion of 2 IU oxytocin over 10 
min immediately after birth, followed by 12 mU/min for 4 h, reduces 
the PPH risk and has a minimal impact on cardiovascular parameters.158 
In cases of PPH that are refractory to medical treatment, additional devices may be used, such as the Bakri intrauterine balloon, uterine compression sutures, or further haemostatic measures including uterine 
artery embolization or hysterectomy. 
4.6.3.2. Psychological reactions, post-partum depression 
Although the general risk of post-partum depression among new 
mothers in the general population is ∼10%–20%, this risk increases 
with underlying health conditions such as CVD, where ∼1 in 
3 mothers have reported symptoms of depression in the post- 
partum period.188 Those with PPCM are particularly vulnerable to 
depression.189–191 These findings emphasize the critical need for 
early detection, regular mental health screening and the necessity 
of holistic care models with psychological support and tailored 
interventions.191,192 
5. Drugs during pregnancy and 
lactation 
5.1. General principles 
5.1.1. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in 
pregnancy 
Physiological adaptation of maternal organ systems to pregnancy 
affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of potentially 
all medical treatments, including cardiovascular drugs (see Section  
3.2).146,193,194 
5.1.2. Pharmacogenetics 
An overlap between individual genotypes associated with drug effects 
and pregnancy-induced modifications (e.g. liver enzymes) may unmask 
adverse effects or require careful titration, in particular for drugs that 
lead to severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). As an example, warfarin can cause severe ADR at the maternal (bleeding, thrombosis) 
and/or foetal level (embryotoxicity, teratogenesis).195 The most notable cases refer to the polymorphisms of CYP2D6, associated with different phenotypes (extensive, ultrarapid, or poor metabolizers), 
leading to diverse pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of drugs 
used in pregnancy such as beta-blockers (e.g. labetalol, metoprolol), 
antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine), and analgesic drugs 
(e.g. tramadol, codeine).194 Poor and ultrarapid metabolizers may experience extreme variations in drug plasma level and bioavailability, 
and hence in their effects.195 
5.1.3. Newborn drug exposure in breast milk 
The exposure of the newborn to maternal drugs via breast milk is expressed as a percentage value, calculated as the dose taken by the infant compared either to the therapeutic dose of the same drug (often 
unknown for newborns) or the maternal weight-adjusted dose.196 
The ‘relative infant dose’ (RID) depends on the relative amount of 
drug secreted in the milk (milk-to-plasma concentration ratio) and 
the quantity of milk intake (the standard is 150 mL/kg/day) on a 
body weight basis.196 The dose per kg of the infant is compared to 
the maternal dose per kg over the same period. A RID lower than 
5%–10% is generally considered safe (see Figure 6; Supplementary 
data online; Table S4; and LactMed database).197 
5.2. Drug classes in pregnancy 
5.2.1. Anticoagulants 
The use of anticoagulants during pregnancy represents a complex 
balance of risks and benefits, influenced by specific indications, 
and hampered by low-quality evidence. Indications for anticoagulation in pregnancy are diverse and covered in different sections in 
these Guidelines. In this section, we cover drug-specific aspects 
and dosing regimens that explicitly pertain to the setting of 
pregnancy.

Low-molecular-weight heparin treatment regimen glossary 
To ensure consistency throughout these Guidelines, we apply the following wording about LMWH treatment—any deviations from these 
standards are clearly indicated in the specific sections: 
• Prophylactic-dose LMWH refers to low fixed doses with adjustment 
for extremes of body weight.198 
• Therapeutic-dose LMWH refers to high doses typically reserved for 
treatment of VTE (Section 11) and thrombosis prevention in 
MHVs (Section 12).  
An individualized shared decision-making approach with careful consideration of maternal thrombosis risk vs foetopathy is needed, and 
strategies will vary from prophylactic dosing of LMWH to correctly 
dosed VKAs. Regional differences, also related to lower availability of 
anti-factor Xa level monitoring in low- and middle-income countries 
as indicated by the ROPAC III study, also need to be taken into account. 
Interestingly, this study shows that despite higher monitoring and better resource availability, the risk of thrombosis was higher in high- 
income countries, specifically due to higher use of treatment regimens 
with therapeutic LMWH.177 Haemorrhagic complications in the 
mother can occur with all regimens.199 Table 10 lists the regimens 
and disease entities in which anticoagulants are indicated. 
5.2.1.1. Vitamin K antagonists 
Vitamin K antagonists cross the placenta and are associated with embryopathy and foetopathy risk, even at low doses. They will therefore 
be switched to LMWHs in most pregnant women, with the only exception being women with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the context of moderate to severe mitral valve stenosis or MHVs, given the lower thrombosis 
risk with VKAs compared to LMWH in the latter (see Section 12).179,200 
Women receiving chronic VKAs who are contemplating pregnancy 
need counselling regarding avoidance of the potential teratogenic effects. When switching (usually to LMWH) is desired, this should take 
place as soon after conception as possible. 
Vitamin K antagonist embryopathy is thought to be related to interference with embryonic ossification.201,202 Adverse impact is highest in 
the first trimester (0.6%–12% of embryopathy) and much lower but 
persisting in later stages of pregnancy (0.7%–2% risk of foetopathy, 
e.g. central nervous anomalies, intracranial haemorrhage).200,203,204 
The risk of embryopathy in the first trimester depends on the VKA 
dose. The risk was 0.45%–0.9% in pregnancies with low-dose warfarin 
according to two systematic reviews.199,205 In this setting, low-dose refers to the dose necessary to maintain the appropriate INR (according 
to current guidelines this equals doses of ≤5 mg of warfarin, ≤2 mg/day 
acenocoumarol, ≤3 mg/day phenprocoumon).43 This approach may be 
seen as a reasonable balance between the risks to the mother with

MHV and the foetus.170,200,204,206,207 Due to incomplete development 
of liver metabolism, the INR takes longer to normalize in the foetus and 
neonate than in the mother, which is why VKA should be discontinued 
2 weeks before delivery (see Section 4). 
If the indication of anticoagulation is non-MHV, such as 
pregnancy-related VTE, VKAs are not recommended. In case of pre- 
existing VKA or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy due to previous VTE, VKAs and DOACs should be replaced by LMWH when 
pregnancy is planned or at recognition of pregnancy.208 
Vitamin K antagonists are safe during lactation209 and are recommended in all women with MHVs given their superior anticoagulant 
properties in avoiding valve thrombosis.179,200 
5.2.1.2. Low-molecular-weight heparins 
Embryopathy or foetopathy has not been reported with LMWHs, even 
in therapeutic doses, but thromboembolic complications in women 
with MHVs are higher than with VKAs (8.7%, 5.8%, and 2.7% for 
LMWH, UFH, and VKA, respectively).179,200 LMWHs appear less likely 
to induce heparin-induced thrombocytopenia compared with UFH, although this has not been studied in pregnancy.210 
Data on optimal dosing and frequency of administration in pregnancy 
are scarce and mostly limited to the setting of VTE and MHV. 
5.2.1.2.1. Low-molecular-weight heparin dosing. In women with 
MHVs, slightly higher starting doses are suggested to ensure minimal 
delay in reaching the target range (See Table 11).176 
For prophylactic-dose LMWH, a fixed low-dose LMWH regimen can 
be used in most cases.207 In women with acute VTE requiring therapeutic LMWH dose, routine anti-factor Xa monitoring has not been 
shown to affect clinical outcomes despite fluctuations of anti-factor 
Xa levels during pregnancy, and should only be considered in women 
with renal insufficiency or obesity, where adjustment for body weight 
may result in overdosing.211–213 Underweight patients show a low 
prevalence of antepartum or post-partum VTE214 and do not require 
specific recommendations compared to patients with normal 
weight.215 
Monitoring of anti-factor Xa levels is essential in women with MHVs 
on therapeutic-dose LMWH: at least weekly until target level is 
achieved or when there is a below target level at any stage, and regular 
monitoring thereafter (e.g. every 2–4 weeks depending on stability) 
(see Section 12.5.3.2). Recommended peak anti-factor Xa levels should 
be individualized based on type and location of the valve (between 1.0 
and 1.2 U/mL) and additional trough level measurement may be indicated in selected cases with increased thrombosis risk (see Section  
12.5.3.2).216 
5.2.1.2.2. Once-daily vs twice-daily administration. In pregnant women with confirmed acute VTE, no clear benefit of a twice-daily 
LMWH administration vs a once-daily administration has been demonstrated.217,218 Thus, either using a once- or twice-daily regimen, each 
one resulting in a therapeutic dose, is reasonable. 
Twice-daily administration at slightly higher doses is the usual therapeutic dosing regimen for pregnant women with MHVs.177 There is insufficient evidence for the use of LMWH injections more frequently 
than twice daily. 
5.2.1.3. Unfractionated heparin 
Intravenous UFH, although not crossing the placenta, is associated with 
higher risks of thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis compared with 
LMWH. The risk of valve thrombosis during pregnancy with subcutaneous UFH is unacceptably high and its use is not recommended.219 
In women with MHVs in whom VKAs cannot be continued, intravenous UFH is only indicated when anti-factor Xa monitoring is not possible during the first trimester and at the time of delivery (see Section  
4.5.6). However, intravenous heparin dosing is challenging, requiring 
hospitalization and multiple daily blood tests to achieve an aPTT ≥2 
times control values. 
5.2.1.4. Fondaparinux 
In women requiring prophylaxis of VTE, good outcomes with subcutaneous fondaparinux were reported in an observational study of 65 
pregnancies and a retrospective analysis in 84 women with one or 
more previous pregnancies.220,221 Its use can be considered if there is 
an allergy or adverse response to LMWH (prophylactic dose: 2.5 mg 
daily; therapeutic dose: up to 10 mg daily)221–223 (see Section 11). 
5.2.1.5. Direct oral anticoagulants 
Direct oral anticoagulants have shown better bleeding profiles than a 
LMWH or VKA regimen across diverse indications in non-pregnant populations. Outcome data on their use in pregnancy are scarce and inconsistently captured in pharmacovigilance databases, indicating a 
need for a more robust system of reporting.224,225 The foetal effects 
of DOACs are controversial.226,227 Animal and in vitro studies showed 
that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban crossed the placenta.228–230 
Prescription information based on these data reported variable adverse 
effects in pregnant rodents and rabbits: post-implantation loss, maternal bleeding, or malformation at >4 times the recommended maternal 
doses (see Supplementary data online, Table S4). Counselling women 
on DOACs who are planning a pregnancy is advised, considering the 
complexity of pre- and post-conceptional switches to alternative

regimens (LMWH, VKA) and the risk of VTE recurrence.227 DOACs 
may have an edge over VKAs, such as rapid reversal in case of premature delivery and a short antepartum interruption period, due to their 
reversible inhibition of procoagulant factors. The oral route is an advantage over LMWHs. However, evidence of safety is lacking for specific 
DOAC antidotes (andexanet alfa, idarucizumab) in pregnant women 
and can only be inferred from pre-clinical studies. After uncertain initial 
reports on foetotoxicity,224 a recent retrospective cohort study (mainly in women exposed to rivaroxaban) does not support a high risk of 
embryotoxicity.231 It should be highlighted that despite promising studies, clinical evidence on the benefits and risks of DOACs for the mother 
and foetus is scarce and needed, and their foetal safety over VKAs during the second and third trimesters has not been established. DOACs 
are not recommended in pregnancy and they should only be used in the 
absence of any other option in consultation with the Pregnancy Heart 
Team and the haematology team. Based on current data there is no absolute indication to interrupt pregnancy in the case of accidental 
exposure.227,232 
During lactation, alternative drugs should be preferred to DOACs 
due to the paucity of data. However, there are relevant differences between the agents. In studies on lactating women treated with apixaban, 
the concentration in milk was significantly higher than that of rivaroxaban: the milk-to-plasma ratio was >12%,233 and the weight-adjusted infant doses 14%–20%.234 Dabigatran etexilate mesylate, the orally 
available prodrug, is poorly excreted to the milk after biotransformation to dabigatran, and its oral absorption by the neonatal gastrointestinal tract is likely negligible. In two breastfed neonates of women 
receiving dabigatran, the maximum drug concentrations in the neonates’ plasma were 100 000 times below the levels that would have a 
significant effect on coagulation indices.235 In lactating women treated 
with 15–20 mg/day rivaroxaban, the breastfed infant would receive a 
low dose, corresponding to 1.3%–5% of the maternal weight-adjusted 
dosage.233,236–238 Therefore, dabigatran and rivaroxaban may be taken 
cautiously during lactation. Signs of bleeding should be monitored in 
neonates of lactating mothers taking dabigatran. 
5.2.2. Antiplatelet treatment 
No teratogenic effect is reported for aspirin doses up to 300 mg daily. 
Clopidogrel is considered safe if dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is 
needed for the shortest possible duration.239,240 Ticagrelor is contraindicated due to embryotoxicity. Prasugrel may be considered during 
pregnancy in special populations including poor metabolizers in 
whom the prodrug clopidogrel has limited effect.241,242 The use of 
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (eptifibatide and tirofiban) should only 
be used in pregnancy if strictly necessary.240 
5.2.3. Diuretics and SGLT2 inhibitors 
Diuretics may be used in pregnancy to treat systemic hypertension especially in emergencies or HF-related volume overload conditions. 
Care must be taken to monitor for reduction in plasma volume or 
CO, and decrease in placental perfusion. 
Pre-clinical data on SGLT2 inhibitors showed that they cross the placenta243 and exposure to these drugs may cause foetal damage in rodents, especially during the second and third trimesters.244 SGLT2 
inhibitors should be stopped before pregnancy and during lactation. 
5.2.4. Pulmonary hypertension 
Parenteral prostaglandin analogues (i.v. epoprostenol, treprostinil) can 
be used in pregnant women with significant right ventricle (RV) dysfunction, while recognizing that these agents may interfere with platelet aggregation and may promote bleeding.245 Oral phosphodiesterase 5 
inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil) can also be used, while recognizing 
the potential side effects of pre-term delivery and SGA babies.246 
Combination therapy with sildenafil and inhaled iloprost has also 
been reported.247 Calcium channel blockers should be continued during pregnancy for women with vasodilator-responsive PAH and normal 
RV function. Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs, e.g. bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan) should not be used in pregnancy due to their 
teratogenic potential. There are few data on the safety of agents 
such as bosentan and sildenafil in the post-partum period for lactating 
mothers; however, successful cases have been reported.248,249 
5.2.5. Anti-arrhythmic agents 
For women without structural heart disease, anti-arrhythmic drugs (such 
as flecainide, sotalol, and ibutilide) can be used for the prevention or termination of AF and atrial flutter (AFL).250,251 Beta-blockers are considered safe, especially lipophilic compounds (labetalol, metoprolol, and 
propranolol). In pregnant women with AF and concomitant congestive 
HF, digoxin may be an alternative option for rate control. Amiodarone 
can cause foetal abnormalities, bradycardia, and thyroid dysfunction, 
and its routine use is contraindicated during pregnancy, but may be 
used as single dose in emergencies like ventricular tachycardia (VT) 
storm. There are no restrictions on amiodarone use in cardiac arrest.252 
5.2.6. Calcium channel blockers 
The safety and efficacy of nifedipine [the originator of dihydropyridine 
calcium channel blockers (CCBs)] as an antihypertensive in pregnancy 
has largely been proved in comparison with other antihypertensive 
treatments (see Section 12.3). A meta-analysis of 22 randomized control trials with 2595 participants found that nifedipine was significantly 
more effective at reducing patients’ high blood pressure compared 
with other antihypertensive drugs (labetalol, hydralazine, methyldopa) 
in hypertensive patients.253 Foetal, neonatal, and maternal safety 
outcomes were not statistically different between nifedipine and comparators, except for maternal headache and flushing.253 A randomized 
controlled trial compared oral regimens with nifedipine, labetalol, 
or methyldopa in women requiring antihypertensive therapy due to 
severe hypertension. It found that the primary outcome of blood pressure control within 6 h with no adverse outcome was more common 
with nifedipine or labetalol than with methyldopa254. Amlodipine 
showed safety and efficacy similar to nifedipine.255 Studies on the non- 
dihydropyridine CCB diltiazem are inadequate and significant potential 
teratogenic effects have been demonstrated in rodents and rabbits. 
The drug passes in milk, reaching relevant infant concentrations. 
Therefore, diltiazem is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. 
Oral verapamil is considered safe; no teratogenicity has been observed. 
The drug is excreted at low levels in milk, <1% of the mother’s weight- 
adjusted dosage.

5.2.7. Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system 
inhibitors 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors 
(ARNIs), and renin inhibitors can cause foetal malformations, 
IUGR and death, and are contraindicated in pregnancy. Caution 
should be recommended to childbearing women, especially in the 
absence of effective contraception. Captopril, enalapril, and benazepril are safe during lactation,146 whereas ARBs are not recommended. Candesartan may be an exception.256 Aldosterone 
antagonists, canrenone, and spironolactone can have anti- 
androgenetic effects and are contraindicated in pregnancy. 
Spironolactone is considered safe during lactation because of extensive metabolism to canrenone, thus the infant would receive less 
than 1% of the mother’s daily dosage of canrenone.257 Case reports 
of eplerenone in pregnant women with resistant hypertension identified no adverse effects.258–261 
5.2.8. Lipid-lowering agents 
Diagnosis of maternal hypercholesterolaemia at the first trimester or 
familial hypercholesterolaemia have adverse consequences for both 
foetus and mother.262 Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels increase 
by ∼30%–50%, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 20%–40%, 
and triglycerides by 50%–100% during pregnancy262, so referring 
to reference range as for routine testing is of limited clinical use. 
Previously, lipid-lowering treatment was usually discontinued during 
pregnancy because of limited safety data.43 Having been contraindicated in pregnancy since 1987, statins now remain contraindicated 
only during lactation. In July 2021 the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA)263 stated that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that a risk of miscarriage is increased with statins 
and requested removal of the contraindication.264 Continuing 
with statins may therefore be considered during pregnancy in women with familial hypercholesterolaemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (see Section 12.2).265 
Furthermore, inadvertent conception during statin therapy does 
not require pregnancy termination but should prompt close follow- 
up. Bile acid binding sequestrants265 and LDL apheresis265 can be 
considered in women with familial hypercholesterolaemia. PCSK9 
inhibitors and ezetimibe are not recommended during pregnancy 
due to lack of clinical data.266 Bempedoic acid has a strong contraindication and therefore women are recommended contraception 
during its use. 
5.2.9. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents 
Beta-blocker use during early pregnancy has not been associated with 
an increased risk of congenital malformations.250,267,268 Recent data 
from ROPAC indicate higher SGA rates in women with beta-blocker 
exposure (15.3% vs 9.3%, P < .001). With metoprolol as reference, labetalol (0.2, 95% CI 0.1–0.4) was the least likely to cause SGA, and 
atenolol (2.3, 95% CI 1.1–4.9) the most.12 Labetalol and lipophilic 
drugs (metoprolol, propranolol, carvedilol) are preferred due to 
high first-pass metabolism, as well as beta-1-selective drugs (bisoprolol, metoprolol), which reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia in addition to 
reduced IUGR. Nadolol and pindolol are also safe in the case of arrhythmic events in cardiomyopathies and channelopathies (see 
Section 6).269–271 Of note, the metabolism of metoprolol (and perhaps 
other oral lipophilic beta-blockers) was significantly higher in mid and 
late pregnancy than post-partum, likely due to enzymatic induction 
during pregnancy.272 Changes in dosage (dose and frequency) are likely required if inadequate clinical responses are encountered.272 
Atenolol causes severe growth restriction, bradycardia, and hypoglycaemia and is not recommended.250,268,272,273 
Propranolol, metoprolol (combined with hydralazine), and labetalol 
had the lowest and sotalol the highest risk of neonatal bradycardia during lactation.274 For the lipophilic beta-blockers, milk level was <1% of 
the maternal weight-adjusted dose, thus reducing the risks associated 
with neonatal exposure during lactation.272 
5.2.10. Immunosuppressants 
The balance between maternal and foetal safety is challenging for immunosuppressant therapy, especially for women with heart transplantation. Medication can pass to the milk and expose neonates 
and infants to adverse drug effects. Changes in maternal physiology 
impact the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressant drugs (see 
Section 3.2).275 Calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus), 
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (e.g. everolimus, sirolimus), 
and azathioprine are the drugs of choice during pregnancy and lactation, which should not be discouraged. Mycophenolate derivatives increase the risk of miscarriage and foetal malformations especially 
during the first trimester and should be discontinued at least 6 weeks 
before conception.276,277 
5.2.11. Neuroactive drugs 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including sertraline, can be taken safely during pregnancy and lactation.278 Zuranolone, a synthetic 
form of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, has recently been approved for the treatment of post-partum depression. No information 
is available on its safety in patients with CVD. Zuranolone is excreted in 
the milk and lactation should be avoided in the absence of safety 
data.279 
5.2.12. Obstetric drugs in patients with 
cardiovascular disease 
Drugs for inducing ovulation, including follicle-stimulating hormone and 
luteinizing hormone or combinations, are associated with an increased 
risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE, due to the sharp rise in oestrogen levels during follicle recruitment,280 but no other immediate cardiovascular side effects are known.

### 6 Pregnancy in women with

cardiomyopathies and primary 
arrhythmia syndromes 
6.1. Cardiomyopathies 
Cardiomyopathies are characterized by disease-specific structural abnormalities and increased risk of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. The risk associated with pregnancy in a woman with 
cardiomyopathy can be estimated using the mWHO 2.0 classification 
(Table 6). Pre-pregnancy, women with cardiomyopathies should be 
clinically evaluated to optimize treatment, avoid contraindicated drugs, 
and assess the risk of heart failure and arrhythmias. Indicated procedures, including implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation, should be performed before pregnancy. 60 
Genetic counselling is recommended before pregnancy to explain 
the probability of genetic transmission, risks for the mother, foetus, 
and child, and the possibilities of pre-implantation and pre-natal genetic 
testing (Table 7).60,281 Women with cardiomyopathies should be managed by the Pregnancy Heart Team, including a cardiologist with expertise in cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias. 
6.1.1. Dilated cardiomyopathy and non-dilated left 
ventricular cardiomyopathy 
In women with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and non-dilated left ventricle (LV) cardiomyopathy (NDLVC), severe systolic LV dysfunction, 
New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV, RV failure, 
sustained ventricular arrhythmias, AF, and/or severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) are high-risk criteria for major adverse cardiovascular events 
during pregnancy.282 In contrast, women with mild LV dysfunction, good 
functional status, no arrhythmias, and no history of cardiac events are 
likely to have an uncomplicated pregnancy.282 
Therapy should be modified before pregnancy. ACE-Is, ARBs, 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), sacubitril/valsartan, and 
SGLT2 inhibitors are all contraindicated during pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy 
risk stratification should include temporary withdrawal of contraindicated 
medication with close monitoring (see Section 12.6 Heart failure). 
Beta-blockers should be continued with close monitoring of foetal growth. 
If anticoagulation is needed for AF or evidence of an intracardiac thrombus, 
LMWH should be used (see Section 5 for dosing regimens). 
Data about genotype-specific management during pregnancy are 
scarce but one study evaluated the risk of pregnancy and progression 
of cardiomyopathy in women with lamin A/C (LMNA) P/LP variants.283 
A small subset of women experienced arrhythmias during pregnancy although a history of pregnancy was not associated with long-term adverse disease progression.283 
More information is included in Sections 7, 12.4, and 12.6. 
6.1.2. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular 
cardiomyopathy 
Several observational studies and registries have shown that pregnancies in women with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy 
(ARVC) are generally well tolerated with good foetal outcomes and 
no cardiac mortality when receiving optimal surveillance and therapy.284,285 Delivery was usually vaginal and appeared safe. Sustained 
ventricular arrhythmias were reported in 5% of pregnancies and HF 
in 13%. Neither increased arrhythmia burden or ICD shocks were observed.284 Beta-blocker therapy should be continued during pregnancy 
(with the exception of atenolol) or could be started in pregnancy if 
needed. The two most used anti-arrhythmic drugs in previous studies, 
beside beta-blockers, were flecainide and sotalol. Both drugs have a 
long record of safety. However, sotalol should be used with caution 
in women with reduced ejection fraction (EF) and with careful corrected QT interval (QTc) monitoring.60 Sotalol also has a beta-blocker 
effect, necessitating monitoring of foetal growth.286,287 Amiodarone is 
contraindicated in pregnancy. In women at high arrhythmic risk, an ICD 
should be implanted, preferably before pregnancy (see Section 12.4). 
Two large studies of women with ARVC showed that pre-pregnancy 
phenotypical severity, rather than pregnancy itself, was the primary risk 
factor. Pregnancy was uneventful in the overwhelming majority.288,289 
Pregnancy did not seem to accelerate long-term progression of the 
ARVC phenotype.288 
6.1.3. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy290 is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy and is often caused by variants in sarcomeric genes.60 Phenocopies 
such as Anderson–Fabry disease and Danon disease290 are X-linked and 
therefore the cardiac phenotype tends to be milder and occurs later in 
life in females than males, making pregnancy usually uneventful.291–293 
Despite higher maternal mortality in women with HCM compared 
with the general population, absolute maternal mortality is low (0.5%) 
and confined to women at particularly high risk (Table 6).294,295 Data 
from the ROPAC registry showed that despite overall good outcomes, 
23% of pregnant women with HCM developed major cardiac events, including VT (10%) and AF (1.7%), mostly in women already identified as 
high risk prior to pregnancy.296 A recent systematic review including 
1624 women confirmed low neonatal mortality (0.2%) and stillbirths 
(1%) in pregnant women with HCM.297 A study including 242 women 
with HCM found that pregnancy was not a modifier of the long-term 
outcomes and pregnancy was well tolerated.298 Risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events were advanced NYHA class and 
higher age at diagnosis.298 Left atrium diameter as a risk factor has 
been reported with conflicting results.298,299 
6.1.3.1. Treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in pregnancy 
Ongoing beta-blocker therapy should be continued during pregnancy. 
Atenolol should be replaced before pregnancy (Section 5.2.6). Atrial fibrillation is poorly tolerated in HCM patients in general due to the risk of 
haemodynamic decompensation, and medical or electrical cardioversion of AF during pregnancy should be considered. Beta-blockers 
should be started during pregnancy when new symptoms occur [e.g. 
due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO)], for rate 
control in AF, and to suppress ventricular arrhythmias. Verapamil is 
the second choice of drug when beta-blockers are not tolerated. 
6.1.3.2. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction 
Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients may increase slightly 
during pregnancy and were previously associated with increased cardiac events including arrhythmias and HF.300 However, subsequent 
studies have not confirmed this association.296,298 
In women with obstructive HCM, it is recommended to evaluate gradient in basal condition, with exercise and the Valsalva manoeuvre, before pregnancy and with only the medications allowed during 
pregnancy, to identify those needing septal reduction therapy before 
pregnancy.60 Disopyramide may cause uterine contractions and is not 
recommended in pregnancy and should be discontinued unless the benefits outweigh foetal risk. Data on the safety of alcohol septal ablation 
during pregnancy are limited to a few case reports.60,301,302

Myosin inhibitors (e.g. mavacamten) have not been tested in pregnancy and animal studies have shown foetal toxicity.303 Therefore, 
contraception is recommended while on this treatment. Mavacamten 
may interact with hormonal contraception and therefore adding intrauterine or barrier contraception to hormonal contraception may be 
considered. Myosin inhibitor treatment should be discontinued at least 
6 months before planning pregnancy304 (see Supplementary data 
online, Table S4). 
6.1.4. Hypertrabeculation of the left ventricle 
Hypertrabeculation in isolation identified during pregnancy can be the 
simple consequence of an increased preload, can resolve after pregnancy, and cannot be used to make a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy.60 
Patients with hypertrabeculation and associated HCM, DCM, or 
NDLVC should follow the same recommendation as patients with 
the specific cardiomyopathy.60 
6.1.5. Labour and delivery in cardiomyopathies 
Labour and delivery may be associated with acute pain, adrenaline release, and need for urgent administration of anaesthetic drugs, and 
therefore haemodynamic monitoring and continuous telemetry monitoring during and after delivery is often warranted. In the absence of obstetric contraindications, vaginal delivery is generally recommended. 
Neuraxial anaesthesia reduces pain and therefore reduces adrenergic 
activation and arrhythmic risk. 
In HCM, peripheral vasodilatation is poorly tolerated in women 
with severe LVOT obstruction (LVOTO) and therefore epidural 
and spinal anaesthesia should be applied cautiously. Low-risk 
LVOTO cases may have a spontaneous labour and vaginal delivery. 
Caesarean section may be the preferred option in women with severe 
LVOTO. 
6.2. Primary arrhythmia syndromes 
In general, women with primary arrhythmia syndromes tolerate pregnancy well. Genetic counselling is recommended before pregnancy, 
as discussed in Section 6.1. A complete clinical re-evaluation, optimization of treatment, and ICD evaluation should be undertaken prior to 
pregnancy.252 Indicated treatment should be continued throughout 
pregnancy and in the post-partum period. 
6.2.1. Long QT syndrome 
Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is the most common channelopathy.307 All patients with LQTS should take beta-blockers, with propranolol and nadolol 
being the most effective.308 Additional therapies include left cardiac sympathetic denervation309 and mexiletine for LQT3252 and LQT2.310,311 The 
foetal risk of mexiletine treatment is unknown, and decisions on treatment 
during pregnancy should be a shared decision with the woman. 
Retrospective studies312–316 show that women with LQTS were not at 
higher risk of cardiac events during pregnancy itself, but had an increased risk

in the post-partum period (up to 12 months), especially for those with 
LQT2. Beta-blocker therapy was associated with risk reduction in all the 
studies. Women with LQTS should therefore start beta-blockers at pregnancy or continue beta-blockers at pre-pregnancy dose, with propranolol 
or nadolol as drugs of choice. Beta-blockers should be continued in the post- 
partum period, particularly in the case of women with LQT2 due to the increased arrhythmic risk. It should be noted that nadolol has a higher excretion in breast milk than propranolol, with a relative infant dose of 4%–7%.317 
Therefore, nadolol is generally not the preferred beta-blocker during lactation. However, arrhythmic risk can be high in LQTS, and nadolol is one of the 
drugs of choice; thereofore, a careful weighting of benefit against harm is appropriate. Change of beta-blocker therapy after delivery should be avoided, 
as this is a vulnerable phase. Therefore, a change from nadolol to propranolol should ideally be evaluated before pregnancy. High dosages of nadolol 
during lactation may require monitoring of the infant for bradycardia. 
Women with LQTS should always avoid QT-prolonging drugs (see  
www.crediblemeds.org)318. Women with LQTS should be promptly 
treated for hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia, which is relevant in 
pregnancy-related hyperemesis, causing electrolyte disturbances and 
failure to absorb oral medications. All anti-emetic medications are 
QT-prolonging. Electrocardiogram monitoring should be performed 
if anti-emetic therapy is absolutely required. 
Long QT syndrome can manifest very early in life, even during the foetal period, and can be a cause of stillbirth319,320 (Section 4.5.1). A neonatal 
ECG should be performed post-delivery and after 2 weeks to avoid overdiagnosis due to transiently prolonged QT interval during the first 7–10 
days of life.321 Genetic screening for familiar genetic variants should be 
performed as soon as possible (e.g. from chordal blood). If the newborn 
is affected by LQTS, beta-blocker therapy should be started immediately. 
6.2.2. Brugada syndrome 
Men with Brugada syndrome (BrS) are more often symptomatic than 
women.322 The only retrospective study on pregnant women with 
BrS did not show an increased risk of cardiac events during pregnancy 
and the post-partum period.323 All patients with BrS should avoid contraindicated drugs (see www.brugadadrugs.org),324 large meals, or excess alcohol, and promptly treat fever and its causes.325 If there are 
symptoms during pregnancy, quinidine therapy should be considered 
with monitoring of hepatic function and blood count in the mother. 
6.2.3. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular  
tachycardia 
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is 
mainly caused by P/LP in the RYR2 gene.252 The only retrospective 
study published, involving 96 women and 228 pregnancies, did not 
show an increased risk of cardiac events during pregnancy and the post- 
partum period.326 
Beta-blockers are the mainstay of therapy, with additive flecainide if 
needed.322,327 Nadolol and propranolol are beta-blockers of choice and 
should be continued during pregnancy and lactation. As in LQTS, the 
higher excretion of nadolol in breast milk should be noted (Section  
6.2.1). Left cardiac sympathetic denervation is a valuable anti- 
arrhythmic option that should be performed in experienced centres 
before pregnancy if indicated.328 Implantable cardioverter defibrillators 
are indicated in a minority of patients with CPVT. 
6.2.4. Short QT syndrome 
Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a rare channelopathy characterized by 
short QT and increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias and 
AF.329 There are no case reports or studies published on pregnancy 
in women with SQTS. When choosing an anti-arrhythmic drug during 
pregnancy, quinidine is the best option in the absence of more robust 
data.330 
6.2.5. Labour and delivery in primary arrhythmia 
syndromes 
In all primary arrhythmia syndromes, delivery should be planned with 
heart rhythm monitoring, electrolyte control, and post-operative 
ECG monitoring until all anaesthetic drugs have been eliminated. 
Labour and delivery may be associated with acute pain, adrenaline 
release, and urgent administration of anaesthetic drugs, and therefore 
continuous telemetry monitoring is often warranted. In the absence 
of obstetric contraindications, vaginal delivery is generally recommended. Neuraxial anaesthesia reduces pain and therefore adrenergic 
activation which is specifically important in LQTS and CPVT. Women 
with LQTS and CPVT should continue beta-blocker therapy during labour and delivery. In women with CPVT, it is reasonable to keep 
the heart rate under the threshold for premature ventricular contraction onset during delivery, typically 100–110 b.p.m.331,332 Anaesthetic 
drugs for LQTS should be selected according to the CredibleMeds 
website (www.crediblemeds.org). 
In BrS, propofol and local anaesthetics with sodium-blocking agents 
(e.g. lidocaine) carry a theoretical risk of triggering arrhythmias. Case 
reports have indicated uneventful delivery with neuraxial anaesthesia 
in women with BrS.333 Thiopental and inhalation anaesthesia have so 
far not been associated with adverse events.324,333 Anaesthestic drugs 
should be chosen according the BrugadaDrugs website (www. 
brugadadrugs.org).

### 7 Peripartum cardiomyopathy

7.1. Epidemiology 
Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a potentially life-threatening condition 
defined as HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
<45%, without any other cause of HF, that occurs mainly during the 
peripartum period or in the months following delivery, termination, 
or miscarriage.339 Peripartum cardiomyopathy is essentially a diagnosis 
of exclusion and requires urgent management. 
Worldwide, PPCM is a complication of 1 of 2000 births,340 but incidence rates vary depending on the geographical region, ethnicity, and 
socioeconomic factors, with an incidence of 1–4/1000 births in the 
United States of America341,342 and 10/1000 births in the north- 
western region of Nigeria.343 Recent data from 49 countries showed 
that most women presented with PPCM in the post-partum 
stage.344–346 Risk factors for PPCM are shown in Figure 7. 
7.2. Mechanisms 
Recent trials suggest a ‘multiple hit’ theory for developing PPCM, with 
an accumulation of genetic and environmental risk factors (Figure 7). An 
overrepresentation of genetic variants in TTN, FLNC, BAG3, and DSP 
genes have been found in up to 15% of women with PPCM, with 
TTN truncating variants being the most common.347,348 The prevalence 
of these four genes in women with PPCM was comparable to the 
prevalence in DCM cohorts, supporting the similarity between PPCM 
and DCM. Genetic testing should therefore be considered in women 
with PPCM. 
There is growing evidence that several pathophysiological mechanisms in PPCM converge on a common pathway, which involves inflammation, unbalanced oxidative stress, and the generation of the 
anti-angiogenic 16 kDa prolactin. The 16 kDa prolactin induces 
endothelial dysfunction and damage, and subsequently leads to HF. 
Blocking prolactin with the dopamine D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine has emerged as a potential disease-specific therapy for 
PPCM.344,349–352 Additionally, the systemic or local increase in other 
anti-angiogenic factors, such as the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 
(sFlt-1) receptor, contributes to both local and widespread vascular 
dysfunction.353 
7.3. Diagnosis and clinical interventions 
Peripartum cardiomyopathy may present as subtle manifestations 
but most women with PPCM present with acute heart failure 
(AHF) with severe symptoms (NYHA III/IV). Mild to moderate symptomatic cases of PPCM are often mistaken for physiological changes 
associated with pregnancy, especially in the post-partum period. 
Myocarditis is a differential diagnosis and should be excluded by 
CMR.354 Women with PPCM and pre-eclampsia had a higher risk 
of adverse neonatal outcome but also a higher likelihood of left ventricular recovery (LVEF ≥50%).15 Diagnostic measures in a woman 
with suspected PPCM should include ECG, NPs, and echocardiography. The management strategy should be discussed within the 
Pregnancy Heart Team, considering maternal and foetal outcomes 
(Figure 7). Foetal prematurity and low birth weight are common in 
mothers with PPCM, and children of these mothers have a 3.4 times 
higher incidence of cardiovascular disease and 5 times higher 
mortality.355 
Treatment of AHF caused by PPCM follows the main principles 
of AHF management during and after pregnancy (Section 12.6). 
Mechanical circulatory support should be considered in women with 
persistent cardiogenic shock despite medical treatment.356,357 
Most medications used in the management of HF are foetotoxic and 
thus contraindicated during pregnancy (i.e. ACE-Is, ARBs, MRAs, and 
SGLT2 inhibitors).339 In the post-partum period, full HF treatment 
In women carrying a LQTS P/LP variant and who are phenotype-negative, use of beta-blockersc during pregnancy, post-partum, and 
lactation should be considered.148

can be initiated, except if lactation and breastfeeding are necessary for 
nutritional reasons, in which case ARBs and SGLT2 inhibitors should be 
avoided. Spironolactone is considered safe (see Section 5.2.7 and  
Figure 7). 
In addition to HF treatment, the prolactin production suppressing 
agent bromocriptine may be considered in women with PPCM 
(Figure 7).358–360 A secondary effect of bromocriptine is stopping 
lactation, which enables the possibility of full HF treatment of the 
mother that is not breastfeeding. The downsides of stopping lactation 
as PPCM treatment include psychological implications for the mother 
and the source of nutrition for the infant. These considerations indicate 
that women with moderate and severe HF in PPCM are the preferred 
candidates for bromocriptine treatment. A recent multi-centre randomized study comparing two different bromocriptine dosages in women

with severe PPCM (2.5 mg daily for 1 week vs 5 mg daily for 2 weeks 
followed by 2.5 mg daily for 6 weeks) observed a high LV recovery 
rate at 6 months. No significant differences were observed between 
treatment over 1 week and 8 weeks, suggesting that a 1 week addition 
of bromocriptine to standard heart failure treatment would be beneficial.358 There are limited data on the use of bromocriptine in pregnant 
women with PPCM and cardiogenic shock.339,361 Personalized bromocriptine treatment, with dose adjustments to effectively suppress prolactin, may be a viable therapeutic option in these specific cases. Adding 
LMWH (in prophylactic doses at a minimum) to bromocriptine should 
be considered to reduce the thromboembolic risk.362 
7.4. Outcomes 
Risk stratification is crucial to determine the appropriate level of care for 
women diagnosed with PPCM (Figure 7). Key indicators to identify individuals at risk of complications include LVEF <30%, LV end-diastolic 
diameter >60 mm, biventricular dysfunction, ECG QT interval prolongation, delayed diagnosis, and Middle Eastern or African ethnicity and/or 
geography.344 Additional parameters such as age (>40 or <20 years), 
antepartum diagnosis, haemodynamic parameters at presentation, and 
cardiac biomarkers can further refine risk stratification. 
PPCM may cause ventricular tachyarrhythmias and patients should 
therefore be monitored.363,364 As ∼50% of women with PPCM recover 
within 1 year after delivery, a wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) 
for pregnant women with LVEF <35% at risk of sudden cardiac death 
may be considered to provide bridging therapy to recovery.365,366 
Myocardial recovery after PPCM, defined as LVEF >50%, has been 
shown to occur in 46% (25%–62% according to geographical region) 
of women at 6 months.16 Full HF treatment should be given during the 
first year after complete LV function recovery. Stepwise discontinuation 
of HF therapy may be considered after 1 year if complete myocardial recovery is achieved, assuming that no genetic predisposition has been 
identified.339,367 However, recent data indicated higher risk of LVEF relapse during subsequent pregnancies in PPCM women who had discontinued their HF medication.368 Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or 
heart transplantation have been reported in up to 10% of PPCM cases, 
with inferior survival rates compared to other age-adjusted heart transplant recipients.340 
Outcomes after PPCM differ globally.344 The EURObservational 
Research Programme’s (EORP) PPCM registry reported low mortality 
rates369 of 2.4% 1 month after diagnosis.370 However, the mortality 
rate at 6 months was 6%, with HF and cardiac arrest as the most frequent causes of death.16 At 1 year follow-up, death from any cause occurred in 8% of women, with regional variations (Europe 5%, Africa 6%, 
Asia–Pacific 9%, Middle East 19%; P < .001).17 
Women with a previous PPCM diagnosis face a notably elevated risk 
of poor outcomes. In the most recent EORP paper following women 
with subsequent pregnancies after PPCM, risk of maternal mortality 
was lower than in previous reports, at 2% at 198 days after delivery.368 
More than mild LV dysfunction before a new pregnancy increases the risk 
of LVEF deterioration, but also women with recovered LV functions remained at risk of relapse.368 In women planning a new pregnancy after a 
previous PPCM and with only mild LV dysfunction, stress echo without 
contraindicated HF medication may be helpful to further stratify risk. 
Having a good contractile reserve after HF medication has been discontinued may be an encouraging prognostic sign.371 If planning a new pregnancy after PPCM, discontinuation of beta-blocking therapy may not be 
advisable, and restarting beta-blocking therapy may be beneficial at a subsequent pregnancy, irrespective of baseline LV systolic function.368 
8. Pregnancy in women with 
aortopathies 
Acute arterial dissection during pregnancy occurs in 5.5/100 000 live 
births, with the aorta being the third most frequent location (19.8%) 
after coronary artery dissection (38.2%) and vertebral artery dissection 
(22.9%).378 A large cohort study reported an aortic dissection rate of 
5.5 per million women during pregnancy and post-partum, compared 
with 1.4 per million during the equivalent period 1 year later.40 
Although rare, acute aortic syndromes carry high foetal and maternal 
morbidity and mortality risks.378,379 Arterial dissections occur antenatally in 15%, intrapartum in 23%, and post-partum in 62% of cases.378 
Most pregnancy-related aortic dissections occur in women who are unaware of their underlying aortic disease380 and events rarely occur in 
women who have been monitored according to guidelines.7 The risk 
of peripartum dissection in more distal aortic segments remains after 
prior aortic root replacement.381 The mechanism for dissection during 
pregnancy is unclear. Given the high post-partum prevalence, haemodynamic changes alone do not fully explain the increased risk and hormonal influences are likely involved. 
8.1. Women with heritable thoracic aortic 
disease 
The number of genes associated with heritable thoracic aortic disease 
(HTAD) is steadily increasing. Although there is clear evidence for an 
increased risk of aortic dissection in HTAD, recent data from the

ROPAC III study showed that the aortic dissection incidence rate (3.5%) 
in pregnant women with HTAD was lower than previously reported.382 
Phenotypes and outcomes between different genes and variants vary, 
are of clinical importance, and impose differences in management with 
regard to the extent of imaging, surveillance, and referral for surgery.62,383 Clinical and genetic entities for which data are available are 
discussed below and included in Figure 8. 
8.1.1. Marfan syndrome 
Marfan syndrome (MFS) is caused by P/LP variants in FBN1. 
Pregnancy-associated cardiovascular events include aortic and coronary 
artery dissection as well as rapid aortic growth necessitating surgery.384 
Aortic event rates can reach up to 10%. Although type A dissections 
mainly occur in undiagnosed women, often with aortic diameters exceeding surgical thresholds,389 type B dissections remain unpredictable 
and can occur even after prophylactic root replacement.390 Women diagnosed earlier in life have a lower risk of dissection.391 More dissections 
occur during the post-partum period than during pregnancy or at delivery.384,392 Event rates and overall maternal mortality are low in women 
under guidelines-based follow-up.7,390 Studies have shown stable aortic 
root diameters during pregnancy in women with diameters between 40 
and 45 mm.384,393 No significant difference in aortic events is noted between ever-pregnant and never-pregnant women,384,392 but most data 
come from patients in highly controlled environments. 
8.1.2. Loeys–Dietz syndrome 
Loeys–Dietz syndrome (LDS) is linked to P/LP variants in six genes: 
TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD2, SMAD3, TGFB2, and TGFB3. Aortic outcomes 
in LDS vary by gene and variant,64 leading to gene-specific recommendations for aortic root surgery thresholds.62,383,388 Planned pregnancy is a 
known risk factor, but data on dissection risk during pregnancy, including 
diameters at dissection, are limited. Cases of type B dissection after aortic 
root replacement have been reported.394 A higher incidence of haemorrhagic events, reported in earlier studies,395 was not corroborated in a 
recent ROPAC III study.382 Although pregnancy data for women with 
LDS are sparse, recent reports suggest favourable maternal and foetal 
outcomes with appropriate counselling and surveillance.395 The lack of 
data about aortic diameters at dissection during pregnancy limits high- 
level recommendations for prophylactic aortic root surgery thresholds. 
8.1.3. Vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome 
With a reported pregnancy-related mortality rate of 5% and life- 
threatening vascular events in up to 10% of pregnancies, women with 
vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome undeniably have high-risk pregnancies.396 Pregnancy-related complications include vascular dissection 
or rupture, uterine rupture, perineal tears, haemorrhage, and premature birth. However, pregnancy and delivery do not seem to affect 
overall survival rates in women with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.397 The risk may be lower for some women with specific genetic 
variants, null mutations, and normal vascular imaging.398,399 Celiprolol is 
recommended (also in normotensive women), given the very high risk 
of dissections and the benefit demonstrated in non-pregnant populations.7 Shared decision-making is crucial for these women. A ROPAC 
study included four women with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome 
who experienced pregnancy without adverse maternal events.7 Based 
on data from a recent systematic review, caesarean section at 37 weeks 
should be scheduled to avoid obstetrical complications.400 Women 
with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome should be counselled on pregnancy risk and monitored by a Pregnancy Heart Team. 
8.1.4. Non-syndromic heritable thoracic aortic 
diseases 
The number of genes linked to non-syndromic heritable thoracic aortic 
diseases (nsHTAD) is growing, including those rarely associated with 
extra-aortic features such as MYLK, ACTA2, MYH11, and PRKG1.401,402 
For most cases, specific pregnancy management recommendations are 
limited. Pragmatically, prophylactic surgery in nsHTAD is recommended 
at a diameter >45 mm. In women with variants in PRKG1, certain ACTA2 
variants, or additional risk factors that carry a high dissection risk at small 
diameters, such as hypertension or family history of dissection at smaller 
diameters, surgery may be considered at lower diameters (>40 mm).386 
8.1.5. Aortic disease with no identifiable (likely) 
pathogenic variant 
It is unclear whether young women with known aortic disease in whom 
genetic screening fails to identify a P/LP variant truly have a lower dissection risk than those with a known variant. The term ‘sporadic aneurysm’ is discouraged, as an aneurysm may stem from a heritable disorder 
even without a family history. Recent data from a large cohort of type A 
aortic dissection patients <30 years of age showed a near dichotomy 
between HTAD and unknown hypertension as probable dissection 
causes.403 
8.2. Turner syndrome 
Approximately 50% of women with Turner syndrome (TS) have 
cardiovascular manifestations, including aortic dilatation, bicuspid aortic 
valve (BAV), aortic coarctation, elongated aortic arch, and partial abnormal pulmonary venous return.404,405 All women with TS present 
a generalized arteriopathy and TS itself is an independent risk factor 
for thoracic aortic dilatation. Aortic dissection risk (85% type A and 
15% type B) increases with increasing diameters and can be reduced 
by following treatment guidelines.406–409 Risk factors include hypertension, BAV, and coarctation. In women with TS and an aortic size index 
(ASI) ≥25 mm/m2, aortic height index ≥25 mm/m or a z-score >4, the 
increased dissection risk and the option of surgery before pregnancy 
should be discussed with the patient and the Pregnancy Heart Team, 
taking the other risk factors into account.410–412 Spontaneous pregnancy can occur in women with mosaic TS, but assisted fertility techniques are now more common. Timely cardiovascular evaluation 
before fertility treatment is very important. Higher rates of adverse 
events during pregnancy and post-partum have been reported 
including hypertensive disease, gestational diabetes, haemorrhage, and 
SGA babies.413,414 Caesarean section rates of up to 67% have been 
reported.414 
8.3. Bicuspid aortic valve disease 
Available data for patients with BAV indicate a low risk of aortic events 
if the aorta is <45 mm. Data on pregnancy in women with diameters of 
45–50 mm are limited.7,415 Recent data on patients with BAV demonstrate a higher risk of dissection in those with a ‘root phenotype’ compared to those with a primarily ascending aorta involvement.416,417 
When counselling these patients, it is important to note that BAV 
does not exclude the possibility of nsHTAD.

8.4. Aortic aneurysms other than root or 
ascending aorta 
Currently there are no recommendations for prophylactic surgery before conceiving except for the aortic root and ascending aorta. Recently 
published guidelines recommended surgery for the undissected aortic 
arch, descending and abdominal aorta at 50 mm in patients with 
Marfan syndrome,62 but no specific guidelines for management in pregnancy are available. 
8.5. Aortic dissection 
Data about pregnancy in women with a history of aortic dissection are 
scarce. ROPAC II and III included 11 and 9 women, respectively, with a 
previous dissection and reported no maternal mortality. However, two 
women in ROPAC III had a recurrent aortic event.7,382 Adverse events 
are likely low in women with a history of traumatic or iatrogenic dissection and probably also for those with a maximum aortic diameter of 
<40 mm and documented stable follow-up. Obviously there is a selection bias, as many women with complex aortic disease choose not to 
have children independent of the risk of progression of aortic disease. 
8.6. Management 
Women with aortic disease should be managed by a multidisciplinary 
team with experts from both the Pregnancy Heart Team and the aortic team who are experienced in diagnostic pathways, medical and surgical management of aortopathies in the ante-, peri-, and post-partum 
periods. Institutional protocols for the management of pregnancy- 
related aortic events should be available and a shared-decision model 
needs to be applied. Imaging of the entire aorta (CT or CMR) in women with known or suspected aortic disease is recommended and 
can reasonably be performed for most clinical scenarios within the 
6 months prior to pregnancy. CMR without gadolinium is recommended in pregnant women with known aortopathy, without pre- 
pregnancy imaging. In all women with aortic disease, strict blood 
pressure control is recommended. Specific target values for this specific situation have not been studied—in the general population 
it is recommended that treated systolic blood pressure values be targeted to 120–129 mmHg to reduce CVD, provided the treatment is 
well tolerated.388,418 In women with genetic aortopathies, treatment 
with beta-blockers throughout pregnancy should be considered 
with foetal growth monitoring. Women who used beta-blockers

throughout pregnancy in the ROPAC III study gave birth to infants 
with a significantly lower birth weight than women who did not.382 
Specific thresholds for pre-conception aortic root surgery are illustrated in Figure 8. 
The mode of delivery needs to be informed by the patient’s history, 
presence and type of gene/variant, and aortic diameter. The primary 
aim of intrapartum management in women with aortic disease is to reduce the cardiovascular stress of labour and delivery. Caesarean section 
may be considered in women with a maximum diameter of >45 mm 
and those with a history of dissection. In women with an aortic diameter <40 mm, vaginal delivery is recommended. In women with MFS, 
LDS, and vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, pre-delivery anaesthesiology consultation is recommended to consider precautions for dural 
ectasia and scoliosis (including possible previous surgery).419 In general, 
an individualized approach is favoured.383 Given the peak risk of a dissection at day 6 post-partum, it may be appropriate for women to stay 
in hospital for 1 week post-partum.420 
8.7. Cardiac surgery during pregnancy 
Prophylactic cardiac surgery in women who are planning a pregnancy is far 
more common than urgent or emergency surgery during pregnancy. 
Aortic surgery is the most frequently performed procedure during pregnancy, followed by surgery for aortic and mitral valve disease. Key 
pregnancy-related pathologies include prosthetic valve thrombosis and 
endocarditis. The decision to perform surgery with extracorporeal circulation and cardioplegic arrest during pregnancy is highly individualized with no 
specific guidelines available. A recent meta-analysis421 reported a maternal 
mortality rate of 7.3% consistent across trimesters, and no difference in maternal mortality if caesarean section was performed. Overall foetal mortality was 26.5%, lowest during third trimester surgeries (10.3%). Caesarean 
section before surgery significantly reduces foetal mortality. The decision 
to perform a caesarean section prior to surgery should be based on foetal 
viability and the level of medical care available rather than on a fixed gestational age. This is particularly crucial in acute type A aortic dissection. 
Hypothermic distal circulatory arrest increases foetal mortality.422

### 9 Pregnancy in women with known

congenital heart disease 
Congenital heart disease is present in 0.8%–0.9% of live births, with significant geographical variation.448,449 Nowadays, most children born with congenital heart disease reach fertile age, even those with complex lesions, 
making adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) one of the most frequent 
CVDs during pregnancy.450 Discussions about family planning, contraception, pregnancy risk (mWHO 2.0—see Table 6), and life expectancy are essential and should start early, preferably during the transition to adult life.2 
In the prospective ROPAC registry, most women with ACHD (n =  
3295) had a relatively favourable pregnancy outcome, with an overall 
mortality rate of 0.2% and trends improving from 2007 to 2017.2 
Heart failure rates were low in ROPAC, with differences according 
to disease complexity (13% in severe, 5%–6% in less-complex lesions). 
Arrhythmia rates were low overall (2%). Women with uncorrected 
ACHD more often have maternal and foetal complications.451 
Women with ACHD experiencing complications during pregnancy 
and post-partum may also be at higher risk of late cardiac events.451 
Pre-pregnancy evaluation should at least include routine blood tests, 
ECG, TTE, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. As mentioned in 
Section 4, the increased transmission risk should be discussed, and genetic counselling should be offered.452 The level and timing of the pre- 
pregnancy cardiovascular evaluation and follow-up during pregnancy 
depend on the mWHO 2.0 class (see Table 6), taking the anatomical 
and functional status into account. 
Optimization of cardiac status and any comorbidities should take place 
prior to pregnancy. This includes guideline-directed elective surgery or/and

well as optimizing medical therapy and healthy lifestyle choices. 
The timing and mode of delivery should be decided by the 
Pregnancy Heart Team, for all women with a condition of mWHO 
2.0 class II–III or above. In general, vaginal delivery is the preferred delivery mode in women with ACHD.163 Post-partum monitoring should 
be individualized based on the woman’s underlying ACHD, risk or 
presence of arrhythmias and/or HF, and the course during pregnancy 
and delivery. High-risk women or those with HF symptoms during 
pregnancy or delivery should be considered for intensive (cardiac) 
care admission for haemodynamic monitoring.183 For more details 
about managing the various delivery stages, including post-partum,

### 10 Pregnancy in women with

pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as a mean pulmonary 
arterial pressure >20 mmHg, derived from invasive right-heart catheterization, and is classified by aetiology and pathophysiology.490 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is pre-capillary PH characterized by a pulmonary vascular resistance >2 Wood units and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤15 mmHg. Untreated, idiopathic PAH 
results in death within a median of 2.8 years, but with PAH therapies, 
median survival extends to over 7 years.491,492 There is a preponderance of females in the incidence of PAH, and this includes women of 
childbearing age. The first clinical manifestations may be seen in 
pregnancy.493 
Women with PAH should be managed by a Pregnancy Heart Team, 
and a PH expert experienced in diagnostic pathways, medical treatment, and anticoagulation management from the ante- to the peri- 
and post-partum period. 
10.1. Pre-existing pulmonary arterial 
hypertension 
In women with PAH, maternal and foetal outcomes vary according to the 
PAH subset. With improved treatment of PAH and a multidisciplinary 
approach during pregnancy and the peri-partum period, maternal mortality has declined but remains high, ranging from 11% to 25%.2,490,494,495 
10.1.1. Maternal and foetal risk 
Although there is no safe cut-off for elevated pulmonary artery pressure and risk, pregnancies with mild PAH and vasoreactive PAH 
seem to have better maternal and foetal outcomes than those with 
moderate to severe PAH.141,496–498 Women with severe PAH, non- 
vasoreactive idiopathic PAH, and Eisenmenger syndrome have the highest risk of maternal and foetal mortality.496,497,499–502 As the clinical 
course of PAH during pregnancy remains associated with unforeseeable risks and pregnancy may accelerate PAH progression, all women 
with PAH496 wishing to become pregnant should be counselled by a 
multidisciplinary team regarding the very high risk of pregnancy-related 
adverse events. 
Women with Eisenmenger syndrome are unlikely to tolerate pregnancy due to additional risks of RV failure and paradoxical emboli. 
Chronic cyanosis may worsen due to systemic vasodilatation during 
pregnancy, an increased right-to-left shunt, and decreased pulmonary 
blood flow. 
Foetal and neonatal mortality risk is high in women with PAH, mainly related to pre-term delivery, reduced maternal CO, and/or hypoxaemia.503 Miscarriage is common. If oxygen saturation is >90%, there 
is usually a better foetal outcome (10% foetal loss). If oxygen saturation is <85%, miscarriage, IUGR, prematurity, and foetal death are 
common (live birth rate of only 12%).504,505 
10.1.2. Counselling and contraception 
Women of childbearing potential with PAH should be counselled 
at the time of diagnosis about the very high risk and uncertainties associated with becoming pregnant. Clear advice against becoming 
pregnant, including referral for psychological support if needed, 
and clear contraceptive advice are required, taking into account the 
woman’s individual needs. Reduced efficacy of hormonal contraceptives should be carefully considered and discussed with women treated with ERAs, as well as the addition of barrier methods for 
contraception.490,493 
10.1.3. Management during pregnancy 
When pregnancy occurs, termination should be discussed. Rigorous 
planning with the optimization of targeted PAH therapies and close 
monitoring are key in managing women with PAH who wish to continue with the pregnancy after appropriate counselling on the high maternal and foetal risks. 
Bed rest may be required in symptomatic women, and it may be appropriate to avoid additional risk factors (such as air travel). Right-heart 
catheterization can be performed to assist management in women 
showing deterioration. 
Diuretics may be needed in women with HF, and iron deficiency 
should be treated.43 It is recommended to stop ERAs, riociguat, and 
selexipag because of potential or unknown teratogenicity.43,490 
PAH therapies that can be used during pregnancy include 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and prostacyclin analogues. Sildenafil 
is used in the vast majority of women and is combined with a prostacyclin analogue depending on the disease severity. The subset of women with true vasodilator responsiveness who are well controlled on 
CCB therapy should continue taking this during pregnancy.43,490,506

### Page 48

In women with Eisenmenger syndrome, caution is warranted when 
administering drugs that may lead to sudden systemic vasodilation or 
a risk of paradoxical air embolism (i.v. line filters should be used for 
i.v. therapies). Thromboembolism is a major risk, and anticoagulation 
regimens (type and dosage) should be considered individually, balancing the risk of bleeding vs VTE at each stage of pregnancy. LMWH 
is most commonly used. Regular follow-up is advisable, initially every 
2–4 weeks and then weekly in the third trimester. Women need to be 
monitored for increasing hypoxaemia and symptoms of HF, including 
breathlessness, syncope, and congestion. Regular echocardiography 
and blood testing, including NP levels, can provide evidence of HF 
where appropriate. 
10.2. New diagnosis in pregnancy 
The usual diagnostic algorithm as per the 2022 ESC/ERS Guidelines 
for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension should 
be followed in a pregnant woman with suspected PAH. Right-heart 
catheterization should be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty in identifying de novo PAH in pregnancy and to assist with important therapeutic decisions.490 If this is required, it should be 
performed in a specialized centre. An individualized approach is required for starting PAH therapies. Many centres start therapy with 
oral sildenafil. Close follow-up by an experienced Pregnancy Heart 
Team with a PH expert is needed and prompt escalation of PAH 
therapy, usually with i.v. epoprostenol, is indicated depending on 
the disease severity. 
10.3. Delivery in women with pulmonary 
arterial hypertension 
A detailed delivery plan, including the optimal mode and timing of delivery, should be provided on a timely basis by the Pregnancy Heart 
Team with a PH expert. Early delivery, with careful tracking of foetal 
growth, is often required in women with progressive, decompensated 
HF not responding to PAH therapies and to reduce the risk of an unplanned birth outside an expert centre.245 Therapeutic LMWH 
should be stopped 24 h prior to any mode of delivery to reduce 
the risk of maternal haemorrhage. Caesarean section providing for 
a more controlled delivery may be preferred over vaginal delivery.494,507 Regional anaesthesia is usually favoured over general 
anaesthesia. 
10.3.1. Peri- and post-partum monitoring 
Due to the rapid changes in haemodynamics, the post-partum period is 
particularly high risk, with the majority of maternal mortality occurring 
after delivery.245 During delivery and post-delivery, women should be 
monitored in the intensive care setting with ECG, pulse oximetry, 
CO monitoring, meticulous fluid balance with central venous pressure 
monitoring, and optimization of RV function all important determinants 
of a good outcome. Women remain at high risk for many months after 
delivery, and individualized counselling is required to discuss the need 
for ongoing therapies and the avoidance of future pregnancies. In women with severe PAH and those who had complications during pregnancy and/or delivery, optimization of PAH therapies should be 
prioritized over lactation. 
11. Venous thromboembolism in 
pregnancy and post-partum 
11.1. Epidemiology and maternal risk 
Venous thromboembolism includes PE and DVT. The pooled incidence of 
pregnancy-related VTE (including post-partum) is 1.2 per 1000 deliveries510, and it is a major cause of pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality.510 Pregnancy-related VTE has a fatality rate of 0.68% and a recurrence 
rate (during pregnancy and post-partum) of 4.27%, which is higher post- 
partum.510 A documented assessment of VTE risk factors is recommended before or in early pregnancy. The VTE risk is highest in the third 
trimester and in the first 6 weeks post-partum.510 Mortality in 
pregnancy-related VTE is associated with CVD, hypertension, twin gestation, pre-term birth, caesarean section, transfusion, and black ethnicity.511 
11.2. Risk factors for pregnancy-related 
venous thromboembolism 
Pregnancy is accompanied by physiological changes leading to an 
increased VTE risk. First, increased procoagulant activity as well as decreased physiological anticoagulant and fibrinolytic activity result in a hypercoagulable state.512,513 Second, the expanding uterus causes 
mechanical compression of the inferior vena cava and the pelvic veins, 
leading to impeded venous flow.512,513 In addition, non-pregnancy- 
related and pregnancy- or delivery-related conditions may modify the individual VTE risk (see Supplementary data online, Table S5). 
In pregnancy, as well as in the early post-partum period, an emerging 
suspicion of VTE requires immediate diagnostic clarification.

11.3. Prevention of venous 
thromboembolism 
Thromboprophylaxis follows an individualized risk assessment weighing 
the VTE risk against the bleeding risk ante- and post-partum. 
11.3.1. Pregnant women with no prior indications for 
long-term anticoagulation 
If prevention and treatment of VTE are initiated in the antepartum period, continuation for up to 6 weeks post-partum should be considered. 
In women with low-risk thrombophilia without a history of VTE, routine antepartum thromboprophylaxis is not required.514 In women 
with a history of VTE or a high-risk thrombophilia, medical thromboprophylaxis is recommended (Table 13). In women with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after in vitro fertilization, thromboprophylaxis is 
recommended during the first trimester.515,516 
The drug class of choice for the prevention and treatment of 
pregnancy-related VTE is LMWH.517,518 Fondaparinux may be considered as an alternative. A randomized controlled trial comparing a 
weight-adjusted intermediate-dose LMWH with a fixed low-dose 
LMWH regimen found that weight adjustment did not reduce the 
risk of recurrent VTE in the combined ante- and post-partum periods.519 Post-hoc analyses suggested a higher efficacy of weight-adjusted 
intermediate-dose LMWH in the post-partum period only, but this 
needs to be confirmed by future studies. In morbidly obese women, 
weight-based prophylactic dosing (considering anti-factor Xa measurement) instead of fixed dosing might be more appropriate.198 
11.3.2. Pregnant women with prior indication for 
long-term anticoagulation 
In case of pre-existing oral anticoagulation therapy due to previous 
VTE, oral anticoagulation (DOAC or VKA) should be replaced by 
LMWH at recognition of pregnancy.517 
11.4. Management of acute venous 
thromboembolism 
11.4.1. Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
11.4.1.1. Deep vein thrombosis 
The expanding uterus potentially reduces the blood flow in the iliocaval 
veins. In addition, a constitutional narrowing of the left-sided common 
iliac vein between the spine and the crossing artery could contribute to 
an increased risk of left-sided iliofemoral thrombosis.520 The clinical 
LEFt criteria (L = Left, symptoms in the left leg; E = Edema, calf circumference difference ≥2 cm; Ft = First trimester of presentation) may be 
used to identify low risk of pregnancy-related DVT.521,522 In pregnant 
women with suspicion of acute DVT, immediate diagnostic clarification 
is indicated (Figure 9).

11.4.1.2. Pulmonary embolism 
Clinical signs and symptoms of PE in pregnancy do not differ from those of 
PE in non-pregnant women. The diagnostic approach in haemodynamically 
stable pregnant women with suspicion of PE aims to reduce the need for 
computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) by implementing 
additional diagnostic strategies, such as clinical features, D-dimer, and venous ultrasound. Levels of D-dimer increase physiologically up to 39% per 
trimester.524 A multinational study demonstrated the efficiency of a diagnostic strategy involving clinical probability, D-dimer measurements 
(threshold <500 µg/L), and peripheral venous compression ultrasound 
to reduce the need for CTPA.525 Using both the YEARS criteria (1, clinical 
signs of acute DVT; 2, haemoptysis; 3, PE is the most likely diagnosis) and 
adapted D-dimer thresholds allows a further reduction in the need for 
CTPA (D-dimer threshold if YEARS criteria present <500 µg/L, if 
YEARS criteria absent <1000 µg/L).526 Another meta-analysis confirmed 
the value of including D-dimer in a diagnostic algorithm to rule out PE in 
pregnant women with suspicion of PE (Figure 10).527 
11.4.2. Treatment of venous thromboembolism 
in pregnancy 
In pregnant women with a suspicion of VTE, anticoagulation with therapeutic LMWH should be commenced immediately, even before imaging, 
until the diagnosis of VTE is either excluded or confirmed. In pregnant women with confirmed acute VTE, therapeutic anticoagulation with weight- 
adjusted LMWH based on early pregnancy weight is recommended by 
using either a twice-daily or a once-daily regimen, each one resulting in 
a therapeutic daily dose518 (see also Section 5.2.1). Currently, there is insufficient evidence to favour once- or twice-daily regimens.217,218,518

Despite fluctuations of anti-factor Xa levels during pregnancy, routine 
anti-factor Xa monitoring does not affect clinical outcomes and should 
only be considered in women with renal insufficiency or obesity.211–213 
Fondaparinux may be considered as an alternative. In unstable pregnant 
women with PE, UFH may be used in the initial phase of therapeutic 
anticoagulation. 
After delivery, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation should be administered 
for a minimum of 6 weeks, up to an overall duration of 3 months, except 
for cases in which an indefinite duration of anticoagulation is indicated.510,529 LMWH or VKAs may be given during lactation. A more detailed discussion of anticoagulants in the lactation period can be found in 
Section 5. Thrombolytic or interventional treatment of PE is not recommended in the peripartum period and should only be considered in women 
with high-risk PE after consultation with a specialized multidisciplinary 
team. In pregnant women with acute iliofemoral DVT, interventional 
thrombus removal should not routinely be performed. Data on the effectiveness and risks of the placement of temporary inferior vena cava filters 
for the prevention of PE in pregnant women are limited but appear to 
be comparable to non-pregnant women. Due to limited data and potential 
complications associated with the inferior vena cava filters, their placement 
should be limited to recurrent VTE despite appropriate anticoagulation or 
contraindication to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation therapy.530,531 
11.5. Management of delivery and the 
post-partum period 
For pregnant women receiving a prophylactic dose of anticoagulation, 
there is no specific need for a planned delivery. However, pregnant women receiving a therapeutic dose of anticoagulation need a planned delivery with prior discontinuation of LMWH to prevent spontaneous 
delivery in a period of full anticoagulation. Details for the management 
of anticoagulation during pregnancy and delivery, including for VTE, are 
provided in Sections 4.5.6. and 5.2.1. 
12. Pregnancy in women with 
acquired heart disease 
12.1. Acute chest pain in pregnancy 
Diagnostic evaluation for chest pain in pregnant women 
follows the same protocol as in non-pregnant women, including 
clinical examination, ECG, biomarkers and echocardiography 
(Figure 11).207,537,538 Importantly, spontaneous coronary artery 
dissection (SCAD) is a more prevalent cause of chest pain during 
pregnancy and in the early post-partum period than in non- 
pregnant women.539 
Treatment and management of the specific differential diagnoses 
should follow established respective guidelines. The specificity of 
D-dimer is reduced during pregnancy540,541 and women should not 
undergo chest CT based solely on D-dimer levels (Section 11). In suspected acute aortic syndromes, there should be a low threshold for 
aortic CT and consultation with the aortic team in emergencies 
(Section 8).542 
12.2. Coronary artery disease 
12.2.1. Acute coronary syndrome 
12.2.1.1. Coronary artery disease epidemiology and aetiology 
Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are a major cause of maternal 
death in developed countries, accounting for 20% of cardiovascular 
deaths.543 The risk of ACS is three to four times higher in pregnant 
women than in non-pregnant women of reproductive age,544 and 
mortality is estimated at 5%.545 Because the age at giving birth is 
increasing overall, ACS in pregnancy may become more common.546 Although ACS can occur at any stage of pregnancy, it is 
more common in the third trimester or post-partum.544 Classic 
ASCVD risk factors are associated with ACS during pregnancy.

### Page 54

Additional risk factors are pre-eclampsia, thrombophilia, transfusion, post-partum infection, multiparity, and PPH. Pregnancies 
that required fertility treatment have not been shown to have an 
increased risk of ACS.547 
Pregnancy-associated SCAD is the single most frequent cause of ACS 
during pregnancy and post-partum (43%),548 followed by atherosclerotic 
lesion (27%), coronary embolism (17%), and vasospasm (2%).239 
Coronary thromboembolism may be due to pregnancy-related hypercoagulability and paradoxical embolization.549 Vasospasm has been associated with the use of ergot derivatives prescribed for lactation 
suppression or to treat PPH.549 
12.2.1.2. Presentation and diagnosis 
Clinical presentation of ACS in pregnancy is the same as in the non- 
pregnant population. However, pregnant women with SCAD tend 
to have a more severe clinical presentation than women with 
non-SCAD ACS.550–553 
An ACS in pregnancy should be suspected in women presenting with 
cardiac arrest, acute onset chest pain, dyspnoea, ischaemic changes on 
ECG, or elevated cardiac biomarkers.551,554 Diagnostic evaluation 
should follow ACS strategies (Figure 11).555–557 Major ischaemic ECG 
changes due to pregnancy itself are not expected (Figure 1). 
Invasive coronary angiography during pregnancy should be reserved 
for those with ACS, or when other diagnostic methods are inappropriate. ECG changes, such as transient ST-segment depression and T-wave 
inversion can be normal during pregnancy, but a serum troponin rise 
suggests myocardial injury as in non-pregnant women. ST elevation is 
not normal in pregnancy and warrants urgent attention.558 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in pregnant women involves the anterior wall in 70%–80% of cases.239,558 In more than half 
the cases, a reduction of LVEF <40% is observed, leading to a high incidence of complications.20 Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive 
coronary arteries (MINOCA) should be considered a working diagnosis 
warranting further investigation.559 
12.2.1.3. Pregnancy-associated spontaneous coronary artery 
dissection 
Pregnancy-associated SCAD affects 1.81 per 100 000 pregnancies560 
and may occur at any time during or after pregnancy, although >70% 
occur early post-partum, most commonly within the first week.550 
Multiple predisposing factors have been described, including oestrogen 
and progesterone surges causing structural changes to the coronary tunica media. SCAD predominantly occurs in the left-sided coronaries, 
with multivessel involvement.561 
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in SCAD is associated 
with an increased risk of complications, particularly iatrogenic dissection and haematoma extension.562 For this reason, a conservative approach to revascularization is advised in clinically stable women with 
SCAD without active or ongoing ischaemia.539,563 If SCAD involves 
the left main coronary artery or proximal vessels, a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) may be considered depending on technical considerations and local expertise.539 A multidisciplinary team should 
decide whether the patient is a candidate for PCI or CABG. 
Optimal medical management following SCAD is unknown but is 
currently being investigated in an ongoing clinical trial.562 Limited observational data suggest that beta-blockers (e.g. labetalol) and avoiding 
hypertension may be associated with a lower risk of recurrent 
SCAD.564,565 The role of antiplatelet therapies in conservatively managed SCAD has been controversial, with evidence favouring single 
antiplatelet therapy with aspirin.563,566 Women with a history of 
SCAD should be carefully counselled regarding the risk of recurrent 
events in subsequent pregnancy.567,568 
12.2.2. Coronary artery interventions 
The indications for acute revascularization are comparable to those 
for non-pregnant women. In patients with high or very high-risk ACS, 
immediate coronary angiography and PCI, if indicated, are recommended.557 Moreover, an early invasive strategy with coronary angiography is recommended for pregnant women with a confirmed or a 
working diagnosis of non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE ACS) and with a 
high index of suspicion for unstable angina. In atherosclerotic lesions557 
PCI is indicated when there is ongoing or recurrent chest pain, haemodynamic instability, or ongoing ischaemia due to functionally significant 
coronary stenoses or acute occlusions.122 
The choice of coronary stents should not be different from that for 
non-pregnant women. Duration of DAPT should follow recommendations for non-pregnant patients with an individual approach considering ischaemic and delivery-related risks, including bleeding risk during delivery 
and neuraxial anaesthesia. Stents approved for short DAPT may be preferred during pregnancy in specific cases according to gestational age and 
timing of delivery. In the case of coronary embolism, thrombo-aspiration 
and/or a simple angioplasty can be performed.43,569 Invasive procedures 
should follow the ALARA principle (see Section 4.3.5). 
Systemic thrombolysis may be an alternative reperfusion strategy if 
timely PCI is not available. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator 
does not cross the placenta but can induce bleeding complications, including subplacental. 
12.2.3. Chronic coronary syndromes in pregnancy 
Pregnant women with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) are at high 
risk of adverse maternal and foetal outcomes: 32% have cardiovascular 
complications (including 9% with ischaemic cardiovascular complications) and there is 2% maternal mortality.570 The CARPREG II score, 
now also included in the mWHO 2.0 classification (Table 6, Section  
4), highlights the high risk of CCS as a predictor of maternal complications. When counselling women with CCS, pregnancy can preferably be 
considered when there is no residual ischaemia or LV dysfunction 12 
months after an index event. 
12.2.4. Management and delivery 
Women with ACS or CCS should be managed by a Pregnancy Heart 
Team. Treatment should be tailored to the underlying pathophysiology, 
although foetal considerations may affect the choice of therapy.50,571 
All pregnant women with ACS and their foetus should be monitored 
at an intensive cardiac care unit. 
The mode of delivery in a patient with gestational ACS or CCS 
should be determined by obstetric considerations and the clinical status 
of the mother. A vaginal delivery is indicated in most women with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Vaginal delivery eliminates the 
potential risks associated with general anaesthesia and a major surgical 
procedure. Clopidogrel must be withheld a minimum of 5 days before 
neuraxial anaesthesia to reduce the risk of epidural hematoma.572 An 
elective caesarean section avoids a long or stressful labour and allows 
better control of the time of delivery. A plan for emergency delivery 
of a potentially viable foetus in case of sudden maternal deterioration 
should also be established. An arbitrary minimum time to delivery in 
stable women is at 2 weeks after ACS.18 
Lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapy are described in Section 5.

12.3. Hypertensive disorders 
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the second most common medical complications (after PPH), affecting 5%–15% of pregnancies worldwide, and are a major cause of maternal, foetal, and neonatal morbidity 
and mortality.583 Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy include pre-existing 
hypertension (chronic hypertension), gestational hypertension, and pre- 
eclampsia (Table 14). Over recent years an upward incidence trend has 
been observed due to older age at first childbirth and rising prevalence 
of obesity.586,587 Maternal risks include placental abruption, stroke, 
multiple organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.588 
Table 14 Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 
A. Pre-existing (chronic) hypertension  
Hypertension which either precedes pregnancy or develops before 20 weeks gestation, usually persisting >6 weeks post-partum, and which may be associated with 
proteinuria.  
(1) 
Primary hypertension  
(2) 
Secondary hypertension  
(3) 
White-coat hypertension  
(4) 
Masked hypertension  
B. Gestational hypertension 
Hypertension which develops after 20 weeks gestation and usually resolves within 6 weeks post-partum. 
Transient gestational hypertension 
Usually detected in the clinic but then settles with repeated BP measurements taken over several hours; associated with a 40% risk of developing true gestational 
hypertension or pre-eclampsia in the remainder of the pregnancy, thus requiring careful follow-up. 
C. Pre-eclampsia 
Gestational hypertension accompanied by one or more of the following new-onset conditions at or after 20 weeks gestation: 
• Proteinuria [urinary albumin excretion in a 24 h urine sample >0.3 g/day or UACR in a random spot urine sample >30 mg/mmol (0.3 mg/mg)] 
• Other maternal organ dysfunction including: 
• Acute kidney injury (serum creatinine ≥90 μmol/L; 1 mg/dL) 
• Liver dysfunction (elevated ALT or AST >40 IU/L; >0.67 μkat/L with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain) 
• Neurological complications (e.g. eclampsia/convulsions, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, clonus, severe headaches, persistent visual scotomata) 
• Haematological complications (platelet count <150 000/μL, disseminated intravascular coagulation, haemolysis) 
• Uteroplacental dysfunction (IUGR, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveform analysis, or stillbirth).  
D. Pre-existing hypertension + superimposed pre-eclampsia 
Pre-existing hypertension associated with any of the above maternal organ dysfunctions consistent with pre-eclampsia or a further increase in BP with new-onset 
proteinuria. 
E. Antenatally unclassifiable hypertension 
When BP is first recorded after 20 weeks gestation and hypertension is diagnosed, reassessment is necessary at or after 6 weeks post-partum. If hypertension 
resolves, it should be reclassified as gestational hypertension, whereas if hypertension persists, it should be reclassified as pre-existing/chronic hypertension.

The foetus is at high risk of IUGR prematurity, and intrauterine death 
(25%, 27%, and 4%, respectively, in cases of pre-eclampsia).589 
12.3.1. Definition and classification of hypertension in 
pregnancy 
Hypertension in pregnancy is typically defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP of ≥90 mmHg,585 
measured using repeated BP readings in the office or hospital on 
two separate occasions or ≥15 min apart in severe hypertension 
(≥160/110 mmHg).584,590 
12.3.1.1. Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia 
Pre-eclampsia is defined as gestational hypertension complicated by 
new onset of the laboratory or clinical changes reported in Table 14 
at or after 20 weeks. Eclampsia is defined as the new onset of seizures 
or coma in a pregnant woman with pre-eclampsia.584,585 
The combination of haemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated 
transaminases defines HELLP syndrome, which is usually considered 
to be a variant of pre-eclampsia.43 Risk factors for pre-eclampsia are described in Table 15. 
12.3.2. Diagnosis and risk assessment 
12.3.2.1. Blood pressure measurement 
Maternal BP should be assessed at each encounter and should be measured 
in the sitting position (or the left lateral recumbent position during labour) 
with an appropriately sized arm cuff at heart level and using Korotkoff V for 
diastolic BP. Mercury sphygmomanometers remain the gold standard for BP 
measurement in pregnancy as automatic devices tend to under-record BP 
and are unreliable in severe pre-eclampsia. Only automatic devices specifically validated for pregnancy should be used.584,591 
The diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy by ambulatory BP monitoring is superior to office BP measurements or home BP monitoring 
for the prediction of pregnancy outcomes.584,592 Ambulatory BP monitoring avoids unnecessary treatment of white-coat hypertension, and is 
useful in the management of high-risk pregnant women with hypertension and those with diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy.593,594 Either 
home BP monitoring or office BP measurements may be used alternatively or complementarily to diagnose hypertensive disorders during 
pregnancy in women at risk of pre-eclampsia. 
However, among pregnant women with pre-existing or gestational 
hypertension, home BP monitoring is not associated with better BP 
control compared with scheduled office BP measurements.584,595,596 
Either can be used for BP monitoring.595,596 
12.3.2.2. Laboratory tests 
Basic laboratory investigations recommended for monitoring hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include urinalysis, blood count, haematocrit, liver enzymes, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid. All 
pregnant women should be assessed for proteinuria in early pregnancy 
to detect pre-existing renal disease and, in the second half of pregnancy, 
to screen for pre-eclampsia.43 
In addition to basic laboratory tests, the following investigations may 
be considered: 
• Ultrasound of the adrenals, and plasma and urinary fractionated metanephrine assays. 
• Doppler ultrasound of uterine arteries (after 20 weeks of gestation).597 
• A ratio of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) to placental 
growth factor (PlGF) of <38 can be used to reliably exclude the development of pre-eclampsia over the next 7 days when clinically 
suspected.43,598  
If women with chronic hypertension are suspected of developing 
pre-eclampsia, testing for PlGF may help rule out pre-eclampsia between 20 and 36 weeks.599,600 
12.3.3. Management of hypertension in pregnancy 
Management of hypertension in pregnancy depends on the woman’s 
BP and gestational age, and the presence of associated maternal and foetal risk factors.601,602 In pregnant women with BP >160/110 mmHg, hospital admission is recommended603 (Figure 12A). If BP is ≥140–159/90– 
99 mmHg, BP control is mandatory with a BP target of <140/90 mmHg. 
In two large trials,583,604 tight diastolic BP control (<85–90 mmHg) in 
women with pre-existing hypertension was superior to less tight diastolic BP control (<100–105 mmHg) and caused no harm. 
In pregnant women with diagnosed hypertension, blood tests, clinical 
examination, and assessment of proteinuria are mandatory and should 
be repeated regularly.599 If a urine dipstick is positive or borderline for 
proteinuria, and symptoms and laboratory tests (including biomarker 
assessment) are indicative of pre-eclampsia, the diagnosis of pre- 
eclampsia can be made and hospital admission is recommended where 
there are clinical concerns.599 
12.3.3.1. Non-pharmacological management 
Pregnant women with hypertension should be advised to follow a 
healthy lifestyle including physical activity, smoking cessation, a healthy 
diet, and control of body weight. Lifestyle changes before and during 
pregnancy may ameliorate both maternal and foetal risks.605 Salt restriction is not advised to reduce hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, but it is reasonable for women with pre-existing hypertension 
to continue with a low sodium diet.584 Unless contraindicated, aerobic 
exercise should be recommended in pregnant women with hypertension to maintain ideal body weight and reduce adverse pregnancy

outcomes.606 Obese women are advised to avoid an increase in weight 
of more than ∼7 kg from pre-conception.601 
Calcium supplements are recommended for the prevention of pre- 
eclampsia in women with a low dietary intake of calcium (<600 mg/ 
day),607 where low-dose calcium supplementation (<1 g/day) has 
been shown to be as effective as high-dose (≥1 g/day).608 
12.3.3.2. Pharmacological treatment 
12.3.3.2.1. Mild hypertension (BP 140/90 – 159/109 mmHg). In 
mild gestational hypertension it seems reasonable to initiate treatment 
at BP values of 140/90 mmHg,583,609 whereas a diastolic BP reduction 
to <80 mmHg is not recommended. 
Methyldopa, beta-blockers (most data are available for labetalol), 
and dihydropyridine CCBs (most data are available for nifedipine) 
are the drugs of choice for mild gestational and pre-existing 
hypertension.584 
ACE-Is, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors are strictly contraindicated. 
Diuretics are not advised in gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, 
due to the reduction of intravascular volume and reduction of uteroplacental perfusion and thereby possible foetal adverse effects. 
12.3.3.2.2. Pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia may require hospital admission, but not all women will require ongoing hospitalization and care 
should be individualized (Figure 12B and Figure 12C). Women with 
at least one high-risk factor or two moderate-risk factors for pre- 
eclampsia (Table 15) should be advised to take 75–150 mg aspirin daily 
at bedtime from week 12 to week 36/37.599,610 We advise discontinuation of low-dose aspirin at week 36/37 when the aspirin indication is 
pre-eclampsia. 
Pre-eclampsia with severe features (severe hypertension with or 
without proteinuria, any hypertension grade with neurological, haematological, or cardiovascular complications, liver dysfunction, or renal 
dysfunction) should be managed with a magnesium sulfate infusion 
to prevent eclampsia, in addition to early delivery.43,611 Magnesium 
toxicity can present with cardiac effects, including ECG interval 
changes (prolonged PR, QRS, and QT intervals) at magnesium levels 
of 2.5–5 mmol/L, and can progress to atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction block, bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest at levels of 
6–10 mmol/L. If magnesium toxicity is suspected, it is recommended 
to stop the magnesium infusion and give 30 mL i.v. calcium gluconate.612–614

12.3.3.2.3. Severe hypertension (BP ≥160/110 mmHg). In severe 
hypertension, assessment and gradual BP reduction to <160/ 
110 mmHg is mandatory in a hospital setting. Continuous cardiotocographic monitoring is also compulsory. The selection of antihypertensive drugs and the route of administration depend on initial diagnosis, 
expected delivery time, presence or absence of pre-eclampsia, and 
the preferences and experience of the attending physicians.43,611 
Recent comprehensive meta-analyses comparing commonly used antihypertensive drugs (e.g. oral nifedipine, labetalol, methyldopa) 
(Figure 12C) showed they had similar efficacy in lowering BP in severe 
hypertension in pregnancy, with nifedipine showing superiority in some 
studies (see Section 5.2.6).43,253,254,611,615 Nifedipine also has the advantage of wider distribution, availability, and lower pricing. Available data 
showed that hydralazine is less effective than other drugs and is associated with more side effects.616 Hydralazine is therefore a second-line 
option to be used only if other drugs are not available. 
In cases of pre-eclampsia with severe features, persistent severe 
hypertension, or recurrent severe hypertension despite orally administered agents, i.v. administration of labetalol (or nicardipine) is advised. Intravenous urapidil can also be used but may not be available 
in all countries.611,617,618 Sodium nitroprusside is the drug of last resort because prolonged treatment is associated with an increased 
risk of foetal cyanide poisoning.619 The drug of choice when 
pre-eclampsia is associated with pulmonary oedema is nitroglycerine 
(glyceryl trinitrate), given as an i.v. infusion of 5 μg/min, gradually 
increasing every 3–5 min to a maximum dose of 100 μg/min, in combination with diuretics.43,611 
12.3.4. Hypertension and delivery 
A recent randomized controlled trial from the United Kingdom found 
that once a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia was made in women with late 
pre-term pre-eclampsia (34–37 weeks), there was a lower rate of maternal morbidity and less severe maternal hypertension when delivery 
was planned to occur within the next 48 h.620 However, a greater proportion of neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit 
compared to mothers who were managed from an earlier stage. 
Decisions around timing of delivery should be individualized considering 
both maternal and foetal well-being. If well managed hypertension 
alone, delivery should be planned around 39 weeks of gestation. 
When choosing the mode of delivery, the clinical scenario should 
take into consideration the current gestational age and a full foetal assessment, as well as the preference of the mother. If induction of labour is to be considered, continuous foetal monitoring is required. 
Women with severe pre-eclampsia benefit from neuraxial anaesthesia 
to reduce the hypertensive response to pain. Additionally, an epidural 
will provide adequate anaesthesia should a caesarean delivery be 
required. 
After delivery, methyldopa should be avoided due to the risk of 
post-partum depression. Methyldopa should be stopped within 2 
days after delivery and changed to an alternative treatment.

12.4. Arrhythmias 
The number of pregnant women presenting with arrhythmia is rising 
due to increasing age at pregnancy and cardiovascular risk factors 
such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and CAD in pregnant women.630 Haemodynamic, metabolic, and hormonal changes, and 
changes in autonomic function may contribute to increased arrhythmogenesis during pregnancy and women with prior history of arrhythmia 
may experience worsening of symptoms during pregnancy 
(Figure 13).630 Arrhythmia may have serious effects on the health of 
both the mother and the foetus and should be treated similarly to arrhythmias in non-pregnant women. 
12.4.1. Supraventricular arrhythmias 
12.4.1.1. New-onset narrow QRS tachycardia  
New-onset narrow QRS (<120 ms) tachycardias in pregnancy are 
treated according to haemodynamic stability. In all cases with 
haemodynamic instability caused by any supraventricular tachycardia 
(SVT) including AF and AFL, synchronized, direct current cardioversion is indicated (Figure 14).631 The foetal heart rate should be closely 
monitored after cardioversion.632 In haemodynamically stable narrow QRS tachycardias, the use of vagal manoeuvres (modified 
Valsalva manoeuvre, carotid sinus massage) may terminate an atrioventricular (nodal) re-entry tachycardia (AV(N)RT) arrhythmia.633

If these manoeuvres fail, i.v. adenosine (6–18 mg bolus) is recommended for termination of AV(N)RT. Intravenous beta-1-selective 
blockers (preferably metoprolol) can be administered for all SVTs, 
which either terminate the SVT or slow AV conduction and thereby 
the ventricular rate.634 Intravenous beta-1-selective blockers (metoprolol), non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil), and digoxin can be 
used safely.635 In stable patients without structural heart disease, flecainide and ibutilide may be considered for termination of AF and 
AFL (Figure 15). In patients with congenital disease, synchronized, 
direct current cardioversion may be preferred. 
12.4.1.2. Atrial fibrillation including anticoagulation 
The incidence of arrhythmias among pregnant women is increasing, 
with AF being the most clinically relevant.252,271,636 Atrial enlargement 
during pregnancy is accompanied by increased atrial function and both 
size and function of the left atrium reverse after normal pregnancy.637 
Atrial fibrillation is more frequent in pregnant women at older age, with 
high BMI638, with ACHD, or with predisposing acquired conditions (e.g. 
hypertension, HF).637 Compared to women <25 years of age, the 
odds ratio (OR) of AF episodes was 5.2 in women aged ≥40, and the 
OR was higher in the third compared to the first trimester.638 Rapid 
atrioventricular conduction of AF may have serious haemodynamic 
consequences for both mother and foetus. Atrial fibrillation during 
pregnancy is associated with increased maternal death.639 Atrial flutter 
in pregnant women most often occurs in the presence of ACHD or 
valvular heart disease (VHD) and in metabolic disturbances such as 
thyrotoxicosis or electrolyte disturbances. 
Direct current cardioversion in pregnancy is required in haemodynamically unstable patients with monitoring of foetal heart rate 
(Figure 15).250,268,271 Rhythm control is the preferred AF treatment 
strategy during pregnancy. For women with structurally normal hearts, 
anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g. flecainide and sotalol, see Section 5.2.5) are 
not associated with foetal harm, although sotalol’s beta-blocker effect 
necessitates monitoring of foetal growth.250,268,271 There are minimal 
data on the use of propafenone during pregnancy, but this sodium channel blocker may be considered if flecainide is not available. Intravenous 
ibutilide or flecainide may be considered for termination of AFL and AF 
in haemodynamically stable patients.640 
The indication for anticoagulation with LMWH before cardioversion 
or the need for transoesophageal echocardiography should be evaluated as in non-pregnant women and be maintained for at least 4 weeks 
after cardioversion.636,641

When a rate control strategy is needed in the case of (long-standing) 
persistent or permanent AF, beta-blockers, verapamil, or digoxin 
should be used, also in combination, taking into consideration the concomitant conditions affecting the mother.271,642 
Atrial fibrillation is a strong risk factor for cardioembolic events, 
and the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy may increase this risk. In 
pregnant women with persistent or permanent AF, the decision to anticoagulate is the same as in non-pregnant women and depends on the 
risk of thromboembolic events according to the CHA2DS2-VA score 
[congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 (doubled), diabetes, 
stroke (doubled), vascular disease, age 65–74].643 The CHA2DS2-VA 
score threshold of ≥2 to anticoagulate has not been validated in 
pregnancy.643,644 DOACs are contraindicated in pregnancy. The presence of mechanical valves or moderate to severe mitral stenosis require 
VKA (see Section 5.2.1 and Section 12.5). 
12.4.1.3. Pre-existing supraventricular tachycardia 
In women with AVNRT, atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT), 
and focal atrial tachycardia (FAT), chronic oral prophylaxis can be 
achieved with beta-blockers (metoprolol) or verapamil. For women 
with drug-refractory SVT or who have a contraindication to these 
drugs, flecainide or sotalol are reasonable alternatives, as is propafenone if flecainide is not available.

In pregnant women with AVRT and Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) 
syndrome, arrhythmia episodes can be prevented by using oral flecainide, 
or propafenone when flecainide is not available. When AV-nodal blocking 
agents are used in WPW syndrome and AF occurs, the risk of rapid ventricular rates is increased. However, in pregnant women without documented AF, with known orthodromic AVRT, and with intermittent 
pre-excitation, long-term AV blockade is acceptable for prevention. 
If catheter ablation treatment is necessary, it should be performed by 
experienced operators in a centre equipped with non-fluoroscopic 
mapping techniques (Section 12.4.3.2). 
12.4.2. Ventricular arrhythmias 
New-onset VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arising during pregnancy 
are rare (18 per 100 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations).652 The 
most common type of VT in pregnant women is idiopathic VT originating 
from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) (Figure 16). When new- 
onset VT develops during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy or during the first 
month post-partum, underlying PPCM should be excluded.370 
The use of amiodarone is not recommended in pregnancy and 
should be limited to women with refractory or life-threatening arrhythmias that cannot be controlled with any other anti-arrhythmic therapy. 
If administered, it requires close monitoring for potential side effects in 
the foetus, such as bradycardia or IUGR. 
In women with known underlying substrates for VT, beta-blockers 
are recommended for prevention of VT.148,252 In case of refractoriness 
or contraindications to beta-blockers, anti-arrhythmic therapy with flecainide, sotalol, or quinidine is recommended, with the choice of drug 
based on the underlying cardiac substrate (Figure 16).148,252 Idiopathic 
RVOT-VT can be prevented with beta-blockers or verapamil.653 
When this is ineffective, flecainide654 or sotalol650,655–659 are safe options to consider for prophylaxis of idiopathic RVOT-VT. 
Recommendations on the acute management of ventricular arrhythmias during pregnancy are described in the 2022 ESC Guidelines for the 
management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death, and are depicted in Figure 16.252 
12.4.3. Cardioversion, ablation, and device 
implantation, and implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator management 
12.4.3.1. Electrical cardioversion 
Electrical cardioversion is safe and effective in all pregnancy phases as it 
does not affect foetal circulation or induce foetal arrhythmia. In pregnancy there are no changes in transthoracic impedance compared to 
non-pregnant women,660 and shock energies delivered should therefore be the same as in non-pregnant patients. The foetal heart rate 
should be monitored after cardioversion.631,632,661,662

Catheter ablation in pregnant women should preferably be performed 
after the first trimester in a centre with experience in non-fluoroscopic

Section 4.3.5) or with non-fluoroscopic imaging techniques.669 
Women with an ICD should maintain their regular ICD care throughout pregnancy.669 
12.4.3.4. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator management 
Routine ICD interrogation and guidance are recommended prior to delivery. Management of pregnant women with an ICD or pacemaker is 
summarized in Figures 17 and 18. 
Women with structural heart disease are at higher risk of atrial and 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias during pregnancy.670 Consequently, pregnant women with ICDs may present with either an inappropriate shock 
(due to e.g. lead defects, new-onset supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, 
or technical issues such as T-wave oversensing or noise sensing) or an 
appropriate ICD shock caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In case 
of tachyarrhythmia, triggering events such as HF, electrolyte abnormalities, ischaemia, or infectious disease should be ruled out, as with non- 
pregnant women. Depending on the underlying cause, therapy consists 
of device reprogramming or initiating or adapting anti-arrhythmic drug 
therapy. In the case of drug-refractory arrhythmias or serious anti- 
arrhythmic drug side effects, catheter ablation may be considered in experienced centres.664 
Most data indicate that maternal ICD shocks do not have major foetal adverse effects.668,671 The approach to pregnant women presenting 
with ICD shocks is no different from non-pregnant women 
(Figure 18).252 
A WCD may be considered when pregnant women have an ICD indication from reversible conditions.365,672–674

12.4.4. Cardiac arrest 
Maternal cardiac arrest occurs in 8/100 000 hospitalizations in the United 
States of America679 and 7.6/100 000 pregnancies in the Netherlands.680 
Haemorrhage and anaesthetic complications are the most common 
overall causes of cardiac arrest,681 and HF, ACS, arrhythmias, aortic dissection, and PE are the most common cardiovascular causes of cardiac 
arrest.682,683 
Because most of the underlying causes of cardiac arrest in pregnancy 
tend to be reversible, pregnant women have better outcomes than non- 
pregnant women.684 Basic cardiac arrest resuscitation principles apply 
to pregnant women, although some differences should be considered.684 If cardiac arrest occurs beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy, left lateral manual displacement of the uterus or left lateral position of the 
woman is indicated to avoid aortocaval compression (Figure 19).684,685 
Chest compressions should be according to basic life support guidelines.

In post-arrest care, the full left lateral decubitus position is recommended. The use of device-assisted chest compressions in pregnancy 
is currently not recommended due to lack of data.684 Importantly, no 
drugs should be withheld because of concerns about teratogenicity.614,686 Foetal monitoring after cardiac arrest is mandatory. 
Emergency caesarean section should be immediately prepared for 
and considered when initial resuscitation fails.682 If this is not feasible, 
rapid maternal transfer is advised to an appropriate clinical setting 
with uninterrupted resuscitation. 
12.4.5. Bradycardia 
12.4.5.1. Sinus node dysfunction 
Sinus bradycardia due to sinus node dysfunction is uncommon in 
pregnant women who do not have structural heart disease. In 
the second trimester, symptomatic bradycardia may occur as a result of a reduction in systemic resistance, but this rarely requires 
treatment. Symptomatic bradycardia during pregnancy may be 
caused by the supine hypotensive syndrome, defined as a systolic 
BP decrease of >15 mmHg due to compression of the inferior 
vena cava by the uterus.690 Management depends on the underlying 
cause, severity of symptoms, and potential risks to both the mother 
and the foetus. 
12.4.5.2. Atrioventricular block 
Mobitz type I AV block is common in pregnant women and rarely 
progresses during pregnancy.691 There are no data on progression 
of congenital AV conduction block during pregnancy and vaginal 
delivery does not cause extra risk for mothers who are asymptomatic, haemodynamically stable, and have a normal cardiac anatomy and function.691 Prophylactic placement of temporary 
pacemaker wires is not usually indicated but is an individualized 
decision. 
12.4.5.3. Management of sinus node dysfunction and 
atrioventricular block 
In acute, life-threatening settings, bradycardia should be treated as in 
non-pregnancy. Isoproterenol can be used when benefits outweigh 
risks. It is not known if it is excreted in human milk. Pacing indications 
(temporary and permanent) do not differ between pregnant and 
non-pregnant women and can be found in the 2021 ESC 
Guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy.692 Pacemakers can be implanted safely during pregnancy using 
standard methods with minimal fluoroscopy or non-fluoroscopic 
methods.675,693–695 
12.5. Valvular heart disease 
During childbearing years VHD is usually either congenital or rheumatic 
in cause. Complications during pregnancy include new-onset AF, which 
can lead to deterioration in cardiac function, an increased risk of 
thromboembolic events, and heart failure.696,697 Women with valve 
disease should have access to pre-conception counselling and their cardiac condition should be optimized. This may include pre-pregnancy 
intervention or surgery for those with symptoms or severe disease 
(Figure 20), in keeping with the 2021 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the 
management of valvular heart disease.698 Dedicated tools for risk stratification may be needed in the setting of rheumatic heart disease.697 
12.5.1. Stenotic native valve lesions 
Stenotic valve lesions limit the ability to increase CO during pregnancy. 
The result of this may be presentation with symptoms for the first time 
during pregnancy. Serial TTE in pregnancy will usually demonstrate an 
increase in valve gradient of up to 50% due to the normal 
pregnancy-related increase in CO.699

12.5.1.1. Mitral valve stenosis 
Mitral valve stenosis is a common cause of HF during pregnancy.11 Mild 
stenosis is usually well tolerated.11 However, symptoms may occur if 
the valve area is <1.5 cm2. Maternal mortality in mitral stenosis is higher 
in those with NYHA >II, systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) 
>30 mmHg, severe stenosis, older age, and in low-income countries11,696,700 (Figure 20). Foetal risks include increased rates of premature delivery, IUGR, and foetal death, especially in highly symptomatic 
mothers (NYHA III/IV).701 
12.5.1.1.1. Management. Diagnosis is as per usual criteria.698 
During pregnancy, valve area by 2D-planimetry is thought to be 
more reliable than flow-dependent measures, because higher stroke 
volume and tachycardia will increase the measured gradient across 
the valve.702 Mitral valve anatomy, especially the presence of subvalvar involvement or the presence of MR, is important if considering 
intervention. 
If signs or symptoms of PH are present, activity restriction should be 
suggested, and beta-blockers and/or diuretics should be started. 
Anticoagulation regimens should be individualized. Therapeutic anticoagulation with full therapeutic-dose LMWH or VKA (see Section 5) 
is indicated in those with AF, left atrial clot, or a previous embolism. 
Anticoagulation should be considered in those with significant mitral 
stenosis, spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium, dilated left atrium with left atrial volume index >60 mL/mL2, or those in HF. 
12.5.1.1.2. Interventions. Pre-pregnancy intervention should be considered in those with significant stenosis (valve area <1.5 cm2). Before 
and during pregnancy, percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy is 
the primary intervention in those who remain in NYHA III/IV or with 
severe PAP elevation despite medical therapy.703 Balloon techniques 
are highly successful during pregnancy unless there is complex subvalvar 
involvement. Closed commissurotomy is rarely used but is an alternative. Open valve surgery should only be used when there is a risk to maternal life and other options are not possible or have failed.704 
12.5.1.1.3. Delivery. Vaginal delivery is the preferred option. 
Caesarean section is preferred in cases of severe mitral stenosis and 
for those with refractory HF. Delivery is a time of increased risk of 
HF and thrombotic events.182 
12.5.1.1.4. Post-partum. Close monitoring is needed in the days following delivery and diuretics may be required to treat fluid overload. The long- 
term outcome depends on the risk of valve progression and the success of 
commissurotomy if performed. Lifelong follow-up is required. 
12.5.1.2. Valvular aortic stenosis 
Bicuspid aortic valve disease is a common cause of valvular aortic stenosis in 
women of childbearing age. The outcome is related to the baseline severity 
of the stenotic lesion. Women with severe stenosis and those with symptoms prior to pregnancy have a 1 in 4 risk of developing HF during pregnancy.703 Exercise testing and measurement of NP can be used to 
stratify risk prior to pregnancy. Those with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis should be offered intervention prior to pregnancy. Risk-stratifying 
those with asymptomatic aortic stenosis is more challenging. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or effort limitation on exercise testing, indicate that 
intervention before pregnancy should be considered.698 
Women with severe aortic stenosis contemplating pregnancy should 
be counselled regarding the risks and offered surgery if they prefer. 
Despite this, maternal mortality is rare for those under expert 
care.703 The risk of sudden death in those with severe stenosis is increased but difficult to quantify. BAV-associated aortopathy is discussed in Section 8.3. 
12.5.1.2.1. Management. Medical therapy has a limited role in 
symptomatic aortic stenosis. Diuretics may help those with HF or 
high filling pressures, but caution should be exercised. In women 
with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, rest and possibly hospital admission should be considered. Intervention should be considered in 
women with persisting symptoms including angina or with new ST 
changes on ECG. In symptomatic pregnant women with severe aortic 
stenosis not responding to medical therapy, non-surgical options such 
as balloon valvuloplasty or transcatheter aortic valve implantation 
(TAVI) may be considered during pregnancy.705,706 Procedures 
should be performed in an experienced valve centre. If no catheter- 
based options are available, surgical valve replacement or repair is recommended. If the foetus is at a viable gestation, taking account of 
other comorbidities and the available level of neonatal care, delivery 
should occur prior to valve intervention. These complex decisions 
should be discussed with the full Pregnancy Heart Team.707 Cardiac 
surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with at least a 
20% risk of foetal loss.708 
Vaginal delivery is the preferred mode of delivery for the majority of 
women. In those with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, caesarean 
delivery should be considered. Early post-partum HF may develop. 
For pulmonary stenosis, see Section 9 on congenital heart disease. 
12.5.2. Regurgitant native valve lesions 
Valve regurgitation is generally better tolerated than valve stenosis in 
pregnancy. Increased maternal and foetal event rates can be seen in 
those with severe regurgitation.709 
12.5.2.1. Mitral and aortic valve regurgitation 
Women with valve regurgitation and either symptoms or LV 
dysfunction incur an increased risk of HF, occurring in 20%–25% 
of those with at least moderate regurgitation.182,710 Acute regurgitant 
lesions are often less well tolerated than chronic regurgitation.710 
12.5.2.1.1. Management. Diuretics can be used in those with severe 
symptomatic mitral or aortic regurgitation. Cardiac surgery is rarely required during pregnancy. Vaginal delivery is preferred unless the 
mother is in refractory HF. 
12.5.2.2. Arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse 
Arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse (AMVP) is defined as the presence of 
mitral valve prolapse and arrhythmia symptoms or signs, such as frequent ventricular premature contractions or complex ventricular arrhythmias.711 The arrhythmias may arise from myocardial fibrosis 
resulting from prolonged and increased stretch of papillary muscles 
and of the inferolateral LV wall by the prolapsing valves. 
Several reports have included female sex as a risk factor for severe 
arrhythmic events.711 Other risk factors include syncope, the presence of mitral annular disjunction, late gadolinium enhancement 
on CMR, complex ventricular arrhythmias, including non-sustained 
ventricular tachycardia, syncope, T-wave inversions in the inferolateral ECG leads, bi-leaflet mitral valve prolapse, and reduced LVEF. 
Little is known about the effect of pregnancy in women with AMVP, 
but altered loading conditions may lead to increased tension in mitral

valve apparatus and thereby increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. 
A recent publication indicated increased arrhythmic risk during pregnancy in women with AMVP and life-threatening ventricular 
arrhythmias.712 
It is recommended that women with AMVP undergo pre-conception 
counselling and optimization of medication. Medical treatment includes 
anti-arrhythmic therapy with, for example, beta-blockers and/or flecainide.713 If started pre-pregnancy, treatment should continue during pregnancy with close follow-up and arrhythmic monitoring. A pregnant 
woman with AMVP should be monitored during pregnancy at a tertiary 
centre with experience in AMVP and with periodic Holter monitoring 
to identify a potential increase in arrhythmic burden.711 Risk stratification 
for ICD implantation should follow the consensus for AMVP in general.711 
12.5.2.3. Tricuspid regurgitation 
Medical treatment for tricuspid regurgitation is usually not required 
but during pregnancy diuretics and medication for rhythm management may be needed. Surgery for isolated TR in pregnancy is rarely 
indicated except for the setting of endocarditis.

12.5.3. Prosthetic valves 
When a woman of childbearing age or a girl requires valve surgery, 
careful consideration should be given to the possibility of future pregnancies. When appropriate, the discussion regarding valve choice 
should involve the Pregnancy Heart Team. In general, valve repair, 
valve-in-valve, or non-mechanical valves are preferable, avoiding the 
need for anticoagulation. Data from the ROPAC III study, focusing 
on prosthetic valves, show that the chance of an uncomplicated pregnancy with a live birth in women with a MHV was 54%, compared to 
79% in women with a tissue valve.177 Regional differences, especially between high-income and low- and middle-income countries, need to be 
acknowledged, as also indicated in a recent study from Madras in India 
(M-PAC registry) describing pregnancy outcomes in 70 women with a 
prosthetic heart valve.717 A very high foetal death rate and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) rate (40% and 34%, respectively),717 including a high number of valve thromboses, is believed to 
relate not only to differences in organization of care, but also to underlying valvular disease, with more rheumatic heart disease in low- and 
middle-income countries. The Ross procedure in aortic valve disease 
is an alternative option to be considered. In the absence of aortic dilatation, pregnancy risk is low after the Ross procedure.718 
12.5.3.1. Bioprosthetic valves 
Prior to pregnancy, a full assessment of valve function should be 
performed. Many women are on lifetime low-dose aspirin treatment, 
and this should be continued during pregnancy unless there is a contraindication. If there is severe valve dysfunction prior to pregnancy, 
reintervention should be considered. However, in this setting 
the risk of pregnancy with the current valve dysfunction should be balanced against the risk of the new valve being proposed. Mechanical 
valve implantation should be avoided when possible. Transcatheter 
valve-in-valve intervention may have a role in extending the lifespan 
of a failing bioprosthetic valve in a young woman contemplating pregnancy. In a recent retrospective study of CARPREG data, 215 pregnancies in 101 women who had implanted bioprosthetic valves prior to 
pregnancy were described. More than a quarter had some degree of 
valvar dysfunction, although the time since the last valve replacement 
surgery was only 6 ± 3 years on average. Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction was more than twice as common in women with left-sided as opposed to right-sided valves.719 
The chance of a pregnancy without serious adverse events and a live 
birth in women with a bioprosthetic valve is 79%.177 When significant 
bioprosthetic dysfunction is present, the risk of complications can be 
significant, especially if associated with severe stenosis or ventricular 
dysfunction. There is no compelling evidence that pregnancy is associated with accelerated valve deterioration. 
12.5.3.2. Mechanical valves 
Pregnant women with MHVs are exposed to a high risk of complications (mWHO 2.0 risk classification ≥III). The chances of an event-free 
pregnancy with a live birth were only 58% in the initial ROPAC II study 
and showed no improvement after 8 years in the ROPAC III study 
(54%).177,204 Thrombotic complications occur in 9%–24% and bleeding 
complications in 20%–30% of the cases in the ROPAC III and a United 
Kingdom study, respectively.176,177 Women with a mechanical valve in 
the mitral position are especially at risk of adverse outcomes, including 
mortality.177 
All women with MHVs should be fully counselled pre-pregnancy regarding the risks and benefits of the various anticoagulation regimens. 
When planning the optimal anticoagulation strategy, logistical issues,

such as access to timely anti-factor Xa level testing and maternal ability to 
adhere to treatment regimens, need to be considered. 
12.5.3.2.1. Anticoagulation during pregnancy. The most effective 
regimen in preventing maternal thrombotic complications is the continuous use of VKAs. Thrombotic events not only compromise the 
mother but also jeopardize the baby.170,200,204,206,720,721 However, 
there remain concerns about the foetal impact of VKAs. Data from 
the ROPAC III study indicated a higher risk of miscarriage in VKA 
users.177 As discussed in Section 5, the foetal risk of VKAs is in part 
dose-related. Although there is no safe dose for the foetus, event rates 
are reduced when lower doses of VKA are used.200 For these reasons, 
continuation of VKAs should be considered when the risk of thrombosis is high and the dose required to achieve the target INR is low 
(see Section 5). Target INRs are unchanged from non-pregnant values.698 INR monitoring should be weekly or every 2 weeks (see 
Section 5). 
The alternative strategy is switching to therapeutic-dose LMWH 
(twice daily) until the 12th week of pregnancy with a monitoring 
plan. The target peak levels of anti-factor Xa should be discussed individually and vary between 1 and 1.2 IU/mL. The value of trough anti- 
factor Xa levels is less clear. Adjusting dosing to obtain levels of 
>0.6 IU/mL has been suggested, however, with little evidence.170,216 
Dosing regimens for therapeutic LMWH are provided in Section 5. 
In women with a very high thrombotic risk, the addition of low-dose 
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) should be considered.170 In rare circumstances, such as the unavailability of anti-factor Xa level testing, i.v. 
UFH can be used. Target aPTT levels with a prolongation of ≥2 times 
the control can be challenging to achieve and may require multiple adjustments of dosing and prolonged inpatient care. In the majority of 
cases, VKAs will be the favoured therapy in the second and third trimesters to minimize the maternal risks after the period of embryogenesis.176,204 Despite this, some women will choose to remain on 
therapeutic-dose LMWH throughout pregnancy. The management 
of anticoagulants during pregnancy in women with MHVs is summarized in Figure 21. 
12.5.3.2.2. Mechanical valve thrombosis. Regular maternal cardiac 
ultrasound should be performed during pregnancy to assess valve function and rule out valve thrombosis. Imaging once per trimester will usually suffice unless there is pre-existing valve dysfunction or HF. Changes 
in valve gradient that exceed the usual increase due to changing cardiac 
output should be investigated. Symptoms such as new HF, embolic 
event, or syncope need urgent assessment. Changes in valve clicks 
and new murmurs should also trigger investigation. Transthoracic and 
transoesophageal echocardiography, fluoroscopy, and CT can all be 
used to assess MHV leaflet movement. 
Valve thrombosis has a high maternal mortality. Its management is 
comparable with management in non-pregnant women. In a subacute 
setting, optimizing anticoagulation with UFH and re-establishing a 
therapeutic INR with VKA may be sufficient. Thrombolysis may be considered, especially in non-critically ill women, when surgery is not immediately available for critically ill women, and in right-sided prosthetic 
valve thrombosis.698 Urgent intervention is often required in acute 
thrombosis with obstruction or severe regurgitation.722 This is associated with high maternal and foetal risks. There is a clear survival benefit for the foetus without increasing maternal mortality if cardiac 
surgery is performed after caesarean section. Therefore, the optimal 
treatment strategy, as determined by the Pregnancy Heart Team, will 
depend on type of valve involved, haemodynamic stability of the 
mother, and gestational age.421 
12.5.3.2.3. Anticoagulation during delivery in women with mechanical heart valves. The management of delivery for women with 
MHV is discussed in Section 4.5.6. These are high-risk deliveries with significant bleeding complications.

12.5.4. Endocarditis prophylaxis 
Infective endocarditis during pregnancy is a rare yet severe event associated with maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. An increasing risk factor is represented by i.v. drug abuse associated with the 
opioid epidemic in the United States of America.723 The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus (74%) and Serratia (13%).724 A recent comparison across antepartum, delivery, and post-partum 
maternity-associated infective endocarditis showed the 60-day mortality rate was highest in the delivery subgroup and the rate of valve 
replacements was highest in post-partum cases.725 Antibiotics should 
be given according to guidelines,178,726 laboratory data on culture and 
antibiotic sensitivity, and the differential foetal toxicity of antibiotics 
(see Section 5). 
12.6. Heart failure 
12.6.1. Chronic heart failure 
Heart failure complicates 11% of pregnancies in women with pre-existing 
heart disease and has an in-hospital maternal mortality rate of 9%.2 
Specific pre-pregnancy counselling is needed for women with ventricular 
dysfunction irrespective of the cause. As many HF medications are contraindicated in pregnancy (see Section 5), modifying the drug regimen pre- 
pregnancy should be part of pregnancy risk stratification, with reassessment 
after at least 3 months.727 Contractile reserve off HF therapy, measured by 
stress echocardiography, can be used for reassessing ventricular function.371 
Two peaks of HF deterioration occur in pregnancy: at 23–30 weeks and 
peri-delivery.182 Pre-conception counselling should include a discussion of 
management if there is a clinical deterioration during the first peak. Early delivery due to maternal cardiac deterioration will impact foetal outcomes. 
Patients with mild ventricular dysfunction may tolerate pregnancy with 
no increase in symptoms. However, those with worse than mild ventricular dysfunction (mWHO 2.0 class >II) (Table 6) require expert care from 
the Pregnancy Heart Team, with additional input from the advanced HF 
team including transplant and mechanical circulatory support experts. 
Women with pre-existing severe HF (LVEF <30%, mWHO 2.0 class 
IV) are at high risk of maternal morbidity and mortality and account for 
up to 15% of maternal deaths globally.2,728 
Assessment of patients with pre-existing HF includes regular assessment of symptoms, echocardiography, and NP at intervals determined 
by the severity of HF and other non-cardiac issues. 
12.6.2. Acute heart failure (including cardiogenic shock) 
Acute heart failure can develop in women without pre-existing heart 
disease as can be the case in PPCM (Section 7), or secondary in women 
with known cardiac disease such as cardiomyopathy, ischaemic heart 
disease, ACHD, and severe VHD. The diagnosis can be challenging because the symptoms and signs of AHF can be misinterpreted as changes 
due to pregnancy (Figure 22).349,729 Pregnant women presenting with 
AHF require urgent hospital admission. These patients should be referred to an expert centre with established advanced HF care, including 
on-site surgery and mechanical circulatory support or even a transplant 
programme as backup. 
In case of cardiogenic shock, recommended inotropic agents include levosimendan,730 dobutamine, and milrinone (Figure 22). Levosimendan is 
administered as a continuous infusion without an initial loading dose. 
Dobutamine is an option, whereas adrenaline should be avoided. 
Milrinone may be an alternative if benefits outweigh the risk, due to 
placental transfer (see Supplementary data online, Table S2). Mechanical 
circulatory support [preferably veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (VA-ECMO)731] should be considered in case of severe 
refractory cardiogenic shock.339 In cardiogenic shock, urgent delivery by 
caesarean section with combined spinal/epidural analgesia or general anaesthesia is recommended.732–734 
Milder cases of acute HF can be treated with oral diuretics, 
b1-selective beta-blockers (bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate), hydralazine, and oral nitrates. Diuretics (loop diuretics and thiazides if required) should be used with caution due to a potential reduction in 
uterine blood flow, but may be necessary in pulmonary congestion 
or echocardiographic signs of high LV end-diastolic pressure.732

Beta-blockers should be initiated and gradually up-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose.345,357,732–734 ACE-Is, ARBs, ARNIs, MRAs, ivabradine, SGLT2 inhibitors, and atenolol are contraindicated during 
pregnancy due to adverse effects on the foetus. Hydralazine and nitrates appear safe.43,345,357,733,734 
In the post-partum period, the use of ivabradine to control the heart 
rate may be considered in addition to beta-blockers, or if there is a 
contraindication for beta-blockers.43,339,735,736 In HF with a reversible 
cause, HF treatment in accordance with guidelines should be recommended for at least 12 months after full LV recovery, followed by gradual tapering350 (see also Section 7). Women with pregnancy-associated 
HF should be counselled about the risks of recurrence in subsequent 
pregnancies.737 
12.7. Special populations 
12.7.1. Heart transplantation 
Successful pregnancies have been reported in women with heart 
transplantation, but these pregnancies carry a higher risk. Before 
transplantation and before a post-transplantation pregnancy, women should be counselled about maternal and foetal risks, including the risks of rejection, infection, graft dysfunction, and potential 
teratogenicity of drugs. Based on the individual risk factors, it is 
recommended to postpone pregnancy until at least 1 year after 
transplantation.275 Women with heart transplantation are at 
higher risk of experiencing cardiometabolic complications during 
pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, hypertension, decreased kidney function, and infections.741–745 The risk 
of complications is lower in women with normal graft function 
and no signs of rejection. Pre-pregnancy evaluation should include 
standard assessments and, if clinically indicated, coronary angiography, right-heart catheterization, and endomyocardial biopsy.741–745 
All drugs should be reviewed before pregnancy275 and mycophenolic acid therapy275,741 should be avoided due to the teratogenic risk. In 
cases where the father has the same human leucocyte antigen (HLA) 
as the donated heart, there is a risk of developing donor-specific antibodies.746,747 Therefore, consideration should be given to performing 
paternal HLA testing before conception. 
During pregnancy, changes in maternal metabolism can affect the 
serum drug levels of immunosuppression therapy.748 Close monitoring 
of serum drug levels is recommended.275 Echocardiographic evaluations are recommended to assess graft function during pregnancy. 
Foetal growth should be regularly evaluated due to the risk of lower 
birth weight.745 Vaginal delivery should be considered in stable 
patients.745 
Close monitoring of cardiac function, immunosuppression, 
and donor-specific antibodies is necessary until 6–12 months after 
delivery due to the risk of post-pregnancy rejection.275,741,749–751 
Lactation may be possible in patients on immunosuppressive drugs, 
depending on the type of medication (see Section 5.2.10). 
12.7.2. Cardio-oncology 
12.7.2.1 Gestational cancer 
Gestational cancer is defined as cancer that occurs during pregnancy or 
within 12 months after delivery. The occurrence is ∼1 in 1000 pregnancies, with a possible rise in incidence as maternal childbearing age increases. The most frequent cancers affecting pregnant women are 
breast cancer, cervical and ovarian cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia, colorectal cancer, and melanoma.752–754 Women diagnosed with cancer 
during pregnancy should be evaluated and considered by a multidisciplinary team. Both the effect of pregnancy on the cancer and the effect of 
the cancer on the pregnancy should be evaluated. Patients should be 
followed in centres with neonatal units in case of premature delivery. 
The baseline assessment prior to chemotherapy, and the monthly or 
bimonthly follow-up during chemotherapy, should include clinical history, 
physical examination, ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and TTE in the context of 
physiological haemodynamic changes during pregnancy.107,755,756 LVEF, 
NP serial measurements,756 and high-sensitivity cTn can be used for monitoring of cancer-therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD).734,756 
Chemotherapy given during the first trimester is associated with a high 
risk of malformation (up to 20%) and miscarriage. Chemotherapy is often 
avoided after 34 weeks of gestation to provide a ≥3 week window between the last chemotherapy and delivery. Cytotoxic chemotherapies 
provide different risk profiles during the second and third trimesters.752,754 
The suggested chemotherapy treatments for pregnant women with cancer are summarized in the 2022 ESC Guidelines on cardio-oncology.757

###### 12.7.2.2 Pregnancy in cancer survivors

Improved cancer treatments have led to an increased number of women with pregnancies after oncological therapy. Previous treatment 
with anthracycline chemotherapy or chest radiotherapy implies a 
15-fold increased lifetime risk of developing HF. Furthermore, both 
the cancer and the cancer treatment have an impact on fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and cardiovascular health. The major risk factors for 
cardiovascular events during pregnancy in cancer survivors include 
CTRCD (28%; 47.4 times higher odds), younger age at cancer diagnosis,758,759 higher cumulative doses of anthracycline, and greater duration between cancer treatment and first pregnancy.758,759 
13. Adverse pregnancy outcomes 
and long-term management 
Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including gestational hypertensive disorders, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), 
small or large for gestational age babies, or pre-term birth are a group 
of interrelated disorders that share common pathways.760 Placental 
dysfunction and oxidative stress in the context of cardiometabolic, genetic, or environmental risk factors may cause APOs.761 A multidisciplinary care approach is essential (Figure 23)761,762 for optimizing 
modifiable cardiovascular risk factors after all APOs.761,762 
13.1. Adverse pregnancy outcomes 
13.1.1. Post-partum hypertensive disorders 
Hypertension in the post-partum period is most common in women 
with antenatal hypertensive disorders, but it can also develop de novo 
in the post-partum period. New-onset or de novo post-partum pre- 
eclampsia is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in the post-partum period (Figure 24).763 
Women with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, most notably pre-eclampsia, have a higher incidence of several CVDs, including 
CAD, stroke, and HF.762,764 Treatment for uncomplicated post-partum 
hypertension (first 6 weeks after delivery) includes nifedipine and labetalol (metoprolol if labetalol is unavailable).764 A small randomized controlled trial showed that administration of furosemide in the first 5 days 
post-partum in women with gestational hypertension and pre- 
eclampsia significantly reduced the prevalence of persistently elevated 
BP at 7 days.765 Methyldopa should be avoided because of the risk of 
post-partum depression.602,766 Agents used for the management of 
acute, severe hypertension in the post-partum period are similar to 
those used during pregnancy and include labetalol, hydralazine, and nifedipine (see Sections 5 and 12).767 For women with persistent hypertension, antihypertensive therapy should be initiated with reference to 
lactating status following current guidelines (see Section 5).584,585,767 
13.1.2. Gestational diabetes mellitus 
Gestational diabetes mellitus is characterized by glucose intolerance 
that is first recognized during pregnancy.768 Haemoglobin A1c testing 
may help to identify women at high risk.768,769 Women with GDM 
have a sharply increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life 
and a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing adverse cardiovascular events.770–772 Women with GDM are recommended to undergo 
a formal oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) 6–12 weeks post-partum 
with a repeat assessment at 6–12 months (Figure 25). Thereafter, regular annual follow-up with glucose tolerance monitoring is recommended.773–775 
13.1.3. Pre-term birth 
Pre-term delivery occurs after 20 and before the completion of 37 
weeks of gestation, regardless of birth weight. There are strong associations between pre-term delivery (alone or with pregnancy-related 
hypertensive disorders), CVD, and mortality.771,772 Women with pre- 
term deliveries are more likely to have an increasing BP trajectory after 
pregnancy and to be affected by accelerated atherosclerosis independent of traditional CVD risk factors.776,777 The earlier pre-term delivery 
occurs, the more strongly it is associated with hypertension and CVD in 
later life. The relationship of pre-term birth to type 2 diabetes mellitus 
and dyslipidaemia is inconsistent. 
13.1.4. Small for gestational age 
Delivering a SGA baby (weight <10th percentile) has not been consistently related to an increased CVD risk, but has been associated with 
hypertension and diabetes.761,771,772 Conversely, large for gestational 
age babies (weight >90th percentile) have been reported to increase 
maternal CVD risk, but the evidence is limited.761 
13.1.5. Pregnancy loss and placental abruption 
Placental abruption, spontaneous pregnancy loss or stillbirth, and foetal 
loss after 28 weeks of gestation have been associated with an increased 
risk of future CVD, with a particularly high risk of hypertension and type 
2 diabetes mellitus.771,778 One or more terminations are associated 
with a higher CVD risk, however, with limited evidence.779 
13.2. Breastfeeding 
Breastfeeding fosters the recovery of maternal physiological systems to their 
pre-conception state. Breastfeeding women have a better cardiometabolic 
profile, and breastfeeding up to 12 months after childbirth has been shown 
to lower future risk of CVD and mortality,780–783 potentially due to lowered 
BP.784–787 Longer breastfeeding periods are associated with better CVD outcomes.782,784,788–790 The role of breastfeeding for women who experienced 
an APO is less clear, but it also appears to have beneficial effects.789,791,792 
There is inconclusive evidence about the beneficial effects of breastfeeding 
on the cardiovascular health of older women (i.e. aged ≥55 years).720,788,793,794

13.3. Women’s Heart Clinics 
Post-partum care is often segmented and only carried out by obstetricians. A longer duration of post-partum care, including cardiovascular risk assessment and counselling on CVD risk prevention, 
is likely to lower the long-term risk of CVD in women with an 
APO (Figure 25).762,795 Pregnancy Heart Teams and the potential 
establishment of Women’s Heart Clinics focusing on women of all 
ages with CVD are necessary to span the care up to post-partum.795 
Seamless communication between the various healthcare providers 
(e.g. obstetrician, cardiologist, internist, family physician) and multidisciplinary management of APOs is critical for long-term care and 
the woman’s future health.761,796,797

### 14 Key messages

• A Pregnancy Heart Team should be involved in the risk assessment, counselling and management of women in mWHO 2.0 
class ≥II–III from pre-conception to the late post-partum. 
Each woman should have a detailed delivery plan agreed in 
advance. 
• In women with known CVD, a complete clinical re-evaluation 
should take place pre-pregnancy to estimate risk, optimize treatment, consider and evaluate the removal of contraindicated drugs, 
and reduce the probability of complications. 
• Women and their partner (if any) should be offered structured 
psychosocial support during the entire trajectory, especially 
for those at high risk and those considering pregnancy 
termination. 
• Women with known heritable cardiovascular disorders should be 
counselled about the transmission risk, including the option for assisted reproductive technology. 
• Management of women with CVD who are pregnant or wishing 
to become pregnant should be individualized and performed according to a shared decision-making model, respecting the woman’s 
autonomy. 
• Women in mWHO 2.0 class IV should be comprehensively 
counselled about the very high pregnancy risk, being careful 
to promote a detailed and transparent dialogue about the 
heightened maternal and foetal risks associated with pregnancy. 
A shared decision-making process is essential, allowing for informed choices, including the consideration of pregnancy termination if necessary. 
• Vaginal delivery is the first choice for the majority of women with 
CVD. 
• In a life-threatening situation, treatments such as defibrillation, interventions, acute coronary revascularization, mechanical circulatory support, and medication should be the same as in 
non-pregnant women, irrespective of contraindications. 
• The use of non-invasive imaging tests with ionizing radiation during 
pregnancy should only be performed when the benefits clearly outweigh the maternal and foetal risk, and if the result will significantly 
modify the medical management. 
• In women with LQTS and CPVT, the continuation of beta-blockers 
throughout pregnancy with monitoring of foetal growth is recommended (atenolol is the only contraindicated beta-blocker). 
Beta-blockers of choice are propranolol and nadolol. 
• In women with LQT2, post-partum is a distinct high-risk period, 
and therefore full dosage of beta-blockers is strongly recommended. 
• Genetic testing should be considered in PPCM. 
• In women with PPCM and DCM, subsequent pregnancy is not recommended if LV function does not normalize. 
• Genetic testing in women with aortic disease wishing to conceive is 
recommended and management should be based on the presence 
and type of P/LP variant. 
• Women with the following ACHD lesions should be provided with 
expert counselling and education by a Pregnancy Heart Team, with 
clear and thorough discussion of the very high pregnancy risk and 
the need for a shared decision-making process: 
⚬Systemic RV, in NYHA class III–IV, ventricular dysfunction 
(EF <40%), more than moderate TR, or treated HF; 
⚬A Fontan circulation and oxygen saturation <85%, reduced ventricular function, severe arrhythmias, or in NYHA class III–IV. 
• There is no safe cut-off value for elevated pulmonary artery pressure in pregnancy.

• Any suspicion of VTE, including DVT and PE, requires an immediate 
formal assessment with validated diagnostic tests by a multidisciplinary specialized team. 
• LMWH is the agent of choice for prophylaxis and treatment of VTE 
in pregnancy. 
• When treating women with HF during pregnancy, it should be 
noted that several drugs [ACE-Is, ARBs, direct renin inhibitors, sacubitril–valsartan (ARNIs), MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors] are not recommended. When inotropes or more advanced treatment is 
necessary, referral to an expert centre is recommended. 
• When possible, mechanical valves should be avoided in girls and women of childbearing age. 
• Methyldopa, labetalol, and CCBs are recommended for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. 
• Women at high or moderate risk of pre-eclampsia should be advised to additionally take 75–100 mg of ASA daily from weeks 12 
to 36/37. 
• After cardiac transplantation, it is recommended to postpone pregnancy for at least 1 year, taking individual risk factors into account. 
• Women with APOs should be informed about long-term risks and 
preventive strategies and offered appropriate follow-up, including 
psychosocial support (if necessary).  
15. Gaps in evidence 
Pre-pregnancy counselling and evaluation 
• Data on the adverse effects of assisted reproductive treatment in 
women with CVD are lacking. 
Diagnostic methods 
• There is a lack of data on the safety of echocardiographic contrast 
agents during pregnancy or lactation. 
• There are controversial data on the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in pregnancy. 
• There are no clear cut-offs for NT-proBNP levels during pregnancy. 
• There are no normative values of cTnI and cTnT in pregnancy and 
the post-partum period. 
• There is a lack of data on normal lung ultrasound pattern during 
pregnancy. 
Drugs during pregnancy and lactation 
• Safety data of DOACs and antidotes (idarucizumab, andexanet alfa, 
cirapantag) in pregnancy are lacking. 
• Safety data of newer anti-arrhythmic drugs and rate-controlling 
drugs (vernakalant, ivabradine, landiolol) in pregnancy are lacking.  
Cardiomyopathy and primary arrhythmia syndromes 
• The available data on gene-specific management during pregnancy in 
different cardiomyopathies and primary arrhythmia syndromes are 
limited. 
Peripartum cardiomyopathy 
• The potential for recovery of cardiac function in PPCM remains unclear and the risks in subsequent pregnancies are not well defined. 
Aortopathies 
• More data are needed to correctly estimate the pregnancy risk in 
women with previous aortic dissection and/or aortic root surgery. 
• Risk factors for aortic dissection in the post-partum period are 
poorly understood, making counselling about this difficult. 
• It is unclear whether a distinction between root and ascending 
phenotype in women with BAV should lead to a different threshold 
for prophylactic surgery (as in non-pregnant women). 
Congenital heart disease 
• More data are needed to estimate the risk and the long-term effects 
of pregnancy (including multiple pregnancies), especially in women 
with a Fontan circulation or univentricular hearts. 
• Risk factors for the development of heart failure and arrhythmias 
in pregnant women with (systemic) right-heart failure are poorly 
understood. 
Pulmonary hypertension 
• Defining the optimal timing to start or escalate PAH therapies in 
pregnancy complicated with PAH remains challenging. 
Venous thromboembolism 
• Data on risk stratification of VTE in pregnancy are limited, specifically in those with other pre-existing comorbidities. 
• Data on the use of anticoagulant agents (other than LMWH) are 
limited, just as data on the efficacy and safety of inferior vena cava 
filters and catheter-based thrombectomy (in PE). 
Acquired heart disease 
• The foetal risks associated with the newer HF medications remain 
unclear, particularly regarding exposure during different trimesters. 
• The optimal tools to stratify risk of recurrence for atherosclerotic 
and SCAD ACS are unknown. 
• Physiopathological mechanisms of SCAD in pregnancy are 
unknown. 
• Optimal treatment of SCAD during pregnancy is not well 
established. 
• There is scarce evidence about the necessity of using statins during 
pregnancy in women with cardiovascular risk or established ASCVD. 
• Optimal anticoagulation strategies for women with MHVs during 
pregnancy remain uncertain. 
• The role of anti-factor Xa level monitoring needs to be determined. 
Women’s Heart Clinics 
• Optimal strategies for surveillance and follow-up of women with 
APOs are unclear. 
• It is unclear how social determinants of health (the environmental 
factors that affect how people live, learn, and work) affect APOs. 
• There is a need for studies exploring models of post-natal care, 
starting from the initial antenatal visit through to the end of the 
post-partum period.

Disclaimer. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) Guidelines represent the views of the ESC and the EACTS and were produced 
after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their publication. The ESC and the EACTS are not responsible in the event of any contradiction, discrepancy and/or ambiguity between the ESC/EACTS Guidelines and any other official recommendations or guidelines issued by the relevant public health authorities, in particular in relation 
to good use of healthcare or therapeutic strategies. Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC/EACTS Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well as in the 
determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies; however, the ESC/EACTS Guidelines do not override, in any way whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient and, where appropriate and/or 
necessary, the patient’s caregiver. Nor do the ESC/EACTS Guidelines exempt health professionals from taking into full and careful consideration the relevant official updated recommendations or 
guidelines issued by the competent public health authorities, in order to manage each patient’s case in light of the scientifically accepted data pursuant to their respective ethical and professional 
obligations. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the applicable rules and regulations relating to drugs and medical devices prior to making any clinical decision and to check whether 
a more recent version of this document exists. The ESC and the EACTS warn readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and decline any responsibility in this respect.

1. Preamble 
Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of assisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic 
approach for an individual patient with a given condition. ESC/EACTS 
Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals but do not override 
their individual responsibility to make appropriate and accurate decisions 
in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with 
the patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. 
It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription and to respect the ethical rules of their profession. 
ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given 
topic. Guideline topics are selected for updating after annual expert review of new evidence conducted by the ESC Clinical Practice 
Guidelines (CPG) Committee. ESC Policies and Procedures for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website 
(https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/ 
Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines). 
This guideline updates and replaces the previous version from 2021. This 
Task Force was selected by the ESC and the EACTS to include professionals

involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology and to include 
patient representatives and methodologists. The selection procedure included an open call for authors and aimed to include members from across 
the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty 
Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion. 
Guidelines Task Forces perform a critical review and evaluation of the 
published literature on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches including 
assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Recommendations are based on 
major randomized trials and relevant systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses, when available. Systematic literature searches are conducted in cases of controversy or uncertainty to ensure that all key 
studies were considered. For recommendations related to diagnosis 
and prognosis, additional types of evidence are included, such as diagnostic accuracy studies and studies focused on the development and validation of prognostic models. The strength of each recommendation and 
the level of evidence supporting it are weighed and scored according 
to pre-defined criteria as outlined in Tables 1 and 2. Patient-Reported 
Outcome Measures (PROMs) and Patient-Reported Experience 
Measures (PREMs) are also evaluated when available as the basis for recommendations and/or discussion in these guidelines. 
Evidence tables summarizing key information from relevant studies 
are generated to facilitate the formulation of recommendations, to

enhance comprehension of recommendations after publication, and to 
reinforce transparency in the guidelines development process. The tables are published in their own section of the guidelines and reference 
specific recommendation tables. 
After an iterative process of deliberations, a first Task Force vote on 
all recommendations is conducted prior to the initiation of rounds of 
review. A second Task Force vote on all recommendations is conducted after the final round of review and revision. For each vote, 
the Task Force follows ESC voting procedures and all recommendations require at least 75% agreement among voting members to be approved. Voting restrictions may be applied based on declarations of 
interests. 
The writing and reviewing panels provide declaration-of-interest 
forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential 
sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest are reviewed according to the ESC declaration-of-interest rules, which can 
be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/doi) and are 
compiled in a report published in a supplementary document with 
the guidelines. Funding for the development of these ESC/EACTS 
Guidelines was derived entirely from the ESC and the EACTS with 
no involvement of the healthcare industry. 
The ESC CPG Committee supervises and co-ordinates the preparation of new guidelines and approves their publication. In addition to 
review by the ESC CPG Committee, these ESC/EACTS Guidelines 
underwent multiple rounds of double-blind peer review on a dedicated 
online review platform. The review was conducted by topic experts, including members from ESC National Cardiac Societies, EACTS 
Network of National Cardiac Surgery Societies and from relevant 
ESC Subspecialty Communities. The Guideline Task Force considered 
all review comments and was required to respond to all those classified 
as major. After appropriate revisions, the Task Force, the ESC CPG 
Committee members and the EACTS Council members approved 
the final document for publication in the European Heart Journal and 
in the European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. 
Unless otherwise stated, the guideline content refers to sex, understood as the biological condition of being male or female, defined by 
genes, hormones, and sexual organs. Off-label use of medication may 
be presented in this guideline if a sufficient level of evidence shows 
that it can be considered medically appropriate for a given condition. 
However, decisions on off-label use must be made by the responsible 
health professional giving special consideration to ethical rules concerning healthcare, the specific situation of the patient, patient consent, and 
country-specific health regulations. 
2. Introduction 
New evidence has accumulated since the publication of the 2021 
European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Association for 
Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) Guidelines for the management of valvular 
heart disease, leading to the need for new recommendations (Table 3 
New recommendations) and revision of existing recommendations 
(Table 4 Revised recommendations) concerning the following topics: 
• The importance of shared and patient-centred decision-making by 
multidisciplinary expert Heart Teams working within a regional network has been reinforced. Patients with complex conditions or requiring complex procedures should be referred to high-volume 
centres, where corresponding expertise is concentrated to ensure 
high-quality treatment. 
• Advanced imaging modalities—such as three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), and cardiac 
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging—have gained importance and 
become a central aspect in the screening and evaluation of patients 
with valvular heart disease (VHD). 
• Emphasis is put on the importance of correctly assessing the cause(s) 
and mechanism(s) of all valve diseases. In particular, the distinction 
between atrial and ventricular secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) 
has clear implications in terms of prognosis and management. 
• New evidence has been published regarding the benefits of 
intervention for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis (AS) irrespective of symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and 
flow reserve. 
• The criteria used for decision-making concerning the optimal modality of AS treatment [transcatheter aortic valve (AV) implantation 
(TAVI) or surgical AV replacement (SAVR)] based on a Heart Team 
approach have been refined, including the combination of key aspects 
such as age, procedural risk, and anatomical suitability, incorporating 
estimated life expectancy and lifetime management considerations. 
• Further randomized evidence confirming the mid-term safety and efficacy of TAVI in low-risk patients has been published. 
• The indications for TAVI in patients with bicuspid AV (BAV) stenosis 
or severe aortic regurgitation (AR) at high surgical risk, based on anatomical suitability and a comprehensive Heart Team evaluation, are 
discussed. 
• Several advancements have been made regarding the treatment of 
patients with primary mitral regurgitation (PMR): refinement of the 
criteria for intervention in asymptomatic patients; demonstration 
of the value of minimally invasive mitral valve (MV) surgery to reduce 
the length of hospital stay and accelerate recovery; and large-scale 
data confirming the role of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair 
(TEER) in high-risk patients. 
• Longer-term follow-up data and two new randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) concerning the management of patients with ventricular 
SMR have been published. 
• The evidence for the treatment of tricuspid valve (TV) disease is 
growing—including new randomized data supporting concomitant 
TV repair during left-sided valve surgery, and transcatheter options 
(repair and replacement) that reduce tricuspid regurgitation (TR), 
promote reverse right ventricular (RV) remodelling, and improve 
quality of life compared with medical treatment. 
• Efforts have been made to provide improved guidance regarding the 
diagnostic steps and management of patients with multiple and mixed 
VHD. 
• Definitions of structural valve deterioration (SVD) have been updated and unified. 
• The recommendations concerning the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with VHD have been updated, and the importance of education and (self-)monitoring is emphasized. 
• Sex-specific considerations in patients with VHD have been extended and regrouped into a new dedicated section (see Section 17).   
Because of demographic changes, patients with VHD frequently 
present with concomitant cardiovascular diseases, increasing the complexity of treatment strategies. These Guidelines focus on acquired


<!-- PAGE 9 -->

### Page 9

VHD and do not deal in detail with overlapping cardiovascular diseases 
such as infective endocarditis,5 chronic coronary syndrome,6 and atrial 
fibrillation (AF),7 as well as all scenarios of aortic or congenital disease,8,9 because these topics are covered in separate Guidelines. 
The 2025 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart 
disease aim to be concise, focused on relevant issues for clinicians and 
patients, and to provide clear and simple practical recommendations, 
assisting healthcare providers in their daily clinical decision-making. A 
compilation of the evidence considered for new recommendations, or 
those with an updated class of recommendation or level of evidence, 
can be consulted online (see Supplementary data online, Evidence 
Tables). The Task Force for these Guidelines acknowledges that 
multiple factors influence and ultimately determine the most appropriate treatment of individual patients within a given community. 
These factors include the availability of equipment and technology, 
and the expertise and volumes, in complex procedures, such as valve 
repair or transcatheter interventions. Moreover, given the lack of evidence on some topics related to VHD, several recommendations are 
the result of expert consensus opinion. Therefore, deviations from 
these Guidelines may be appropriate in certain clinical circumstances, 
and decision-making should always be based on a collaborative, multidisciplinary Heart Team approach centred on individual characteristics, needs, and prognosis, as well as the preferences of the informed 
patient.

### 3 The Heart Team and Heart Valve

Centre 
3.1. The Heart Valve Network 
Despite increasing attention within the medical community, VHD continues to be underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population, and public awareness remains low.10–13 Beside screening using 
auscultation and imaging when appropriate, the co-ordinated implementation of Heart Teams, Heart Valve Centres, and Heart Valve 
Networks at a local level represents an essential step to timely diagnose 
and treat patients with VHD. 
An integrated regional Heart Valve Network, incorporating outpatient Heart Valve Clinics (for initial diagnosis and ongoing surveillance) and specialist Heart Valve Centres (for advanced imaging and 
surgical or transcatheter intervention), allows optimal patient care 
through timely access to specialist assessment, accurate diagnosis, improved decision-making, and matching of patients to healthcare providers with appropriate expertise, experience, and resources (Figure 1).12 
In addition, dedicated Heart Valve Clinics ensure consistent application 
of clinical guidelines, efficient use of resources, and overall high-quality 
patient care, which in turn may improve outcomes.14,15 Medical goals 
include careful clinical and echocardiographic evaluation, monitoring 
at appropriate time intervals (so-called ‘watchful waiting’), application 
Transcatheter closure should be considered for suitable 
PVLs with clinically significant regurgitation and/or 
haemolysis in patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk.

of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), timely referral, and 
post-procedural follow-up.15,16 Broader aims include patient education, 
the training of physicians and nurse specialists, swift and efficient access 
to specialist care, and recruitment into clinical trials. 
Heart Valve Centres should ensure that their facilities match institutional and local statutory requirements (Table 5), report procedural volumes and outcomes, and monitor treatment quality. They hold 
responsibility for the training and education of surgeons, interventional 
and imaging cardiologists, dedicated nurses, and allied professionals.17,18 
Expertise in the surgical management of coronary artery disease 
(CAD), vascular diseases, and complications must be available. New 
techniques should be taught by trained mentors using simulator models, when feasible, to minimize learning-curve effects. More broadly, 
Heart Valve Centres co-ordinate the management of patients with 
VHD across the entire Heart Valve Network, supporting services at 
community level, encouraging early referral, and promoting education 
and communication with other medical departments, referring cardiologists, primary care physicians, and rehabilitation clinics. 
3.1.1. Composition of the Heart Team 
The Heart Team is now an established feature of VHD programmes that 
has been formally endorsed by previous ESC/EACTS Guidelines19,20 and 
corresponding organizations worldwide.17 
The value of the Heart Team approach has become increasingly 
apparent as options for the treatment of VHD have extended to include high-risk and inoperable patients (most of whom now undergo 
transcatheter interventions), and low-risk and asymptomatic patients (who derive prognostic benefit from increasingly safe procedures). Despite significant accumulation of data concerning the 
management of VHD over the last two decades, many patients in 
daily practice have clinical characteristics that do not match those 
of participants included in clinical trials. The Heart Team approach 
is therefore particularly helpful when there is uncertainty or a lack 
of strong evidence. 
The Heart Team meeting facilitates balanced presentation of all 
appropriate options for medical, interventional, and surgical 
treatment, using tools and techniques for shared decision-making.

The patient’s preference plays a central role in this process, although 
the Heart Team recommendation should be based upon key objective 
medical considerations (particularly the relative risks and benefits of any 
procedure). 
Meetings should take place on a regular basis with standardized 
minimum datasets (to ensure that all relevant information is available) and appropriate administrative support (often provided by 
specialist nurses with expertise in the care of patients with VHD). 
In-person meetings of the full Heart Team may not be feasible for 
every patient, and local standardized protocols may be implemented to facilitate swift decision-making for specific cohorts (e.g. elderly TAVI candidates or young patients with BAV disease). Equally, 
the need for Heart Team evaluation should not paralyse clinical 
decision-making, and ad hoc discussions remain appropriate in urgent situations. 
Core members of the Heart Team include the cardiologist treating 
the patient (who is best placed to present their case and act as their advocate), specialists in advanced cardiovascular imaging and peri- 
procedural guiding,21,22 surgeons, and interventional cardiologists 
with training and expertise in surgical and transcatheter valve procedures. Specialized nursing personnel play an essential role to improve 
patient information and education, as well as co-ordinate work-up 
and management steps in high-volume centres (Figure 1; Table 5). 
Cardiologists with expertise in heart failure (HF) and electrophysiology, 
as well as geriatricians, cardiovascular anaesthetists, and intensivists involved in peri-procedural care, should also be available to facilitate the 
discussion of particularly complex clinical scenarios when needed (extended Heart Team) (Figure 1; Table 5). 
3.1.2. Procedural volume and clinical outcomes 
The correlation between high institutional (and individual operator) 
volume and best procedural outcomes is intuitive, yet complex. 
Nevertheless, there is evidence of such a relationship for many cardiovascular procedures including SAVR,23,24 surgical MV repair,25,26 mitral 
and tricuspid TEER,27–30 and TAVI (particularly in centres with an associated high-volume SAVR programme).31–33 Studies have shown 
that an annualized operator volume of approximately 25 surgical mitral 
valve procedures,26 50 TAVIs (∼100 per centre),33 a cumulative experience of ∼50 M-TEER procedures per operator/centre,27 and a 
site volume of more than 20 T-TEERs/year30 are associated with improved technical and clinical outcomes. Higher institutional surgical 
volume is associated with lower complication rates,34–36 improved 
management,37 and better infrastructural support.38,39 
National procedural activity varies widely between high-, middle-, and 
low-income countries,40 and it is therefore difficult to provide 
recommendations concerning the precise number of institutional or operator procedures that is required for high-quality care, excellent facilities, 
and processes. Instead, a network approach that highlights the importance 
of centres performing a high volume of procedures (e.g. based upon quartiles in individual countries or regions) seems more suitable, with complex 
procedures concentrated in the centres with the highest volumes (Table 6).

Internal quality assessment (see dedicated document concerning TAVI 
from the ESC41), systematic recording, and public availability of the volume 
and outcome data of the performed procedures are essential. Participation 
in national or international registries should be encouraged. These considerations are of particular importance regarding asymptomatic low-risk patients (where low mortality and procedural safety are paramount), those 
with multiple comorbidities (where the need for multidisciplinary collaboration is essential), and new techniques with a steep learning curve (where 
better results may be obtained at experienced centres). 
There is a pressing need to ensure higher dispersion and adoption of 
interventions for VHD, especially (but not exclusively) in middle- and 
lower-income countries where rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains 
the principal cause of VHD.42,43 Key strategies include awareness programmes, increased public and medical education, simplified and improved diagnostic tools, and measures to reduce costs and facilitate 
access to evidence-based treatment options.44 
4. Imaging of patients with valvular 
heart disease 
Multimodality imaging is now the standard approach in VHD 
management to determine the pathophysiology, assess severity, 
plan interventions, and identify complications (Figure 2). The use 
of imaging for the assessment of each specific valve lesion is described in the corresponding sections. The role of imaging is transversal from diagnosis to follow-up and should encompass an 
integrative assessment. 
4.1. Initial valve assessment 
Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first-line 
examination to confirm valve dysfunction, and determine the aetiology, 
mechanism, and severity of VHD, as well as cardiac chamber anatomy 
and damage.45,46 It should be performed by properly trained imagers.47–49 Quantitative imaging analysis (as opposed to visual) should 
be the goal in all patients with relevant VHD, complemented by qualitative and semi-quantitative evaluation. The severity of VHD should be 
assessed using an integrative approach of all criteria checked for consistency. When TTE is of poor quality or inconclusive, transoesophageal 
echocardiography (TOE) and/or additional diagnostic imaging modalities should be applied (e.g. calcium scoring and anatomy of the 
valve using CCT). In specific clinical scenarios [e.g. thrombosis, prosthetic valve dysfunction, endocarditis, mitral stenosis (MS), assessment 
of MV or TV anatomy], TOE has a central diagnostic role.50,51

Moreover, in patients with regurgitant lesions, particularly AR, CMR has 
gained key value in clinical practice. 
4.2. Associated diseases and conditions 
Imaging plays a crucial role in identifying associated diseases and conditions. The presence of concomitant left ventricular (LV) systolic or diastolic dysfunction, RV systolic dysfunction, red flags indicating 
cardiomyopathies (e.g. amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), 
and aortopathy should prompt further examinations to ensure optimal 
risk stratification and VHD management. In addition to TTE, advanced 
imaging modalities, like CCT, may be required to assess the aorta, 
single-photon emission computed tomography (CT) for detection of 
ischaemia/necrosis, positron emission tomography (PET) for inflammation, nuclear scintigraphy for cardiac amyloidosis, or CMR for tissue 
characterization. 
4.3. Evaluation of valvular heart disease 
dynamics and variability 
Serial imaging studies to detect changes over time, or variability due to 
haemodynamic conditions or initiation/up-titration of medical therapy, are of utmost importance to guide decisions. The dynamic pattern of VHD may convey additional prognostic information. 
Exercise echocardiography helps to identify the cause of dyspnoea, 
unveil symptoms in apparently asymptomatic patients, identifies dynamic changes of VHD severity, and can contribute to refinement 
of the indication for an intervention, especially for AS and mitral regurgitation (MR).52 
4.4. Assessment of extravalvular cardiac 
consequences from valvular heart disease 
Several studies investigating different valve lesions have established 
the relevance of extravalvular cardiac damage in terms of prognosis,53–55 recovery after intervention,56 and quality of life.57 The presence of LV hypertrophy, left atrium (LA) dilatation, LV or RV 
dysfunction and/or remodelling, myocardial fibrosis, and pulmonary 
hypertension (PH) provide important prognostic information, and 
may influence the timing and type of treatment. Although not necessarily chronological in their order of appearance, the understanding 
of cardiac damage, particularly damage involving the LV, is essential 
to guide appropriate medical therapy before and after any intervention. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) including global longitudinal strain (GLS) and CMR can be particularly useful in that 
regard.58–60 
4.5. Evaluation of eligibility, planning, and 
guiding of interventions 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) (preferentially 3D) is the 
preferred tool for the assessment of suitability for aortic, mitral, and 
TV repair.45,49,61–63 Risk stratification for an intervention should integrate all the points mentioned above. 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), including standard 3D 
views, is also the modality of choice to guide atrioventricular transcatheter interventions and should be performed by specially trained 
interventional echocardiographers.61,64 Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) is frequently used to evaluate the relationship of the 
valve with adjacent structures [e.g. coronary arteries and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT)], the extension of calcification [e.g. in mitral annular calcification (MAC)], and for sizing of the prosthesis. 
CT angiography is frequently employed to evaluate the anatomy 
of surgical, arterial, or venous access routes and detect cardiac or 
extracardiac complications (e.g. bleeding or embolic events). 
Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is increasingly utilized to assess 
the presence of CAD. 
5. Clinical evaluation of patients 
with valvular heart disease 
5.1. Clinical examination 
Patients with VHD can be either asymptomatic or present with a wide 
spectrum of symptoms, including acute or chronic HF. An initial meticulous history and a comprehensive physical examination of the patient 
with auscultation, documentation of clinical signs of HF such as dyspnoea, impaired physical capacity and fatigue, peripheral oedema, and 
pleural effusion, as well as a systematic frailty assessment, are crucial.65 
In addition, comorbidities and coexisting cardiac conditions should be 
documented (Figure 3). Particular attention should be given to recent 
changes in symptoms or physical findings indicating a potential worsening of the valve lesion or ventricular function. 
5.2. Assessment of comorbidities and risk 
stratification 
Risk stratification of patients with VHD has been mainly developed 
based on surgical populations. The European System for Cardiac 
Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II)66,67 (https://www. 
euroscore.org) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk 
of 
mortality 
(STS-PROM) 
score68 
(http://riskcalc.sts.org/ 
stswebriskcalc/calculate) are the most commonly used scoring systems 
to estimate surgical risk. Both risk scores have been calibrated to predict post-operative outcomes.69–71 The STS-PROM score is dynamic to 
account for changes in patient risk profiles, the type of procedure (aortic, mitral, and tricuspid), and outcomes over time. The outdated (logistic) EuroSCORE I model systematically overestimated surgical 
mortality.70,72 
In patients considered for TAVI, surgical risk scores have lower accuracy and tend to overestimate the risk of events.73–75 Discrepancies 
between observed and predicted peri-procedural mortality after 
TAVI using surgical risk scores point towards a need for 
TAVI-specific scores. Models predicting short- and medium-term survival specifically designed for TAVI are rarely used in daily clinical practice due to limitations of their predictive performance.76–79 Specific 
scores have also been developed for patients undergoing mitral 
TEER (M-TEER),80–82 but the high heterogeneity of the population 
with MR limits their external validity and therefore routine clinical 
use so far.83 Recently, a dedicated clinical score has been calibrated 
and validated to stratify the risk associated with first-time and repeat 
isolated TV surgery (TRI-SCORE; https://www.tri-score.com/), and its 
use should be encouraged for patients with TV disease,84,85 as an alternative to the more complex Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) 
score for isolated TV surgery (https://isolatedtvsurgcalc.research.sts. 
org/).

Other cardiac conditions and comorbidities—such as CAD, concomitant multiple valve and aortic disease, and RV dysfunction, as 
well as chronic kidney disease (CKD)—are not always appropriately 
captured in risk models, even if they are known to impact outcomes.86 
Similarly, specific unfavourable characteristics like porcelain aorta, mobile aortic atheroma, and previous mediastinal radiation therapy increase the surgical risk, and therefore may favour transcatheter 
treatment options. Frailty, including nutritional state, represents another 
important determinant of outcomes after valve interventions,87–89a 
which can be evaluated using appropriate tools as summarized in a recent consensus statement.90 Several methods have been proposed, 
from the simple Fried Frailty Index to more complex scores91 such 
as the Hospital Frailty Risk Score, which has been validated in a large 
cohort of TAVI and M-TEER patients.92 
The use of PROMs that engage patients in the co-evaluation of their 
health and wellbeing is encouraged. Several scoring systems have been 
proposed and validated for reproducibility and association with clinical 
outcomes, like the Quality of Recovery 15-item PROM or the Kansas 
City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).93–95 
5.3. Biomarkers 
Biomarker levels indicating either cardiac wall stress [e.g. brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)] or myocardial damage (e.g. troponin), in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, may help to monitor VHD 
progress and determine the most appropriate timing of intervention. 
In patients with VHD, the natriuretic peptide ratio [the ratio of 
measured BNP or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic protein

(NT-proBNP) to upper limit of normal for age, sex, and assay] 
has been shown to be a powerful, independent, and incremental 
predictor of mortality.96–98 In patients undergoing AV replacement, 
the accumulation of several elevated biomarkers of cardiovascular 
stress was associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and a higher rate of repeat hospitalization.99,100 
5.4. Exercise testing 
Because of the slow progression of valve lesions, patients may gradually 
limit their activity levels over several years and deny having actual symptoms that can be unmasked by exercise testing.12 This is particularly important in cases of AS, because once symptoms occur there is a sharp 
increase in the risk of sudden cardiac death, unless a valve intervention 
is performed.101–104 Exercise testing may provide additional information about the haemodynamic severity of VHD and help determine 
the risk and optimal timing of intervention by objectively evaluating 
functional capacity.101,103 Cardiopulmonary exercise testing has a 
prognostic role and can assist decision-making in patients with VHD 
of intermediate severity, particularly those with asymptomatic 
AR.101,105,106 
Exercise echocardiography is used for the assessment of LV global 
and segmental function, pulmonary artery pressure, and aortic and mitral pressure gradients.101,107 It also documents exercise-induced increase of MR and TR severity, especially in patients with secondary 
disease.108,109 Prognostic impact has been shown mainly for AS and 
MR.110,111 Misconceptions regarding its risk and tolerability contribute 
to the overall underuse of exercise testing in patients with VHD,12 despite data confirming its safety in most asymptomatic patients.112,113 
5.5. Invasive investigations 
5.5.1. Coronary angiography 
Coronary artery assessment is recommended to evaluate the need for 
revascularization when valve surgery or an intervention is planned. The 
information regarding the existence of concomitant CAD should be 
available at the time of Heart Team discussion. CCTA is recommended 
as an alternative to coronary angiography to rule out CAD in patients 
who are at low or moderate risk of obstructive CAD. 
Coronary blood flow and fractional flow reserve (FFR) are altered in 
the setting of concomitant VHD, and functional haemodynamic assessment of CAD in these patients is not well established.114–118 
5.5.2. Cardiac catheterization 
Right heart catheterization (RHC) should be performed in patients with 
equivocal echocardiographic findings, particularly those with MV disease, as well as in all candidates for the treatment of severe TR. In exceptional cases with unclear AS severity, it can be combined with 
measurements of the transaortic gradients allowing estimation of the 
aortic valve area (AVA). Right heart catheterization contributes to assess the repercussions of any left-sided VHD or LV impairment on 
the pulmonary circulation and right side of the heart. It provides information regarding volume state, cardiac output, and vascular resistance, 
differentiating between pre- and post-capillary PH, and should be ideally 
performed in euvolaemia. 
Measurements of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure v-wave 
can inform about MR severity, but are neither sensitive nor specific, 
and may also be increased if the compliance of the LA is reduced or 
in case of diastolic LV dysfunction, as in patients with MS or chronic 
HF.119 
Similarly, the height of the right atrium (RA) v-wave, and the pressure curve mimicking the RV pattern (‘ventricularization’ of the RA 
pressure), are signs of relevant TR, which are frequently accompanied by increased RV end-diastolic pressure in case of associated RV 
dysfunction. In patients with severe TR, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) should be calculated to unmask pulmonary vascular disease, which may not be captured by echocardiography due to RV 
systolic dysfunction or underestimation of pulmonary pressures because of TR. 
5.6. Patient-centred care and shared 
decision-making 
Given that treatment of VHD typically involves several modalities and 
specialities, and may result in a complex and sometimes time- 
consuming decision-making process, patient education and information, using online material and face-to-face conversations, are essential at each step. A clearly defined point of contact for all questions 
relating to the disease or type of treatments should be communicated 
to the patient and their relatives.120 The symptomatic and prognostic 
benefits, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of any treatment 
option, should be presented in an open and evidence-based manner. 
This includes mortality and risks of reintervention and complications 
(also over the long term), as well as recovery time and the need for 
cardiac, and if necessary psychological, rehabilitation until return to 
physical activity and work. Other issues to be discussed before the 
procedure include the need for oral anticoagulation (OAC) and its 
monitoring, as well as the noise generated by mechanical heart valves 
(MHVs). Information regarding centre experience and volume for a 
specific procedure should be provided. Misconceptions (e.g. subjective overestimation of the risk of surgery) should be addressed and potential interactions with individual lifestyle factors—including social 
activities, family and professional life, and hobbies—should be discussed in detail. 
The Heart Team recommendation regarding the treatment and its 
modality must be based on evidence and anatomical considerations, 
balancing the risks and benefits of available treatment options.16 The 
patient and patient’s relatives need to be well informed about the rationale leading to the Heart Team recommendation, and given ample 
time to share personal preferences.121 At the end of the process, a 
shared decision is made between the treating team and the informed 
patient and relatives (Figure 3). 
6. Management of conditions 
associated with valvular heart 
disease 
6.1. Diagnosis and management of 
coronary artery disease 
The presence of CAD plays an important role in decision-making 
regarding the timing and modality of treatment, and should be 
assessed before Heart Team discussion. In patients with a low 
or moderate pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD (≤50%), 
CCTA is recommended to rule out relevant CAD with high sensitivity.122–124 
Several studies have investigated the value of CCT angiography for 
CAD screening in elderly TAVI candidates. While sensitivity for the detection of obstructive CAD is high (95%–97%), specificity (68%–73%) is  
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               21

### Page 22

modest, mainly explained by the high prevalence of coronary artery calcification and AF in patients with severe AS, which limit imaging resolution and interpretability.125,126 If CCT angiography obtained during 
standard pre-TAVI evaluation is of sufficient quality to exclude relevant 
CAD, omission of invasive coronary angiography should be considered.125–129 
The value of invasive functional haemodynamic assessment of CAD 
in patients with severe AS may be limited, because AS impacts coronary 
haemodynamics. Therefore, caution is warranted in the interpretation 
of functional measurements in the presence of severe AS until more 
data are available.115,116 
Recommendations for the management of chronic CAD associated 
with VHD are provided below (Recommendation Table 1), as well as in 
dedicated guideline documents.6 The indications for coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) in patients undergoing surgery for the treatment of VHD are mainly based on observational data, which do not 
provide detailed information on the degree of stenosis and the complexity of CAD.130 It has been demonstrated that subendocardial blood 
flow in the myocardium improves early after SAVR, most likely due to 
improved cardiac output and reduction of LV wall stress.131 The presence of CAD is associated with peri-operative and late adverse events 
in patients with AS undergoing SAVR132 that likely outweigh the increased risk of peri-procedural adverse events of combined SAVR 
and CABG compared with isolated SAVR. Indeed, in a large observational study, patients with CAD demonstrated better long-term survival after combined SAVR and CABG compared with SAVR alone, 
despite longer cross-clamp times.133 In patients with a primary indication for valve surgery, CABG is recommended in patients with coronary artery stenosis of ≥70% and should be considered in those with 
stenosis of ≥50%–70%, given the opportunity of concomitant full 
revascularization. 
The impact of CAD in patients undergoing TAVI remains under investigation. The randomized Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention (NOTION)-3 
trial compared a strategy of routine percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus conservative management in 455 patients with severe 
symptomatic AS undergoing TAVI, who also had stable CAD and at 
least one stenosis of ≥90% based on visual angiographic assessment 
or FFR of ≤0.80 in a segment with ≥2.5 mm reference diameter.134 
Percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with lower risk 
of a composite endpoint event including all-cause death, myocardial infarction or urgent revascularization at a median follow-up of 2 years. 
Exploratory analyses suggest that the increased risk in the conservative treatment arm was driven by differences in the risk of myocardial 
infarction and urgent revascularization in patients with a diameter 
stenosis of ≥90%, rather than those with positive FFR and stenosis 
of <90%. The risk of bleeding was higher in the PCI than in the conservative 
treatment group. Another multicentre RCT, the PercutAneous Coronary 
inTervention prIor to transcatheter aortic VAlve implantaTION 
(ACTIVATION) trial, was discontinued due to slow recruitment.135 
In this underpowered and thus inconclusive trial, a routine PCI strategy 
of ≥70% stenoses in main epicardial vessels (or ≥50% if protected left 
main or vein graft) did not meet non-inferiority compared with conservative CAD treatment with respect to the composite of all-cause death and 
rehospitalization; moreover, PCI was associated with higher bleeding 
rates. Observational data show that TAVI can be performed safely in patients with untreated CAD with low short- and long-term rates of acute 
coronary syndrome and unplanned coronary revascularization.135–139 
In two recent meta-analyses of mostly observational data, PCI was not 
associated with a mortality benefit in patients with chronic CAD 
undergoing TAVI.140,141 
Optimal timing of PCI in patients undergoing TAVI remains yet to 
be determined. In NOTION-3, PCI was performed before TAVI in 
the majority of the patients (concomitantly or shortly after in only 
26% of the patients). Decision-making concerning the timing of 
PCI should take into account the type of valve used for TAVI and 
the complexity of the coronary lesions.142,143 Valves with a high 
frame—particularly in the context of a narrow aortic root, commissural misalignment, or valve-in-valve procedures—can pose challenges for coronary access following TAVI.144,145 The presence 
of significant CAD should therefore be considered for optimal 
transcatheter valve selection and reinforces the importance of optimized implantation technique and commissural alignment.143,146 
Several RCTs comparing the value and timing of PCI with 
medical therapy are ongoing (NCT04634240, NCT04310046, and 
NCT05078619). 
Based on the available data, PCI should be considered in patients with 
a primary indication to undergo TAVI and high-grade (≥90%) coronary 
artery stenosis in large vessels of ≥2.5 mm. In patients with stenosis of 
≥70%, PCI may be considered based on symptom status.142,143 In patients with ischaemic ventricular SMR, surgical revascularization of 
CAD has been associated with MR reduction147 and favourable clinical 
outcomes in observational studies.148,149 According to very limited 
data, improvement of SMR may occur in a minority of patients (about 
one-third) after PCI, which may therefore be considered prior to MV 
intervention.150 
For patients with VHD presenting with acute coronary syndrome, 
treatment decisions should be made according to the most recent 
ESC Guidelines.151 In patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, it may be particularly challenging to 
determine the leading cause of elevated troponin levels, which are 
also frequently observed in decompensated VHD. Therefore, the 
treatment strategy should be determined by the Heart Team, taking 
into account symptoms, as well as coronary, valve, and access 
anatomy.136,138,139

6.2. Atrial fibrillation 
The interplay between AF and VHD is complex, and has an essential 
role in the prognosis and evolution of VHD during the patient’s lifetime. 
Valvular heart disease is independently associated with AF and almost 
one-third of patients with AF have a history of VHD.152 Conversely, 
AF is the main trigger of the development of atrial secondary MR and 
TR. In a recent cohort study, 8% of individuals with AF developed moderate or severe TR within 3 years of follow-up compared with only 2% 
in those in sinus rhythm.153 While disturbed annular dynamics have 
been postulated,150,154 the exact pathophysiology leading to secondary 
atrioventricular VHD in some, but not all patients with AF remains 
largely unclear. 
Detailed recommendations on the anticoagulation management of 
patients with VHD and AF are provided below (Recommendation 
Table 2) and in Section 14, as well as in specific Guidelines.7 Patients 
with a combination of VHD and AF have a high incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding complications.155 DOACs have replaced vitamin K 
antagonists (VKAs) in most clinical scenarios and are recommended for 
patients with VHD presenting with AF, except for patients with a MHV 
or mitral stenosis with a valve area ≤2.0 cm2. The use of apixaban,156 
dabigatran,157 edoxaban,158 and rivaroxaban159 is supported by subgroup analyses of large RCTs. Recommendations regarding the antithrombotic treatment of patients with MHVs and biological heart valves 
(BHVs) are described in Section 14 of these Guidelines. 
In the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS) III trial, surgical left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in patients with AF and a 
CHA2DS2-VASc [congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, age ≥75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled), vascular disease, age 65–74, sex category (female)] score of ≥2 points 
undergoing cardiac surgery was associated with a 33% reduction of 
the risk of stroke or systemic embolism at a mean follow-up of 
3.8 years.160 These findings were confirmed by a large meta-analysis including four RCTs.161 A subanalysis of LAAOS III showed that the benefit of LAAO remains consistent irrespective of the use of VKAs or 
DOACs, as well as in the absence of OAC (although representing 
only 10% of the included population).162 In an RCT including patients 
with severe AS and AF undergoing TAVI, concomitant transcatheter 
LAAO was non-inferior to medical therapy with respect to a composite 
primary endpoint including all-cause mortality, stroke, and major bleeding at 2 years. Of note, rates of major or life-threatening bleeding were 
similar in the two groups and arterial or venous thromboembolisms 
more frequent in the TAVI/LAAO arm, leaving uncertainty regarding 
the usefulness of combining both procedures.163 
6.3. Cancer and radiation therapy 
Valvular heart disease is commonly associated with cancer and represents a well-known long-term side effect of intensive radiation therapy176 for treatment of Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast 
cancer, and other thoracic malignancies.177 Clinically significant VHD 
most commonly appears decades after radiotherapy. The incidence 
of radiation-induced VHD is increasing owing to longer survival of patients with cancer. Risk factors are summarized in Supplementary data 
online, Table S1. Patients at risk should be screened for VHD using TTE 
10 years after radiation exposure and followed up every 5 years 
thereafter.178

Radiotherapy may lead to aortic and/or valvular calcification, CAD of 
proximal segments, restrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial adhesions 
and calcifications with constriction, restrictive lung disease, chest wall 
scarring, and impaired wound healing, especially in patients who underwent radiation by means of older techniques (>20 years ago). The above 
factors complicate any surgical approach and increase the operative risk, 
which is underestimated by traditional risk scores.179–181 TAVI is proposed as an alternative for patients presenting with radiation-induced 
AS in the 2022 ESC Guidelines on cardio-oncology182 based on favourable, 
but limited, observational data,183,184 because this category of patients 
has been excluded from RCTs.183,184 Furthermore, M-TEER in patients 
presenting with radiation-induced MV disease with MR is often limited 
by thickened leaflets with restricted movement and subsequent risk of 
iatrogenic stenosis. 
In patients with active or stable cancer and severe AS, both TAVI and 
SAVR can be considered based on life expectancy, age, prognosis, and 
disability following cancer treatment, with a trend towards more TAVI 
utilization.185 TAVI procedural complication rates appear similar compared with those of control subjects without cancer.186 To avoid futility, treatment decisions discussed by the Heart Team should involve the 
treating oncologists.5,182 
6.4. Prophylaxis of rheumatic fever 
Rheumatic heart disease remains the most common cause of death 
from VHD worldwide.187 Prevention should preferentially target the 
first occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. Correct diagnosis and early 
antibiotic treatment of group A Streptococcus throat or skin infection 
is key for primary prevention. Large-scale screening combined with 
prophylaxis in children or adolescents with latent RHD appears to be 
an effective strategy to reduce the risk of disease progression and 
RHD prevalence.188–190 In patients with established RHD, secondary 
long-term prophylaxis with benzathine benzyl penicillin 1.2 million 
international units (IU) every 3–4 weeks over 10 years is recommended to prevent recurrent episodes, especially in children and adolescents. Long-term prophylaxis into adulthood should be considered 
in high-risk patients according to the severity of VHD and exposure 
to group A Streptococcus.191,192 
6.5. Cardiogenic shock and acute heart 
failure 
Acute presentation or decompensation of VHD can result in cardiogenic shock due to rapid haemodynamic deterioration and altered cardiac function. Alternatively, pre-existing VHD can be a bystander of an 
acute cardiovascular condition further exacerbating circulatory impairment until the occurrence of cardiogenic shock. In this setting, assessment of the severity of VHD, as well as its contribution to acute HF, 
may be difficult. Evidence concerning acute VHD management in this 
context is scarce and only exists for the MV and AV.193,194 
Hospital admission for acute decompensated AS is a frequent problem seen in up to 25% of AS hospitalizations.195,196 However, only a minority of these patients (1.6%–3.2%) present with cardiogenic 
shock.197,198 While intensive care treatment remains the cornerstone 
of haemodynamic stabilization and support, an intervention should be 
considered early, because it represents the only way to reverse progressive organ dysfunction due to low cardiac output. Balloon aortic 
valvuloplasty has been used in this context in the past, but has been 
largely replaced by TAVI in recent years, due to the high risk of severe 
AR and mortality in the acute setting.199–201 Several large observational 
studies have established the feasibility of TAVI in patients with 
cardiogenic shock with similar device success, even if LVEF is low, although 30-day mortality remains higher (13%–19%) compared with 
routine TAVI.194,197,198 Surgery represents the preferred treatment 
in patients with acute AR, while TAVI has only been described in individual cases or patients with a failed surgical valve (valve-in-valve). Fast 
pacing over a temporary pacemaker lead shortens the diastole and may 
temporarily improve haemodynamics until the intervention.5,8 
Except for papillary muscle rupture, acute PMR rarely leads to cardiogenic shock and may be best treated by surgical valve repair or replacement. In contrast, increasing evidence supports the use of 
M-TEER in patients with acute ventricular SMR, particularly following 
acute myocardial infarction, due to lower mortality compared with surgery or medical treatment in propensity-matched analyses.194,202,203 
This strategy might also be helpful to facilitate weaning from mechanical 
circulatory support. 
6.6. Palliative care 
In some patients with advanced VHD not qualifying for surgical or 
transcatheter therapies, medical HF treatment remains the only, and 
sometimes best, available option. These patients usually present late, 
have extensive cardiac damage, develop terminal HF during the natural 
evolution of VHD, and are ineligible for mechanical circulatory support 
or heart transplantation (HTx). Early implementation of expert multidisciplinary palliative and end-of-life care, with the support of HF specialists,204–206 reduces the number of hospitalizations and improves 
quality of life and symptom burden, in particular dyspnoea, pain, and 
anxiety.207 Continuous co-ordination between all involved subspecialties, and transparent communication with the patient and their relatives, are key to ensure high quality of care. 
7. Aortic regurgitation 
7.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Chronic AR is mainly due to intrinsic abnormalities of the AV cusps and/ 
or secondary to progressive dilatation of the aortic root and/or ascending aorta. In high-income countries, degenerative changes are the leading cause of AR, while RHD is more frequent in middle- and 
low-income countries.12 Acute presentations are usually related to infective endocarditis or extension of aortic dissection into the aortic 
root. Chronic pure severe AR is more frequent in men and is associated 
with BAV and concomitant dilatation of the aorta in more than one-half 
of cases.208 
7.2. Evaluation 
During stepwise AR evaluation, the following aspects should be addressed: the severity of AR, its mechanism, and aetiology; the haemodynamic impact on LV function and pulmonary pressure; and 
evaluation of the ascending aorta. While echocardiography is the first- 
line modality, CMR and CCT are more accurate for the measurement 
of specific parameters (Figure 4). The results of the evaluation need to 
take into consideration the haemodynamic condition of the patient, 
particularly the blood pressure (BP), since high pressures can lead to 
overestimation of the regurgitant volume (RVol). 
Assessment of AR severity with TTE follows an integrative approach 
considering qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative parameters, 
but remains challenging.45 Consequences of AR on LV size and function 
must be carefully assessed. Cut-offs for intervention are mostly 
based on two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic measurements. 
However, 3D echocardiography and CMR allow more accurate


<!-- PAGE 25 -->

### Page 25

evaluation of LV volumes and LVEF than 2D echocardiography, and are 
useful in borderline cases (Figure 4).45,209 Strain imaging can be helpful in 
identifying subclinical LV dysfunction209–211 and can therefore influence 
the optimal timing of intervention. Reduced longitudinal strain and contractile reserve at stress echocardiography,212 elevated biomarkers 
(BNP),213,214 and the presence of myocardial fibrosis detected by 
CMR need to be integrated in the decision-making process, even if 
not entirely validated yet.209 
Given its close relationship with AV function, accurate measurements of the aortic diameter are required at all levels: the annulus, 
sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, and ascending aorta.8,215,216 
The largest diameter is used to indicate the specific aortic phenotype: root phenotype, ascending phenotypes, and extended or 
mixed forms (see Supplementary data online, Figure S1).8 The mechanism of AR and aortic diameters determine suitability for AV sparing or repair.217,218

The morphology of the AV represents a critical aspect in the diagnosis and treatment of AR. Pure AR in the context of BAV uncommonly 
manifests with normal aortic diameters, being more often associated 
with a dilated ascending aorta and/or root. It is important to define 
the valve phenotype to determine the repair probability and long-term 
result of AV repair or AV-sparing procedures. The degree of symmetry 
is an important predictor of BAV reparability with better long-term results in more symmetric phenotypes.219–221 
7.3. Medical therapy 
Medical therapy, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors 
(ACE-Is) or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, may provide 
symptomatic improvement in individuals with chronic severe AR for 
whom surgery is not feasible or contraindicated. The value of ACE-Is 
or dihydropyridines in delaying surgery in the presence of moderate 
or severe AR in asymptomatic patients has not been established, and 
their use is not recommended for this indication. The use of beta- 
blockers increases the length of the diastole and therefore the RVol, 
and should be used with caution if indicated for another reason. 
However, beta-blockers can be used along with ACE-Is or angiotensin 
receptor blockers (ARBs) after surgery, if indicated (systolic HF or 
heart rate control).222,223 
7.4. Indications for intervention 
Acute severe AR usually requires immediate surgery depending on the 
aetiology, such as infective endocarditis or spontaneous, traumatic, 
or iatrogenic aortic dissection.5,8 Surgery for the treatment of chronic 
severe AR is indicated depending on symptoms and/or the effects of 
the RVol on LV size and function (see Recommendation Table 3 and  
Figure 5). The presence of associated aortic dilatation dictates surgery, 
irrespective of AR severity. When the patient is symptomatic and AR 
severe, surgery is recommended unless the anticipated surgical risk is 
prohibitive.224–228 Concomitant surgical treatment of severe AR 
is also recommended, irrespective of symptoms, in patients requiring 
CABG, ascending aorta surgery, or any other cardiac surgical 
procedures.229,230 
For the asymptomatic patient with severe AR, indications for 
surgery are based on the degree of functional impairment of the 
LV [LVEF ≤50%, left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD)  
>50 mm, or left ventricular end-systolic diameter indexed to body surface area (BSA) (LVESDi) >25 mm/m2, especially in those with small 
BSA (BSA <1.68 m2) and elderly patients with low ventricular compliance].226,228,231–234 If surgery is deemed low risk, there is observational 
evidence from echocardiographic studies that early intervention might 
be beneficial for long-term prognosis when LVEF is ≤55%, LVESDi is 
>22 mm/m2, and/or left ventricular end-systolic volume indexed to 
BSA (LVESVi) is >45 mL/m2.235–239 A volumetric cut-off value of 
LVESVi ≥43 mL/m2 using CMR was recently proposed to guide the 
management of asymptomatic patients240,241 and appears to have better predictive value than LV diameter.242 Surgery may also be discussed 
in selected low-risk asymptomatic patients with significant LV dilatation 
(left ventricular end-diastolic diameter >65 mm) and progressive increase of LV diameters and/or decrease of LVEF during follow-up. 
Exercise testing should be performed, when feasible, in patients with 
severe AR who do not report symptoms and do not meet criteria 
for surgery.212 
AV replacement is still the standard surgical approach in most AR 
cases (see Section 14.1 regarding prosthesis type considerations). 
However, owing to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of 
the aortic root (see Supplementary data online, Figure S1) paralleled 
with favourable long-term results, valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) and AV repair are increasingly performed in centres 
with appropriate expertise (Figure 5).243–255 In patients with root enlargement and good tissue quality (i.e. pliable AV cusps with normal motion), a valve-sparing procedure has been demonstrated to be superior 
to the use of a composite valve graft (Bentall procedure) in terms of 
long-term mortality and overall morbidity (thromboembolism and 
endocarditis, with similar need for reoperation),250–253,255–257 and 
should be therefore favoured by experienced centres, in particular 
in patients with an estimated long life expectancy.258 Valve preservation or valve repair should also be considered for patients with BAV 
based on age, anatomical presentation, and centre experience 
(Figure 5).220,245,246,259 
When performed by experienced surgeons in well-selected young 
individuals, pulmonary autograft implantation (Ross operation) may 
also be a good alternative to prosthetic valve replacement.260–263 
TAVI may be considered at experienced centres for selected patients 
with AR who are ineligible for surgery. The use of non-dedicated transcatheter valves for this indication is off-label and associated with an increased risk of valve malpositioning and residual AR, with consecutively 
higher rates of second valve implantation (about 10%) or surgical conversion, as compared with TAVI in AS.264–268 Dedicated devices appear 
to minimize the risk of valve migration and residual AR in selected patients, but are associated with a high new permanent pacemaker implantation rate (24%).267–269 
Aortic dilatation is closely linked to AR. Dedicated ESC Guidelines 
give guidance regarding the evaluation and management of aortic 
root and ascending aortic dilatation.8 The aortic phenotype (see  
Supplementary data online, Figure S1), degree and rate of progression 
of aortic dilatation, and the underlying aetiology all affect timing of surgery, with the main indication being maximum aortic diameter.270–272 
Dilation of the aortic root, which typically occurs in Marfan syndrome 
and other patients with connective tissue disease, has a worse prognosis compared with isolated dilatation of the ascending aorta and requires closer surveillance.270–272 Surgery is recommended in all 
patients with a maximal aortic root or ascending aneurysm diameter 
of ≥55 mm. In the presence of additional risk factors, a threshold of 
50 mm may be considered for selected low-risk patients treated at experienced centres.8 If the patient has an established indication for AV 
surgery (due to AR or AS), concomitant surgery of the aortic root 
or the ascending aorta should be considered at a diameter of 
≥45 mm. This threshold has been more clearly demonstrated in patients with BAV and should also be based on the patient’s height273 
or specific intraoperative findings, such as the shape and thickness of 
the aortic wall. 
7.5. Follow-up 
A multimodality imaging approach45,274 and biomarkers like BNP213,214 
might help identify patients at increased risk of LV damage early 
and guide the appropriate timing of intervention. Yearly follow-up is recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe AR. Closer follow- 
up (3–6 months) is recommended for those approaching thresholds 
for surgery, or showing a progressive dilatation of the LV or decrease 
of LVEF. Cardiac magnetic resonance can be especially useful in such 
a setting. Patients with moderate AR should be followed on a yearly basis, with echocardiography performed every 2 years. 
When a dilated ascending aorta is initially diagnosed by TTE, a multislice electrocardiographic-triggered CCT/CMR scan is recommended

to confirm maximal diameter, rule out isolated single sinus dilatation, 
and provide a baseline reference. When the baseline aortic diameter 
is >45 mm, a second TTE examination is recommended at 6 months 
to confirm the stability of the finding, followed by serial examinations 
on a yearly basis thereafter.275 Any increase of >3 mm should be validated by CT angiography/CMR and compared with baseline data.275 
After repair of the ascending aorta, patients with Marfan syndrome 
and other connective tissue diseases remain at risk for dissection of untreated portions of the aorta, and require lifelong regular multidisciplinary follow-up at an expert centre.8 
7.6. Special patient populations 
Patients with concomitant VHD and those with AS combined with AR 
are discussed in Section 13.3.3. In patients with moderate AR and indication for CABG or MV surgery, the decision to treat the AV should be 
discussed by the Heart Team based on the aetiology of AR and other 
clinical factors, like the estimated life expectancy and the operative risk, 
as data show that progression of moderate AR may be very slow.276 
The presence of aortic dilation and AR in asymptomatic patients 
poses the problem of limiting the level of physical activity, but consistent data are lacking. Current recommendations for participation in 
competitive sport are restrictive, especially regarding isometric exercise in patients with connective tissue disease,277 while a more liberal 
approach is likely to be appropriate in other patients. 
Given the familial risk of thoracic aortic aneurysms, screening with 
appropriate imaging studies and testing for genetic abnormalities in 
first-degree relatives is indicated in patients with connective tissue disease.278 Since aortic dilation is present in ∼10% of first-degree relatives 
of patients with a BAV, it is also considered appropriate to encourage 
echocardiographic screening in this specific population.275,279 
8. Aortic stenosis 
8.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Even if AS is the most common primary valve lesion referred for intervention in Europe and North America,12 underdiagnosis and undertreatment remain relevant concerns.10 Degenerative pathogenesis 
with cusps calcification is most common in developed countries and 
prevalence is rising rapidly because of the ageing population.11,12,187 
BAVs, or more rarely unicuspid AVs, are prone to earlier degeneration, 
constitute the dominant valve morphology in younger patients requiring AV replacement, and are frequently associated with dilatation of the 
aortic root or ascending aorta.280,281 In low- and middle-income countries, rheumatic aetiology remains frequent and AS usually presents 
combined with rheumatic MV disease.282 
8.2. Evaluation 
8.2.1. Echocardiography and cardiac computed 
tomography 
Aortic stenosis is a disease slowly evolving from mild to severe valve 
obstruction as a consequence of increasing valve fibrosis and calcification, although progression accelerates as haemodynamic severity 
increases.283 
Echocardiography is key to confirm the diagnosis and allows comprehensive assessment of the anatomy and severity of stenosis. Evaluation 
of the haemodynamic consequences on cardiac function and geometry, 
and the detection of aortic pathology or concomitant valve disease, 
provide important prognostic information that may influence management.284 Staging of extravalvular damage has been proposed,53 but 
it may be difficult to attribute other cardiac abnormalities to AS itself, 
because comorbidities are frequent in patients with AS and the 
observed damage may not occur in the expected chronological sequence. However, the detection of concomitant cardiac conditions

cardiomyopathy] may help to optimize medical treatment before and 
after valve intervention.285,286 
Current European recommendations for the echocardiographic 
grading of AS rely on measurement of the mean pressure gradient 
(most robust parameter), peak transvalvular velocity (Vmax), and effective AVA. Although AVA is theoretically the ideal parameter for assessing severity, there are numerous technical limitations associated with 
its calculation.284,287 
Aortic stenosis may be further categorized according to flow state 
based on stroke volume index (SVi) when there is discordance between 
echocardiographic parameters (Figure 6). A threshold of 35 mL/m2 is 
conventionally accepted to discern low from normal flow, although 
sex-specific thresholds have been proposed.292  
Concordant criteria: 
• High-gradient AS [mean gradient ≥40 mmHg, Vmax ≥4.0 m/s, AVA 
≤1 cm2 (or ≤0.6 cm2/m2)] is considered severe irrespective of LV 
function and flow conditions.  
Discordant criteria: 
• Low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced LVEF  
(mean gradient <40 mmHg, AVA ≤1 cm2, SVi ≤35 mL/m2, LVEF <50%). 
• Low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved LVEF  
(mean gradient <40 mmHg, AVA ≤1 cm2, SVi ≤35 mL/m2,  
LVEF ≥50%). 
• Normal-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved EF  
(mean gradient <40 mmHg, AVA ≤1 cm2, SVi >35 mL/m2,  
LVEF ≥50%). 
• Discordant high-gradient AS (mean gradient ≥40 mmHg,  
AVA >1 cm2).  
Patients with discordant normal-flow, low-gradient AS usually have 
moderate stenosis.293–295 Discordant high-gradient AS is considered 
severe if not caused by a reversible high-flow status.296–298 
In patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced LVEF, dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) can help to discriminate between pseudo-severe and true severe AS in the presence of flow 
reserve (increase in stroke volume of ≥20%).289,299 
Cardiac computed tomography calcium AV scoring is readily available and provides important adjunctive information in patients with 
low-flow, low-gradient AS because it correlates with haemodynamic 
severity, progression, and clinical outcomes.300,301 Values of >2000 
Agatston units (AU) in men and >1200 AU in women indicate severe 
AS with high sensitivity and specificity (∼85%).302,303 While higher 
thresholds (men >3000 AU, women >1600 AU) are very specific, severe AS becomes unlikely in patients with calcium AV scoring of 
<1600 AU in men and <800 AU in women.284,302,303 Cautious interpretation is required in patients who can develop severe AS without 
pronounced AV calcification such as in BAV, concomitant amyloidosis, 
and predominantly fibrotic stenosis associated with post-rheumatic, 
radiation-induced and inflammatory disease.304–308 
In low-flow, low gradient AS with reduced LVEF, CCT AV calcium 
scoring and DSE provide complementary information. If findings are 
equivocal, an integrated assessment considering all available clinical, 
morphological, and haemodynamic factors is required. 
8.2.2. Additional diagnostic and prognostic 
parameters 
The ratio of the LVOT to the AV Doppler jet velocity time integral 
(VTI, dimensionless index or velocity ratio) does not require 
calculation of LVOT area and may assist evaluation when other parameters are equivocal (<0.25 suggests that severe AS is highly likely).309 
Assessment of GLS can be useful for risk stratification310 and evaluation of extravalvular cardiac damage.311,312 It provides additional information regarding LV function and a threshold of −15% may contribute 
to identifying patients with severe asymptomatic AS at increased risk of 
clinical deterioration or premature mortality.59 
Estimated valvuloarterial impedance has been shown to be prognostic 
of adverse clinical outcomes before and after valve replacement.313–315 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) allows morphological 
evaluation of the valve, planimetry of AVA and assessment of potential subvalvular obstruction (unless there is acoustic shadowing caused by calcification), and evaluation of concomitant valve disease, and can be of value for 
peri-procedural imaging in challenging clinical or anatomical scenarios.316 
Natriuretic peptides can be used to arbitrate the sources of symptoms in patients with multiple potential causes and help to identify 
those with high-risk asymptomatic AS who may benefit from early 
intervention.97,317 
Exercise testing can unmask symptoms and haemodynamic intolerance 
(fall in BP >20 mm Hg) and is recommended for risk stratification in 
asymptomatic patients with severe AS.102,318 Exercise echocardiography 
may provide additional prognostic information by assessing the increase in 
mean pressure gradient and change in LV function.319 Cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing, eventually complemented by echocardiography, can 
help to uncover cardiac dysfunction in asymptomatic patients, discriminate cardiac from pulmonary limitation or deconditioning in patients with 
non-specific symptoms, and inform risk stratification.105,106,320,321 
Cardiac magnetic resonance is used to identify altered global LV 
geometry due to remodelling, as well as to quantify myocardial scarring 
and diffuse fibrosis, which are associated with the occurrence of adverse events.322–324 
Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis may coexist with AS in elderly patients and the two conditions may causally interrelate.325 When transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is suspected, the presence of monoclonal protein 
in serum and urine should be excluded using immunofixation and quantitative determination of free light chains, and diagnosis ascertained by 
means of diphosphonate scintigraphy.326 Despite the limited long-term 
prognosis associated with cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis, patients 
with concomitant severe AS usually benefit from valve intervention.327 
LV catheterization is not recommended unless there are symptoms 
and signs of severe AS, and non-invasive investigations are inconclusive. 
8.2.3. Procedural planning 
Cardiac computed tomography is key to determining suitability for 
TAVI and planning the procedure. It is the preferred imaging tool to assess AV anatomy including annulus size, dimensions of the aortic root 
and ascending aorta, the extent and distribution of valve and LVOT calcification, the distance of coronary ostia from the annular plane, optimal 
fluoroscopic projections for transcatheter valve deployment, and the 
feasibility of vascular access.49,328,329 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), which is more operator- 
dependent and does not allow assessment of coronary and peripheral 
vascular anatomy, or CMR may be considered when CCT is difficult to interpret or relatively contraindicated (e.g. in patients with renal failure).330,331 
8.3. Medical therapy 
No medical therapies have been shown to influence the natural 
history of AS to date. Neither statins, which demonstrated 
favourable effects in pre-clinical studies,332–334 nor substances

targeting calcification pathways alter disease progression.335,336 
Coexistent hypertension should be treated to avoid additional afterload, preferably using renin-angiotensin system blockers, although 
careful titration is required to avoid symptomatic hypotension.337 
In patients with symptomatic severe AS and HF, initiation of medical 
therapy or temporary improvement in symptoms should not delay 
intervention. Medication frequently requires re-adjustment following 
valve intervention and preventive therapies should be implemented 
according to current Guidelines.338 In patients with persisting HF 
and/or reduced LVEF, medical therapy should be introduced before 
and up-titrated after valve intervention according to the current HF 
Guidelines.339,340 
8.4. Indication for intervention 
8.4.1. Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis 
Symptomatic severe AS has an unfavourable prognosis if left untreated, 
and early intervention is strongly recommended in all patients with an 
estimated life expectancy exceeding 1 year10 (Figure 7). 
Intervention is recommended in all eligible symptomatic patients 
with high-gradient severe AS. However, management of patients with 
low-gradient AS is more challenging: 
• Low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced LVEF: reduced LV function usually improves after intervention if it is predominantly 
caused by excessive afterload.341–343 However, improvement is 
unlikely if the primary cause is fibrosis due to myocardial infarction 
or cardiomyopathy. Intervention is recommended when severe AS 
is confirmed by CCT (calcium scoring) or stress echocardiography,341 while patients with pseudo-severe AS should receive 
GDMT.339,344 Although the absence of flow reserve is associated 
with increased surgical and long-term mortality, both modes of 
intervention improved LVEF and clinical outcomes in observational 
studies.341,342,345–347 
• Low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved LVEF: outcomes are improved with intervention (either TAVI or SAVR) compared with 
medical treatment alone in patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS 
and preserved LVEF.348,349 Intervention should therefore be considered in patients with symptoms after careful confirmation that AS is 
severe. 
• Normal-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved LVEF: prognosis 
of these patients is similar to that of moderate AS. Unless 
multimodality diagnostic evaluation clearly suggests severe 
AS, regular clinical and echocardiographic surveillance is 
recommended.293,294,350  
8.4.2. Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis 
Up to 40% of patients with severe AS do not report symptoms at the 
time of diagnosis.351,352 In roughly one-third of these, exercise testing 
can uncover symptoms or reduced exercise capacity attributable to 
AS,102,103,318 and such patients should be treated as symptomatic. 
However, exercise testing is not always feasible because of frailty or impaired mobility.353 Intervention is recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe AS and an LVEF of <50% without another 
cause.14,102,318,319,354–360 For patients with severe high-gradient AS 
and no adverse prognostic features, close active clinical surveillance, 
so-called ‘watchful waiting’, has previously been the default management strategy. However, four RCTs comparing early AV intervention 
with clinical surveillance suggest that early intervention should be 
considered as an alternative in patients at low procedural risk.360–363 
This approach is reinforced if additional adverse prognostic features 
(very high Vmax,14,353,364 elevated natriuretic peptides,97,317,365,366 severe valve calcification,303,364 rapid Vmax progression,353,364 or LVEF 
of <55%14,354,356–359) are present. Restricted local resources (that 
may impede close surveillance) or long waiting lists (that preclude 
prompt treatment when symptoms develop) are further arguments favouring an early intervention. 
The Evaluation of TAVR Compared to Surveillance for Patients with 
Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis (EARLY TAVR) trial360 randomized 901 patients to early TAVI or clinical surveillance and demonstrated 
a reduction of 50% in the primary composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, stroke, or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular causes associated with pre-emptive intervention.360 The result was driven by 26.2% 
of the patients in the clinical surveillance group who converted to TAVI 
within 6 months of randomization due to the development of symptoms 
or adverse prognostic factors. There was no significant difference in 
strokes and all-cause mortality over 5-year follow-up. 
In the Early Valve Replacement Guided by Biomarkers of LV 
Decompensation in Asymptomatic Patients with Severe AS 
(EVoLVeD) RCT, which included 224 asymptomatic patients with severe AS and myocardial fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement on 
CMR), early valve intervention (with SAVR or TAVI) failed to reduce 
the incidence of all-cause death or unplanned AS-related hospitalization 
compared with clinical surveillance.361 However, the study was underpowered and the median time to intervention was prolonged to 
5 months in the experimental arm. 
Two previous smaller trials compared early SAVR with clinical 
surveillance. In the Randomized Comparison of Early Surgery vs 
Conventional 
Treatment 
in 
Very 
Severe 
Aortic 
Stenosis 
(RECOVERY) trial (145 patients), there was a reduction in all-cause 
mortality following early SAVR over a mean follow-up of 6.2 years.362 
In the Aortic Valve Replacement Versus Conservative Treatment 
in Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis (AVATAR) trial (157 
patients), a reduction in the composite primary endpoint was noted 
after a mean follow-up of 2.5 years with a significant reduction in 
HF hospitalizations and mortality at long-term follow-up.363,367 
Limitations of these surgical studies included their small sample sizes, 
enrolment of selected young populations at low surgical risk (mean 
ages 64 and 67 years, respectively), and inclusion of patients with mostly very severe AS. 
A meta-analysis of the four RCTs showed that early intervention is 
associated with a significant reduction in unplanned cardiovascular or 
HF hospitalization and stroke, but not all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Limitations of this analysis include the heterogeneity of the 
pooled trials and lack of granularity with respect to specific events owing to the study-level analysis.368 
Additional RCTs (NCT04204915 and NCT03972644) will further 
inform and refine the management of patients with severe asymptomatic AS. 
8.4.3. Moderate aortic stenosis 
Surgical intervention for moderate AS should only be performed in patients undergoing CABG,369 surgery of the ascending aorta or other 
valve disease (see Section 13). There is evidence of an association between moderate AS and adverse outcomes in patients with and without HF with reduced EF (HFrEF),370–372 but it is unknown whether 
this is causal or related to comorbidities. In an early terminated trial randomizing 178 patients with moderate AS and HFrEF to TAVI or clinical 
surveillance, no differences with respect to hard clinical endpoints were

found, while patients undergoing TAVI had improved quality of 
life (change in KCCQ of 12.8 ± 21.9 points vs 3.2 ± 22.8 points; 
P = 0.018).373 Ongoing trials are expected to provide new insights 
(NCT04889872 and NCT05149755). 
8.5. Treatment options 
The mode of AV intervention depends on the estimated life expectancy, expected prosthesis durability, patient preference, and specific 
trade-offs associated with different treatment options (Figure 8). 
Most patients with AS undergoing valve intervention in Europe and 
North America receive a BHV (by either SAVR or TAVI).374 BHVs 
do not require long-term anticoagulation but have limited durability 
that varies between devices and is inversely associated with age.375 
MHVs are durable but require long-term anticoagulation, with associated thromboembolic and bleeding risks.260,376 In general, an MHV 
should be preferred in patients aged <60 years and a BHV in patients 
aged >65 years in aortic position (see Section 14.1). 
The Ross procedure (replacement of the AV with the patient’s pulmonary autograft combined with homograft pulmonary valve 
replacement) is associated with excellent long-term survival when performed in selected patients at centres with high expertise.260,263,377,378 
Although a valuable surgical option in young patients with prolonged life 
expectancy in whom anticoagulation is undesirable or contraindicated, 
it is associated with procedural complexity and the need for reintervention in ∼15% of patients within 15 years (Figure 8).263,377 
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty may be rarely considered as a bridge to 
TAVI or SAVR in carefully selected patients with decompensated AS, 
and in those with severe AS who require urgent high-risk non-cardiac 
surgery (NCS) (see Section 15.2.1). The procedure carries significant 
risks of acute complications.379 
A substantial increase in the number of patients undergoing AV intervention has been observed over the past decade as a consequence of the 
introduction of TAVI, improved diagnostic techniques, and evolving indications for intervention.374,380–383 Nevertheless, there is still wide variation in worldwide access to TAVI as a result of high device costs in 
comparison with surgical prostheses and variation in healthcare resources and reimbursement systems between countries.384–386 In addition, registries suggest that late referral and undertreatment remain 
frequent.12,387 
8.5.1. The mode of intervention in candidates for a 
bioprosthesis 
The two modes of BHV replacement, TAVI and SAVR, have been compared in RCTs across the spectrum of surgical risk in predominantly 
elderly patients with tricuspid AS. 
In patients unsuitable for surgery, TAVI was superior to medical 
therapy with a number-needed-to-treat of five to prevent one death 
at 1-year follow-up.388 Subsequently, RCTs showed non-inferiority of 
TAVI compared with SAVR in patients at high,389–391 intermediate,3,392,393 and low surgical risk,1,394,395 with comparable longer-term 
outcomes demonstrated during follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 
10 years.2,4,396–398 Of note, the majority of patients included in 
RCTs were male, while patients with low-flow low-gradient AS or adverse anatomical characteristics (including BAVs or complex CAD) 
were excluded per protocol. 
Meta-analyses of RCTs show a risk reduction in all-cause death and 
disabling stroke with TAVI in low-risk patients at 1 year, but no differences to SAVR at longer-term follow-up or in patients at intermediate 
or high surgical risk.399,400 The early benefit of TAVI in low-risk patients 
has since been corroborated in the investigator-initiated Randomized, 
Multicenter, Event-Driven Trial of TAVI vs SAVR in Patients with 
Symptomatic Severe Aortic-Valve Stenosis (DEDICATE), which met 
its non-inferiority target with a composite of death and stroke rate at 
1 year of 5.4% in the TAVI group vs 10.0% in the SAVR group [hazard 
ratio (HR), 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35–0.79] and all- 
cause death rates of 2.6% and 6.2% (HR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24–0.73), 
respectively.395 
Rates of vascular complications and paravalvular leak (PVL) are consistently higher after TAVI despite refined transcatheter heart valve 
(THV) designs, whereas severe bleeding, acute kidney injury, and new- 
onset AF are more frequent after SAVR.2,4,399,401 Even though PVL has 
been associated with adverse clinical outcomes,402,403 it does not seem 
to impact the comparison of clinical outcomes between TAVI and 
SAVR in RCTs.2,4,395 
New pacemaker implantations are more frequent after TAVI, particularly when using self-expanding valves.3,394,404 Conflicting data exist 
regarding the long-term impact of new pacemaker implantation or 
new-onset left bundle branch block following AV intervention.405–407 
Patients undergoing TAVI have quicker recoveries, shorter hospital

stays, and more rapid improvements in quality of life compared with 
those who undergo SAVR.1,2,408,409 
Available data do not suggest systematic differences in durability between the two treatment modalities. Randomized controlled trials and 
observational studies have reported comparable rates of BHV failure related to SVD with transcatheter and surgical valves up to 10 years.2,398,410 
However, potential selection and survival bias, the use of variable definitions of SVD, limited follow-up durations, differential attrition 
rates,2,4,396,400 competing risk of death, and the use of multiple valve 
types in the surgical arms of RCTs may limit direct comparison.411 
Although conclusive evidence is still lacking, concomitant non- 
complex CAD can be addressed either by CABG or PCI, while 
complex CAD favours CABG (see Section 6.1). In the only RCT comparing these two strategies, the transcatheter valve and vessels 
(TCW) trial, randomization of patients with severe AS and concomitant CAD to FFR-guided PCI plus TAVI resulted in fewer deaths and 
major bleeding events compared with combined SAVR plus CABG at 
12 months.412 However, inferences from trial results are limited due 
to early termination, modest sample sizes, event rates deviating from 
those observed in registries and other RCTs, and a low prevalence of 
complex CAD. 
8.5.1.1. Age and life expectancy 
The relationship between estimated life expectancy and prosthetic heart 
valve durability determines the likelihood of a future reintervention. 
Although life expectancy may be a theoretically better guide than age 
alone for treatment decisions, it is difficult to estimate for an individual patient owing to large geographical (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ 
ihme-data/gbd-2019-life-tables-1950-2019) and interindividual variability.413 In combination with cardiac and extracardiac comorbidities, as 
well as anatomical factors, age contributes to risk estimation and represents a pragmatic surrogate for life expectancy. In addition, age thresholds 
characterize the populations enrolled in RCTs better than life expectancy. 
It is notable that younger patients with AS seem to have lower life expectancy than the general population despite valve replacement, whereas life 
expectancy almost normalizes after treatment in older cohorts.414,415 
While several trials compared TAVI with SAVR in study populations 
aged 70–85 years accross the surgical risk spectrum, the representation 
of patients aged <70 years in RCTs is low and therefore evidence 
limited.1,394,395,416 
8.5.1.2. Anatomical features 
The advantages of TAVI demonstrated in RCTs are largely confined to 
patients treated via the transfemoral approach.401 While SAVR remains 
the preferred treatment option when iliofemoral artery disease precludes transfemoral TAVI, TAVI via a non-transfemoral access (transaxillary, transcarotid, transcaval, transinnominate, or transapical) 
constitutes an alternative supported by observational data in patients 
unsuitable for surgery.417–423 
Other anatomical factors that favour SAVR or led to exclusion of patients from RCTs comparing TAVI with SAVR are  (Figure 9): 
• Aortic annular dimensions that lie outside sizing recommendations 
for currently available transcatheter devices. 
• Excessive or bulky calcifications of the annulus or LVOT, which increase the risk of PVL and annular rupture.424,425 
• Increased risk of coronary obstruction with TAVI (cusp height greater 
than coronary height in combination with shallow sinuses of Valsalva, 
or high calcium burden of corresponding cusp).329 
In contrast, anatomical findings such as porcelain aorta, severe chest 
deformation, or intact grafts post-CABG favour TAVI. Right anterior 
thoracotomy or upper hemisternotomy are minimally invasive access 
alternatives to sternotomy for performing SAVR, which are being 
used with increasing frequency.426,427 
In BAV patients, severe AS usually occurs earlier compared with tricuspid AV and is frequently associated with aortopathy.219,281,428 
Prevalence of BAV anatomy sharply increases in younger AS patients.429 BAV anatomy adds complexity to TAVI because of asymmetric AV calcification and elliptical annular shape, as well as the lack of 
standardization of valve sizing. 
Patients with BAV have been excluded from almost all landmark 
RCTs comparing TAVI with SAVR to date.429,430 In the NOTION 2 
trial, the composite of all-cause death, stroke, or valve- or HF-related 
rehospitalization was numerically more frequent (seven vs two events) 
at 1 year in the underpowered subgroup of 100 patients with BAV (HR, 
3.8; 95% CI, 0.8–18.5; P = 0.07).416 Whereas some observational studies 
report favourable outcomes with TAVI in selected BAV patients,430–432 
others suggest higher stroke, annular rupture, and PVL rates as compared with TAVI in tricuspid AS.433 Heavy cusp calcification, particularly 
in conjunction with a calcified raphe, is associated with increased risk 
of aortic root injury, PVL, and mortality after TAVI.434 Data on TAVI 
in two-sinus BAV (Sievers type 0) are scarce.219,435 
For the above-mentioned reasons, SAVR remains the primary mode 
of treatment for stenotic BAV, particularly if patients are young or have 
coexistent aortopathy or unfavourable valve morphology. TAVI may be 
considered in patients at increased surgical risk, if anatomy is suitable. 
Patients with small annuli in relation to their body stature are at increased risk of prosthesis–patient mismatch (PPM) after valve replacement. Annular enlargement allows for implantation of larger BHVs 
with SAVR. Given its technical complexity it should be performed 
in experienced centres, and the benefit must be balanced against a 
possibly higher risk of operative mortality.436 Prostheses with 
supra-annular design reduce PPM risk with TAVI, although randomized 
long-term data evaluating the impact on clinical outcomes or valve 
durability are pending.394,437,438 
8.5.1.3. Lifetime management 
Decision-making concerning the mode of intervention and type of 
prosthesis needs to integrate expected valve durability, and the potential risks of future reinterventions (Figure 9). Surgical THV explantation 
followed by SAVR is a rare (<1% of all TAVI procedures) but technically 
challenging procedure.439–441 Although its incidence among patients 
undergoing TAVI is stable, absolute numbers are increasing due to 
the total increase in TAVI procedures performed and the peri- 
operative risk remains high (early mortality rates as high as 12%– 
17%).440–445 The majority of surgical THV explantations are performed 
in patients at high surgical risk with urgent or emergent, 
non-SVD-related indication for reintervention (frequently endocarditis) within 2 years after TAVI.440,442–444 
Implanting a transcatheter aortic valve inside a surgical (TAV-in-SAV) 
or prior transcatheter valve (TAV-in-TAV) is associated with lower 
peri-procedural risk compared with redo SAVR.446–451 However, 
valve-in-valve implantation (particularly TAV-in-SAV) increases the 
risk of severe PPM,448 which has been linked to adverse outcomes in 
observational studies.452–455 In addition, valve-in-valve implantation immobilizes the leaflets of the failed prosthesis in an open position, creating a covered tube (or neo-skirt) that may cause direct coronary 
obstruction in patients with shallow sinuses of Valsalva or indirect


<!-- PAGE 35 -->

### Page 35

coronary flow obstruction as a result of sinus sequestration if the ascending aorta is narrow and the neo-skirt reaches the sinotubular 
junction.456,457 
The risk of coronary obstruction varies considerably depending on 
the index valve type, and is particularly increased if a stentless SAV or 
stented SAV with externally mounted leaflets is in place.457 The risk 
of sinus sequestration at the time of TAV-in-TAV implantation is particularly increased in supra-annular valves with a high neo-skirt.458,459 
Even if coronary flow is preserved, coronary access may be difficult 
or impossible in a relevant proportion of patients after valve-in-valve 
implantation, especially after TAV-in-TAV.460–462 
In patients who require a reintervention due to dysfunction of a surgical or transcatheter bioprosthesis, but are at increased risk of severe 
PPM or coronary obstruction, redo SAVR may be preferable despite 
the increased surgical risk. Fracture of surgical valves and leaflet modification techniques have been proposed for patients at high surgical risk 
and, if contemplated, should be performed in carefully selected patients 
at experienced centres (Table 6).463,464 
The need for a meticulous CT-based anatomical analysis is paramount in patients with an estimated life expectancy exceeding the 
assumed valve durability to anticipate future risks at the time of 
the index valve intervention. Based on individual assessment, the 
following measures should be considered with respect to lifetime 
management: 
• Use of surgical and transcatheter valves with proven long-term durability to reduce the likelihood of reintervention.2,4,375,410,411,465–467 
• SAVR with aortic root enlargement or implantation of a supra-annular 
transcatheter valve in patients with a small annulus at risk of severe 
PPM based on the predicted effective orifice area (EOA).436,438,468,469 
• No implantation of stentless prostheses or prostheses with externally mounted leaflets in patients at risk of coronary obstruction during 
future TAV-in-SAV implantation.457

• Anticipation of the feasibility and risks of a possible future TAV-in-TAV 
procedure considering related technical aspects at the index TAVI 
(device choice, neo-skirt height, commissural alignment, and implantation depth).456,470  
Considering life-time management aspects and the scarcity of randomized data in patients younger than 70 years, SAVR remains the preferred treatment in patients <70 years of age if surgical risk is low. 
TAVI is recommended as the primary treatment modality in elderly patients ≥70 years of age with a tricuspid AV, if anatomy is suitable and 
transfemoral access is feasible, to reduce the risk of early adverse outcomes and accelerate recovery. 
For all other candidates for a bioprosthesis, the most appropriate 
mode of intervention should be carefully selected by the Heart 
Team, taking into account procedural risk based on anatomical characteristics and comorbidities, expected outcomes, lifetime management 
considerations, and patient preference (Figure 9; Recommendation 
Table 4). Recommendations for concomitant valve replacement at 
the time of CABG or ascending aortic surgery are listed in

8.6. Follow-up 
The rate of progression of AS varies widely and asymptomatic patients, 
their family, and medical caregivers need careful education, with particular emphasis on the importance of regular follow-up (ideally at a Heart 
Valve Centre)14 and prompt reporting of symptoms. Asymptomatic patients with severe AS should be followed up at least every 6 months to 
allow detection of early symptoms (using exercise testing if complaints 
are inconclusive) and any change in echocardiographic parameters (particularly LVEF). Serial measurements of natriuretic peptides can provide 
additional useful information regarding the timing of treatment. 
Younger patients with mild AS and no significant leaflet calcification 
may be followed up every 2–3 years. With increasing stenosis severity, 
progression accelerates and follow-up intervals should be gradually reduced.283,503 Several studies suggest that the prognosis of moderate degenerative AS is worse than previously considered,504,505 particularly if 
there is significant valve calcification, and these patients should be re- 
evaluated at least annually. 
Cardiac rehabilitation is frequently performed after AV intervention, 
especially after surgery and in elderly patients, and is associated with improved activities of daily living and 6-minute walking distance.506 After 
valve intervention, an early echocardiographic examination within the 
first weeks after valve replacement is recommended to document baseline prosthetic valve function. Cardiological evaluations and echocardiographic examinations are recommended annually in patients with a 
bioprosthesis, and whenever changes in clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of valve dysfunction are noted. 
9. Mitral regurgitation 
Chronic MR is one of the most common acquired valve pathologies,12,187 while acute MR is observed in the context of infective endocarditis, chordal rupture, or as a complication of myocardial infarction 
(papillary muscle rupture). MR either relates to anatomical changes of 
the MV apparatus (primary), or to LV or LA dilatation and dysfunction 
(secondary).193 Since natural history, prognosis, and management differ 
according to aetiologies, populations should be clearly distinguished in 
clinical practice and research.12,507 
9.1. Primary mitral regurgitation 
9.1.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Primary mitral regurgitation relates to an anatomical lesion of one or 
more of the three main components (not including the annulus) of the 
MV apparatus (valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles). 
PMR is observed in 55% of patients with MR who require treatment.507 
While degenerative disease related to fibroelastic deficiency or myxomatous alterations (in its most severe form, Barlow’s disease) are the most 
common aetiologies in higher-income countries, RHD is most frequently 
found in the rest of the world. MV endocarditis is a separate entity of PMR 
caused by acute or chronic infectious conditions and is discussed in the 
corresponding Guidelines.5 In a small subgroup of patients, PMR is associated with a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death has been reported in individual cases, especially in patients with 
Barlow’s disease.508 The arrhythmogenic burden is independent from MR 
severity and has been associated with mitral annular disjunction. Atrial displacement of the posterior MV leaflet hinge point is assumed to cause excessive mobility of the valvular apparatus and increases tension on the 
papillary muscles and the posterobasal myocardium, causing local fibrosis, 
which may lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.509 
9.1.2. Evaluation 
9.1.2.1. Echocardiography and right heart catheterization 
Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice for the quantification of MR, determination of its aetiology, and identification of cardiac 
consequences (Figure 10). TTE is used for initial evaluation that includes: 
(i) assessment of valve morphology (presence and location of prolapse 
or flail, calcifications, and/or mitral annular disjunction); (ii) integrative 
severity grading; and (iii) quantification of LV and LA dimensions and 
function, as well as assessment of concomitant RV dysfunction.46 
Quantitative parameters such as the effective regurgitant orifice area 
(EROA) have prognostic implications.510,511 Volumetric methods provide additional information on MR severity [RVol and regurgitant fraction (RF)].512 Accurate colour flow settings must be used to avoid 
overestimation of MR severity. 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) represents the method of 
choice to assess valve anatomy, leaflet quality, motion, and coaptation, as 
well as to confirm MR severity.513 Three-dimensional TOE provides an 
excellent morphological and functional view of the different valve segments, and should be used systematically when planning and performing 
surgical or transcatheter repair.514 
Exercise echocardiography evaluates dynamic changes in regurgitant jet 
and pulmonary pressures during peak exercise, and might be helpful in patients with discordant symptoms and regurgitation severity at rest.515,516 
In asymptomatic patients with severe PMR, increased LV or LA dimensions, as well as elevated pulmonary pressures (>50 mmHg at 
rest), moderate or more secondary TR, and AF are important markers 
of worse prognosis, and should be considered for intervention timing 
(Figure 11; Section 9.1.4).517,518 
Right heart catheterization remains important in patients with PMR 
for confirmation of pulmonary artery pressures in case of discrepancy 
between echocardiographic MR severity and clinical symptoms, as well 
as in the presence of concomitant lung disease.519 
9.1.2.2. Biomarkers 
Cardiac biomarkers are recognized indicators of disease 
severity with prognostic implications, but may also be non- 
specific. NT-proBNP levels are directly related to the 
New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in PMR.520

In a multicentre registry including more than 1300 patients with PMR, 
increased BNP level was an independent predictor of long-term mortality under medical treatment. However, pre-operative BNP activation 
did not impact long-term mortality after surgical treatment.96 
9.1.2.3. Cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography 
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is an alternative to precisely quantify RVol and RF in cases of inconclusive or discordant measurements, 
and the gold standard to determine cardiac dimensions and chamber 
volumes.521,522 The combination of planimetered volumetric methods 
and phase contrast measurement of the MV inflow are used for this 
purpose.523 In patients with Barlow’s disease and mitral annular disjunction, CMR-detected myocardial fibrosis524 has been associated with 
ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.525 
Cardiac computed tomography provides high-resolution anatomical 
details of the entire MV apparatus523,526 and increasingly plays a role in 
MV intervention planning, particularly in the assessment of arterial access 
for extracorporeal circulation and the presence of MV calcification in minimally invasive surgery,527 as well as the feasibility of transcatheter MV implantation (TMVI) based on annulus size and risk of LVOT obstruction.528

Due its high sensitivity for detection of calcifications, CCT is instrumental for procedural planning (surgical and transcatheter) in patients 
with MAC.529 
9.1.2.4. Genetic evaluation 
There is increasing evidence that specific mitral pathologies may be associated with genetic conditions. A meta-analysis of six genome-wide 
association studies identified 14 potential genetic loci associated with 
primary MR. By comprising epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic 
data, the following genes could be identified as potential genetic sources 
of the pathology: LMCD1, SPTBN1, LTBP2, TGFB2, NMB, and ALPK3.530 
However, genetic testing is not recommended in routine practice. 
9.1.3. Medical therapy 
Medical therapy has a limited role in patients with PMR. Afterload reduction with sodium nitroprusside has been used as a bridge to an 
intervention in patients with acute severe PMR without signs of hypotension. Inotropic agents and diuretics are usually indicated to reduce 
filling pressures and control pulmonary congestion, while the implantation of an intra-aortic balloon pump helps to further reduce afterload 
in exceptional cases of acute PMR. 
In chronic PMR without signs of LV dysfunction or criteria for an 
intervention, there is no evidence supporting prophylactic afterload reduction. Patients with PMR and impaired LV function should receive 
GDMT according to HF Guidelines.340 
9.1.4. Indications for intervention 
Urgent surgery or transcatheter treatment is indicated in patients with 
acute severe PMR because it is poorly haemodynamically tolerated. In patients with papillary muscle rupture and endocarditis, surgical valve replacement is generally required, while acute degenerative chordal rupture can be 
treated with surgical MV repair or TEER in high-risk patients. 
Indications for surgery in patients with chronic asymptomatic and 
symptomatic PMR are summarized in Recommendation Table 6 and  
Figure 11. In cases of severe PMR, restoring the anatomy by surgical 
MV repair, including annuloplasty, is the treatment of choice in operable 
patients when an optimal and durable result is expected. According 
to contemporary data, the procedure can be performed with 
a low mortality risk (1.2%) in appropriately selected patients.531 
Compared with replacement, MV repair has been associated with 
lower peri-operative mortality along with significantly better long- 
term survival and functional outcomes.532,533 Repair of more complex pathologies such as valves with annular or leaflet calcifications, 
as well as in cases of RHD, is challenging and should be attempted in 
experienced Heart Valve Centres.534–536 When MV repair is not 
feasible, valve replacement with preservation of the subvalvular apparatus should be performed.537 
High-risk and elderly patients with chronic PMR, though uncommon, 
may benefit from a less-invasive M-TEER procedure.538 Peri- 
interventional and mid-term results with regard to residual MR and 
mean transmitral gradient are closely related to patient outcomes.538 
The use of latest-generation devices along with a growing team experience have improved results, and allow for the successful treatment 
of more complex anatomical conditions (Supplementary data online,  
Table S2).539,540 The decision regarding the mode of intervention or 
conservative treatment should be made by the Heart Team, considering 
clinical and anatomical characteristics, as well as procedural risks and 
patient preference. The longer-term efficacy of TEER compared with 
surgery is still under investigation in high- (NCT03271762) and 
intermediate-risk PMR patients (NCT04198870), as well as in 
all-risk-category patients >60 years of age (NCT05051033).541 TMVI 
is very effective in abolishing MR in selected high-risk patients, particularly those with complex MV anatomy for TEER (Supplementary data 
online, Table S2).542,543 The major drawbacks of current TMVI systems 
include limited availability, high screening failure rate, as well as the risk of 
LVOT obstruction and valve thrombosis. Limited data exist for PMR patients and regarding mid-term prosthesis durability. 
In patients with asymptomatic PMR with signs of LV dysfunction 
(i.e. LVEF ≤60%, LVESD ≥40 mm, or LVESDi ≥20 mm/m2) the benefit of early surgery is well established.544–546 Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the presence of LA dilatation [LA volume index 
(LAVI) ≥60 mL/m2 or LA diameter ≥55 mm], AF, systolic pulmonary 
artery pressure (SPAP) at rest of >50 mmHg, and concomitant moderate or severe secondary TR are associated with worse long-term 
prognosis irrespective of LV function after corrective surgery, and 
should therefore prompt referral in low-risk patients, particularly if 
a high probability of MV repair is expected.517,518,547 A recent study 
showed that women have a higher risk of long-term mortality after 
MV repair than men, even at lower degrees of ventricular dilatation 
and dysfunction, suggesting the potential usefulness of sex-specific indexed thresholds.548 Ventricular arrhythmias in patients with MV prolapse have been linked to impaired prognosis and possibly sudden 
cardiac death, especially in the presence of mitral annular disjunction.549–551 Ring annuloplasty stabilizes the posterior annulus, reduces 
traction on the subvalvular apparatus,552 and may lower the risk of arrhythmias.553 Minimally invasive surgery via right mini-thoracotomy is 
used with increasing frequency in experienced centres.554–556 A recent RCT demonstrated similar safety and efficacy compared with 
conventional sternotomy. Mini-thoracotomy was associated with 
shorter hospital stay and improved physical activity within the first 
6 weeks after surgery, a difference that disappeared at 12 weeks.557 
The use of minimally invasive MV surgery may therefore be considered to reduce hospital stay and accelerate recovery in experienced 
centres. However, in a national registry, these benefits were less 
clear.558

9.1.5. Follow-up 
Asymptomatic patients with severe MR not fulfilling the criteria for an 
intervention, and with documented preserved exercise capacity, should 
undergo clinical and echocardiographic follow-up twice per year (watchful waiting strategy), ideally in the setting of a Heart Valve Clinic.568 
Follow-up may also include serial measurements of BNP levels, electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or Holter monitoring, and (in selected cases) exercise echocardiography and CMR to confirm MR severity, and cardiac 
chamber function and dimensions.46 Asymptomatic patients with moderate MR and preserved LV function can be followed on a yearly basis 
with echocardiographic assessment every 1 or 2 years. 
The frequency of follow-up after an intervention depends on the type 
of procedure performed. Very good long-term durability of MV repair in 
PMR due to valve prolapse with a low recurrence rate has been reported 
at experienced centres with freedom from moderate or severe MR of 
87.5% at 20 years.533,559 Serial clinical and echocardiographic follow-up 
in patients without pre-operative LV dysfunction or rhythm abnormalities every 2–3 years thereafter is sufficient. Patients with atrial or ventricular arrhythmias possibly related to MV disease should be further 
evaluated using continuous ECG monitoring. Patients with recurrent 
MR after surgical ring annuloplasty frequently undergo repeat surgery 
(usually MV replacement), while transcatheter alternatives are reserved 
for selected high-risk patients because of the risk of increased gradients 
(M-TEER), PVL, and LVOT obstruction (mitral valve-in-ring procedures).569,570 In patients undergoing MV replacement, closer follow-up 
on a yearly basis is required due to the risk of prosthetic valve dysfunction 
or SVD (see Section 14.4). Following TEER, reported rates of residual MR 
and increased transmitral gradients are higher than after surgical repair, 
suggesting that yearly follow-up is appropriate.571 Although rare, the 
need for surgical treatment after failed TEER is associated with increased 
peri-operative mortality and low valve repair rates,541,572 while transcatheter solutions to detach TEER implants and replace the valve have 
been described in few cases.573,574 
9.2. Secondary mitral regurgitation 
9.2.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Secondary mitral regurgitation is present when the MV structure appears 
grossly normal but the MV is nonetheless incompetent, due to alterations 
in LV and LA geometry, dyssynchrony, and imbalances between MV closing and tethering forces.575 The prevalence of severe SMR in patients with 
chronic HF is ∼10% and higher in patients with reduced vs preserved LVEF 
(25% vs 4%).576 Secondary mitral regurgitation can be classified as atrial or 
ventricular with different pathophysiological and morphological characteristics, as well as contrasting prognostic and therapeutic implications.577 
Ventricular SMR is more common and associated with worse long-term 
prognosis.513,578–580 Dilated or ischaemic cardiomyopathy are the most 
frequent causes of severe ventricular SMR. Acute HF exacerbation may 
occur in patients with chronic HF due to a renewed ischaemic event, arrhythmia, infection, or volume overload. Atrial SMR is due to pure mitral 
annular dilation and is observed in patients with long-standing AF and/or 
HFpEF.581 Factors predisposing to atrial SMR include age ≥65 years, female sex, LA dilatation, and diastolic dysfunction.582 From a morphological 
point of view, ventricular SMR is characterized by leaflet tethering and restricted motion combined with annular dilation, while annulus enlargement and flattening leading to planar coaptation are predominantly 
observed in atrial SMR. The prevalence of atrial SMR has been underestimated in the past and was occasionally misclassified as PMR due to 
pseudo-prolapse with leaflet tethering in advanced stages. 
9.2.2. Evaluation 
Echocardiographic criteria to define significant SMR according to aetiology are reported in Figure 10. Importantly, SMR assessment should 
be performed after optimization of medical therapy and in a euvolaemic 
and normotensive state. When quantifying EROA and RVol in SMR, 
lower thresholds may apply to define severe regurgitation because of 
the potential elliptical regurgitant orifice and/or the low-flow state. 
An EROA of ≥30 mm2 and/or an RVol of ≥45 mL has been identified 
as having a significant impact on outcomes,45 with prognosis improved 
after treatment.583,584 Cardiac magnetic resonance is used to confirm 
SMR severity and assess cardiac chamber function and dimensions. 
The extent of myocardial fibrosis, as assessed with CMR, has been associated with poor prognosis.585 Owing to the dynamic nature of SMR, 
exercise echocardiography may help to identify patients with severe 
SMR when values at rest are inconclusive.45 
9.2.3. Definition of atrial secondary mitral 
regurgitation 
Characteristics distinguishing between atrial and ventricular SMR are 
displayed in Figure 12. 
Surgical MV repair is recommended in low-risk 
asymptomatic patients with severe PMR without LV 
dysfunction (LVESD <40 mm, LVESDi <20 mm/m2, 
and LVEF >60%) when a durable result is likely, if at 
least three of the following criteria are 
fulfilled:517,547,562–564

Atrial SMR is most frequently defined by the presence of the following key criteria:513,578–580,586–590 
• preserved LVEF (≥50%) without regional wall motion abnormalities 
or leaflet tethering; AND 
• no or mildly dilated LV cavity [LV end-diastolic dimension of <56 mm 
in women and <63 mm in men; indexed LV end-diastolic volume of 
<71 mL/m2 (in women) or <79 mL/m2 (in men)]; AND 
• mitral annulus (MA) dilatation [anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 
>35 mm]; AND 
• enlarged LA (LAVI >34 mL/m2).  
Echocardiography frequently reveals normal leaflet motion with planar coaptation, and normal leaflet morphology with a central MR jet in 
atrial SMR. However, at advanced stages, an overlap between atrial and 
ventricular SMR criteria can be observed in the case of late LV damage 
due to continuous volume overload.591,592 Clinical criteria (i.e. history 
of AF and/or diagnosis of HFpEF) are also useful and should be taken 
into consideration. 
9.2.4. Management of ventricular secondary mitral  
regurgitation 
9.2.4.1. Medical and device therapy 
In patients with ventricular SMR, GDMT for the treatment of HF is recommended prior to any MV intervention.339,340 The combination of 
ACE-Is/ARBs or angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors, beta- 
blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium–glucose 
co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) at the maximum tolerated doses 
is recommended according to the HF Guidelines.340 Initiation and up- 
titration of neurohormonal drugs need to be tailored according to 
the patient profile, mainly based on BP, heart rate, potassium levels, 
and renal function.593 Notably, GDMT up-titration must be rapid (within 6 weeks) and take place in the context of close follow-up visits, especially in the case of a recent hospitalization for acute HF.594 About 
40% of patients with ventricular SMR experience improvement of 
SMR severity after 1–3 months of optimized GDMT.595,596 Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) should also be considered as part of HF 
management before an MV intervention according to HF guideline criteria (LVEF ≤35% and wide QRS).597,598 Although no dedicated RCTs

exist, SMR reduction by at least one grade has been described in 40%– 
60% of patients and is associated with reverse LV remodelling and improved clinical outcomes.597,599,600 
9.2.4.2. Indications for intervention 
The management of patients with ventricular SMR should be discussed 
by a multidisciplinary Heart Team including HF specialists. The indication for intervention is based on the persistence of symptoms (i.e. 
NYHA class II–V) despite adequate GDMT and CRT, if indicated 
(Figure 13). GDMT is the only option for very frail patients or those 
with limited life expectancy. 
In the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip 
Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional 
Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT) trial, M-TEER was shown to be safe 
and reduced recurrent HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality 
at 2 and 5 years of follow-up, compared with optimized GDMT 
in patients with ventricular SMR without relevant CAD.583,584

Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation, MITRA-FR), no differences were demonstrated for the combined primary endpoint of all- 
cause mortality or HF hospitalization at 1 and 2 years.601,602 These diverging results might be explained by effect sizes of the trials, differences 
in trial design, patient selection and follow-up, echocardiographic assessment of SMR severity, use of GDMT, and technical factors.603–605 A 
third RCT, the Randomized Investigation of the MitraClip Device in 
Heart Failure: 2nd Trial in Patients with Clinically Significant 
Functional Mitral Regurgitation (RESHAPE-HF-2) trial showed a 36% 
reduction in the rates of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death 
at 2 years in the intervention arm driven by reduction of first or recurrent HF hospitalization. When considered in isolation, cardiovascular 
mortality was not significantly reduced during the observation period. 
In addition, there was a significant improvement in quality of life as 
measured by the KCCQ overall score (mean difference between study 
groups, 10.9 points; 95% CI, 6.8–15.0; P <0.001).606 A recent study-level 
meta-analysis of these three trials showed a significant reduction of HF 
rehospitalization at 24 months (HR, 0.63, 95% CI, 0.50–0.80) and the 
composite of death and all-cause hospitalizations (HR, 0.72, 95% CI, 
0.51–0.999).607 However, there was no statistically significant difference 
in death from any cause or cardiovascular death at 24 months. 
Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is therefore recommended to reduce HF hospitalizations, and improve quality of life, in symptomatic patients with persisting severe SMR despite optimized GDMT fulfilling 
specific clinical and echocardiographic criteria (Table 7). Although less 
challenging than in PMR, anatomical suitability for TEER needs to be assessed upfront (Supplementary data online, Table S2). There is also increasing observational evidence supporting the use of TEER for the 
improvement of symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with ventricular SMR not fulfilling the clinical and echocardiographic criteria for outcome improvement.608–612 This particularly 
applies to patients not tolerating GDMT in whom TEER may help up- 
titration, as well as those with recent myocardial infarction and persistent severe ventricular SMR.203,613 
Transcatheter implantation of an indirect annuloplasty device into 
the coronary sinus has been proposed as an alternative that preserves 
valve integrity. Despite rather modest SMR reduction (22.4% decrease 
in mitral RVol) and no significant effect on quality of life in a small sham- 
controlled RCT, symptomatic improvement and reverse remodelling 
were observed in registries at 1 year.614,615 Heart transplantation or 
left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation should be considered 
in selected patients with severe ventricular SMR and advanced HF. 
In patients with ventricular SMR without relevant CAD, indications 
for isolated MV surgery are restrictive owing to procedural risks and 
the absence of proven mortality benefit.616 The Multicenter, 
Randomized, Controlled Study to Assess Mitral Valve Reconstruction 
for Advanced Insufficiency of Functional or Ischemic Origin 
(MATTERHORN) trial, which included a mixed population mainly composed of patients with ventricular SMR (84%), demonstrated that TEER 
is non-inferior to surgical repair or replacement with regard to a composite endpoint of death, HF hospitalization, MV reintervention, implantation of an assist device, or stroke within 1 year after the 
procedure, and showed a better safety profile.617 In patients with severe ischaemic ventricular SMR and concomitant CAD requiring coronary revascularization, MV surgery at the time of CABG is 
recommended, unless the patient is at high surgical risk and/or the coronary anatomy is suitable for PCI. Although isolated undersized mitral 
annuloplasty is the most commonly performed MV repair procedure, 
recurrent MR rates were high with this technique in an RCT618 and reverse LV remodelling is limited, especially in patients with an increased 
tenting area (>1.35 cm2/m2 BSA),619 in whom MV replacement is usually required.620 The addition of subvalvular modification in patients 
with LV dilatation and pronounced MV leaflet tenting may improve results for MV repair,621 but durability and impact on HF symptoms with 
this technique require further investigation. 
The treatment of moderate ischaemic SMR in patients undergoing 
CABG remains controversial. Meta-analyses, including four RCTs comparing CABG with concomitant MV surgery vs CABG alone, have 
shown lower rates of recurrent MR but no benefit in terms of mortality 
and clinical outcomes.622–624 Therefore, clinical decision-making should 
weigh peri-operative risks of more complex surgery against the long- 
term risk of MR progression. 
9.2.4.3. Follow-up 
Patients with ventricular SMR need to be followed up carefully after 
intervention by an HF specialist, because they remain at increased 
risk of events despite intervention. The 5-year cumulative incidence 
of all-cause death or HF hospitalization was 73.6% in the device arm 
of the COAPT study.584 Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic 
evaluation every 3 or 6 months, according to the HF stage, is recommended. Durability of the procedural result, as well as congestion status 
and the need for further GDMT optimization facilitated by SMR reduction,613 need to be assessed. Patients and families should be trained in 
monitoring vital signs, body weight, and HF symptoms to avoid late hospital admissions and facilitate management of possible decompensation. 
Also, patients must be educated on the importance of not discontinuing 
medical therapies after intervention since the two treatments (devices 
and drugs) are complementary. 
Patients with ventricular SMR, who are asymptomatic and/or have 
moderate or dynamic MR, should undergo clinical and echocardiographic follow-up at least twice per year.

9.2.5. Management of atrial secondary mitral 
regurgitation 
9.2.5.1. Medical therapy and rhythm management 
In patients with atrial SMR, underlying causes need to be recognized and 
treated. Associated HFpEF and AF should be managed according to the 
relevant Guidelines.7,340 The use of SGLT2is should be encouraged in 
patients with HFpEF due to their proven efficacy in reducing cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization.625 Limited data show that rhythm 
control may contribute to reduce atrial SMR severity and reverse LA 
dilatation.626 
9.2.5.2. Indications for intervention 
Registry data demonstrate that patients with atrial SMR are typically 
elderly with associated AF. Mitral valve surgery has been recently associated with lower rates of HF hospitalizations and mortality compared 
with GDMT in a matched population, despite a higher risk profile in the 
surgical arm at baseline.627 Data from several observational studies also 
suggest that surgical annuloplasty is effective and durable in patients with 
atrial SMR, because it counteracts the main mechanism of MR progression.628–630 Its combination with surgical AF ablation (Maze procedure) 
and concomitant LAAO may have further advantages,630,631 while the frequently associated relevant TR can also be addressed during the same procedure.627 Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair may also be considered 
because observational studies have demonstrated high safety and procedural success,588–590,632,633 as well as compared with surgery in a small subgroup (n = 34) of the MATTERHORN RCT.634 However, the risk of 
increased gradient due to planar leaflet coaptation, large regurgitant jet, 
and limited MV area (MVA) needs to be taken into consideration.592,635 
Further studies are warranted to investigate the treatment modalities of 
patients with atrial SMR. 
9.2.5.3. Follow-up 
Patients with atrial SMR undergoing surgical or transcatheter intervention should be followed up on a yearly basis, including clinical and echocardiographic evaluation. In cases of HFpEF, as an underlying cause of 
atrial SMR, consultation with an HF specialist is necessary. 
Asymptomatic patients with severe atrial SMR not fulfilling the criteria for an intervention should undergo clinical and echocardiographic 
follow-up at least once per year. 
10. Mitral stenosis 
10.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
The aetiology of MS is most frequently rheumatic or degenerative, 
while rare forms can be drug-induced, inflammatory, or 
carcinoid-related. Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of 
MS and death due to VHD worldwide. Its prevalence has decreased 
in high- and middle-income countries, but remains a major healthcare problem in low-income countries, where it predominantly 
affects young patients.12,187,644 Degenerative MS related to MAC 
is 
a 
distinct 
age-dependent 
pathology 
requiring 
different 
treatment strategies.645–647 Both aetiologies are more frequent in 
females.648 
10.2. Rheumatic mitral stenosis 
10.2.1. Evaluation 
Echocardiography is the preferred method for screening in endemic regions and the assessment of the severity, extent of anatomical lesions, 
and haemodynamic consequences of MS. Involvement of other valves, 
particularly secondary TR, should be identified. Mitral valve area using

2D planimetry is the most commonly used measurement to assess 
stenosis severity, but 3D TTE and TOE have additional diagnostic 
value.649 An MVA of ≤1.5 cm2 in conjunction with clinical factors 
(symptoms, high risk of thromboembolism, or haemodynamic decompensation) is indicative of clinically severe MS. Mean transvalvular gradient and pulmonary pressures reflect its consequences and have 
prognostic value.649,650 Leaflet thickening and fibrosis, along with commissural fusion and shortening of the subvalvular apparatus, are the 
most important pathomechanisms of stenosis associated with RHD. 
The presence and extent of leaflet and subvalvular calcifications influence treatment decisions. Scoring systems have been developed to assess the suitability of patients for percutaneous mitral commissurotomy 
(PMC) (see Supplementary data online, Table S3).651–653 
Exercise testing is indicated in asymptomatic patients or patients 
with symptoms that are equivocal or discordant with the severity of 
stenosis. Exercise echocardiography provides additional information 
on exercise capacity and related changes in mitral gradient and pulmonary artery pressure, and is preferred over DSE, especially when there 
are contraindications to dobutamine.654 Transoesophageal echocardiography should be systematically performed in PMC candidates to exclude LA thrombus or after an embolic episode, and may play an 
essential role for procedural guidance.52,655 
10.2.2. Medical therapy 
Diuretics, beta-blockers, digoxin, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers, and ivabradine can improve symptoms by controlling volume 
overload and heart rate. Anticoagulation with a VKA with a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is indicated in patients 
with AF, and DOACs should be avoided in patients with an MVA of 
≤2.0 cm2 according to current evidence.165,656,657 Interventions to restore sinus rhythm (cardioversion or catheter pulmonary vein isolation) 
are unlikely to be successful in patients with untreated severe MS. If AF 
is of recent onset and the LA moderately enlarged, cardioversion can be 
attempted soon after successful intervention or in patients with moderate MS combined with amiodarone treatment.658,659 In patients in 
sinus rhythm, OAC is indicated after systemic embolism or if a thrombus is present in the LA, and should also be considered when TOE 
shows dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast or an enlarged 
LA (M-mode diameter >50 mm or LA volume >60 mL/m2).660 
Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis is indicated as appropriate.5 
10.2.3. Indications for intervention 
The type (PMC or surgery) and timing of treatment should be decided 
based on clinical characteristics, the anatomy of the valve and subvalvular apparatus, and local expertise.661–663 The management of clinically 
severe rheumatic MS is summarized in Figure 14 and Recommendation 
Table 8. 
In general, indication for intervention should be limited to patients 
with clinically severe rheumatic MS (MVA <1.5 cm2) in whom PMC is 
expected to have a significant impact on clinical outcome. In higher- 
income countries, where the incidence of rheumatic fever and the number of PMCs performed is low, this treatment should be restricted to 
expert operators in specialized centres to improve safety and procedural success rate.661,664 Efforts should be made to increase the availability of PMC in lower-income countries, where access to treatment is 
limited for economic reasons.665,666 Percutaneous mitral commissurotomy 
may be also considered in symptomatic patients with an MVA of 
>1.5 cm2, if symptoms cannot be explained by another cause and 
if the anatomy is favourable (see Table 8). Percutaneous mitral 
commissurotomy should be considered as a first-line treatment for patients with anatomically suitable rheumatic MS and mild-to-moderate 
calcification without severe subvalvular impairment. Selected patients 
with unfavourable anatomical and clinical characteristics can still benefit 
from PMC, particularly if they are at increased surgical risk. When 
symptomatic restenosis occurs after surgical commissurotomy or 
PMC, reintervention in most cases requires surgical valve replacement, 
but redo PMC can be proposed in selected candidates with favourable 
characteristics, if the predominant mechanism is commissural refusion. 
Long-term follow-up has shown favourable results following PMC despite a growing number of elderly patients with suboptimal clinical and 
anatomical characteristics.663–665 
For patients in whom PMC is contraindicated (Table 8), surgical MV 
repair or, more frequently, replacement are good alternatives. 
Although repair is much more challenging than for PMR, it can be attempted at experienced centres.663 
For patients with multiple VHD including MS, a comprehensive 
evaluation by the Heart Team and an individualized approach is necessary. Surgery is preferable to PMC in patients with severe MS and severe AV disease, unless the surgical risk is high. In selected cases with 
severe MS and moderate AV disease, PMC can be performed to postpone surgical treatment of both valves. 
In high-risk cases with concomitant severe TR, PMC may be considered in selected patients with sinus rhythm, moderate atrial enlargement, and secondary TR due to post-capillary PH. In non-high-risk 
cases, surgery on both valves is preferred.651,652,662,667 Treatment of 
patients with low-gradient severe MS (MVA <1.5 cm2, mean gradient  
<10 mmHg) is challenging, because these patients are often older 
and have unfavourable anatomy.668,669 
10.2.4. Follow-up 
Asymptomatic patients with clinically severe MS who have not undergone intervention should be followed up yearly by TTE, and at longer intervals (2–3 years) in cases of moderate stenosis. After PMC, the 
post-procedural MVA and mean mitral gradient are important parameters that influence long-term clinical outcomes. Follow-up of patients 
after successful PMC is necessary because asymptomatic restenosis may 
occur. Progressive rheumatic involvement of other valves should be periodically assessed, irrespective of the therapy modality. Finally, education 
and the engagement of the family is key in patients with rheumatic MS, 
since it usually affects young individuals and women of childbearing age. 
10.3. Degenerative mitral stenosis with 
mitral annular calcification 
Patients presenting with MAC are elderly and have significant comorbidities, including disease of other valves. Mitral annular calcification is also an 
indicator of cardiovascular disease severity and is associated with an increased risk of AF, stroke, and death.670,671 The incidence of MAC varies 
substantially, depending on the age of the studied population and the imaging modality used. It can be a consequence of many different pathological processes and, depending on the underlying disease, can be 
accompanied by stenosis, regurgitation, or both. However, most patients 
with MAC do not have significant valvular dysfunction.647,672 
Generally, MS occurs due to calcific extension into the MV leaflets or 
subvalvular apparatus, and in some patients it is associated with combined MR.673 Treatment options (including transcatheter and surgical 
approaches) are high-risk procedures and evidence from RCTs is 
lacking.

10.3.1. Evaluation 
Echocardiography is used for initial evaluation, but is frequently limited 
by acoustic shadowing due to severe calcification. Evaluation of MVA by 
planimetry is less reliable than in rheumatic MS, and TOE should 
therefore be used liberally. Degenerative MS can coexist with varying 
degrees of MR. Mean transmitral gradient has been shown to be associated with increased mortality irrespective of MR severity.674 
Electrocardiogram-gated CCT is necessary to assess the degree and locations of calcifications, especially if an intervention is planned.647,674–676 
Calcifications are usually more prominent at the posterior aspect of the 
annulus. 
10.3.2. Indications for intervention 
Intervention is recommended in symptomatic patients who are not responsive to medical therapy, weighing the potential benefits of the procedure against its associated risks. In elderly patients with degenerative MS 
and MAC, surgery is technically challenging and high risk. However,

surgical MV repair or replacement with extensive decalcification and 
patch reconstruction of the annulus can be performed in selected patients 
at experienced centres (e.g. young patients post-chest radiation), where 
mortality rates of <5% have been reported.677–679 
Degenerative MS is not amenable to PMC because commissural fusion is absent. In symptomatic high-risk patients with suitable anatomy, transcatheter implantation of a TAVI prosthesis in the mitral 
position is feasible but associated with frequent complications, including LVOT obstruction, valve embolization, stroke, and haemolysis due 
to PVL. Open surgical valve replacement via the LA with a TAVI device 
is an alternative that allows complete anterior leaflet removal;680 
however, mortality remains high. The use of dedicated TMVI devices 
is therefore encouraged because it appears to be safer.542,681 Heart 
Team evaluation should guide the choice of treatment avoiding futility, 
because mortality remains high, even after successful treatment 
(10%–30% within 1 year). 
11. Tricuspid regurgitation 
11.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
TR is a common echocardiographic finding in the general population, 
with higher prevalence in women and older patients. Trivial or mild 
TR is mostly a benign condition. Significant TR (≥ moderate) has a reported age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of 0.55% (4% in people aged 
≥75 years).682 Severe TR is associated with increased risk of death 
and HF, independent of comorbidities, ventricular function, and pulmonary pressures.683–686 
Only 8%–10% of patients with TR present with clear anatomical abnormalities of the TV apparatus (primary TR), which can be due to infective endocarditis, RHD, carcinoid syndrome, congenital abnormalities (e.g. 
Ebstein’s anomaly), chest radiation, or myxomatous disease, as well as 
trauma or iatrogenic valve damage (e.g. after endomyocardial biopsy).682 
Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)-related TR represents a 
separate entity requiring a specific diagnostic approach and management.687 In patients with a CIED, diagnostic efforts should be made to 
clarify if the lead is the cause of TR (CIED-related TR) or incidental 
(CIED-associated TR).688 
In patients with secondary TR, TV leaflets are structurally normal and 
regurgitation is caused by annular dilatation and/or leaflet tethering due 
to RA dilatation, and/or RV dilation and dysfunction. Based on the main 
morphological and haemodynamic characteristics, two phenotypes of 
secondary TR have been proposed:689 (i) atrial secondary TR, mainly 
due to AF and characterized by the absence of significant leaflet tethering, but with marked RA and annular dilatation along with preserved RV 
size/function, pulmonary pressure, and LV function; and (ii) ventricular 
secondary TR, due to annular dilatation and leaflet tethering as a consequence of left-sided ventricular or valvular disease (post-capillary 
PH), pre-capillary PH, or primary RV cardiomyopathy/ischaemia (also 
after left-sided valve surgery).690 At an advanced disease stage, these 
two phenotypes may no longer be distinguishable, and therefore early 
characterization is key to determine outcome.691,692 Evidence of an impact on patient management is currently lacking; therefore, current 
recommendations for intervention consider mainly primary vs secondary TR.

11.2. Evaluation 
Echocardiography is recommended to assess patients with TR45 and 
should include evaluation of severity and aetiology (including characterization of left-sided heart disease and, if applicable, CIED lead location 
and interaction with the valve apparatus), the impact of TR on the right- 
sided chambers (RV and RA size and function), and assessment of central venous (inferior vena cava) and pulmonary pressures. Transthoracic 
echocardiography provides sufficient diagnostic information in most 
patients. Transoesophageal echocardiography is necessary for when 
visualization of the TV apparatus. In candidates for an intervention, advanced techniques, such as strain analysis and 3D echocardiography, 
should also be applied when available. 
Assessment of TR severity should be ideally performed in euvolaemic status, with optimized pulmonary and systemic pressures, and 
based on an integrative approach considering multiple qualitative and 
quantitative parameters (Figure 15).45,693 A grading scheme extending 
beyond severe, including ‘massive’ and ‘torrential’ grades, has been proposed to refine TR reduction assessment after transcatheter interventions and has been used in several studies.694,695 Although this 
five-grade scale may be associated with a proportional increase in 
symptoms and event risk,694,695 an intervention should be considered 
without delay, as soon as TR is severe, with the aim of reducing TR 
to moderate or less.696,697 
Echocardiographic assessment of the RV is challenging due to its 
complex geometry, imaging constraints, and the high dependency on 
loading conditions. When accurate measurements of RV size and function, as well as RV volume, are necessary for decision-making, CMR 
should be used because of its high accuracy and reproducibility.698,699 
In Figure 15, upper limits of normal for different RV size parameters 
are provided to guide definition of RV dilatation and remodelling. In 
the setting of severe TR, RV function is often overestimated and therefore the most conservative/cautious thresholds are suggested for the 
currently used echocardiographic parameters to identify RV dysfunction at the earliest stage possible. Cut-off values for severe RV dysfunction are also provided to indicate high-risk or possibly futile 
interventions. Although robust validation is lacking, all these reference 
values are chosen based on large multicentre reports of normative data 
and outcomes.60,697,700–704 
Echocardiography often underestimates pulmonary pressures in 
cases of severe TR.705 Right heart catheterization is therefore recommended in all candidates for an intervention to assess the haemodynamic consequences of TR on the RA and venous circulation (e.g. 
ventricularization of the RA pressure curves), measure end-diastolic 
RV pressure, and document volume overload. The assessment of pulmonary pressures and vascular resistance are key to exclude masked 
severe pre-capillary PH.706 
RV–pulmonary artery coupling refers to the ability of the RV systolic 
performance to match a given pulmonary afterload maintaining adequate cardiac output, and can be measured invasively or approximated using echocardiography [i.e. tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE)/SPAP].707,708 RV–pulmonary artery uncoupling 
(low TAPSE/SPAP) occurs when sustained increases in afterload cannot be matched by RV contractile reserve and has been associated 
with poor prognosis in different HF conditions, including severe TR. 
Although not yet prospectively validated, this index may improve 
risk stratification. 
Electrocardiogram-gated CCT with dedicated protocols ensuring 
sufficient contrast enhancement of the right heart cavities provides detailed characterization of the RA, RV, and vena cava anatomy, the location of the right coronary artery, and is crucial to assess suitability and 
device sizing for several transcatheter interventions.689,697 
Before any intervention is considered, careful evaluation of TR aetiology, disease stage (TR severity, RV and LV dysfunction, and PH), patient operative risk, and likelihood of recovery by a dedicated 
collaborative Heart Team is recommended (Figure 16). Dedicated clinical risk scores for TR patients have been described recently. The 
TRI-SCORE709 and the STS isolated TV risk calculator710 take into consideration clinical and echocardiographic signs of RV dysfunction, and 
secondary organ (particularly hepatic and renal) impairment. They 
both allow improved estimates of peri-procedural risk in patients 
with severe TR undergoing surgery and possibly help to avoid futile interventions.84,711 The importance of risk stratification was demonstrated in a recent registry analysis (n = 2413) comparing any 
interventions with conservative management. Early TV intervention 
(transcatheter valve repair or surgery) was associated with improved 
mid-term survival in patients with a low or intermediate TRI-SCORE 
(up to 5 points), while patients with a high TRI-SCORE (≥6) did not derive any benefit compared with conservative management.696 
Moreover, isolated TV surgery (repair or replacement) improved survival at 10 years in patients with a low TRI-SCORE (≤3). The same 
benefit was observed in patients with an intermediate TRI-SCORE 
(4–5) after successful TV repair only.689,697,709 Patients with moderate 
or severe TR should be regularly followed up clinically and by echocardiography at least every 6 months. 
11.3. Medical therapy 
Patients with relevant TR should be first treated according to the assumed aetiology, including optimal HF treatment, pulmonary vasodilators for PH, and rhythm control for AF.339,693 
In the case of HF symptoms, diuretics should be initiated in a stepwise approach,339 beginning with loop diuretics eventually combined 
with aldosterone antagonists, thiazide diuretics, and/or SGLT2is.712 
However, according to current knowledge, medical therapy has very 
limited effect on the evolution of TR severity and none of these measures should delay evaluation of an intervention at an expert centre.713 
11.4. Indications for intervention 
11.4.1. Surgery 
Patients are often referred too late for surgery when significant RV and 
other organ failure have occurred. Isolated TV surgery has therefore 
been considered to be generally high risk, with in-hospital mortality 
rates of 8%–10% in several reports,714,715 but contemporary cohorts 
have demonstrated improved outcomes when patients are referred 
earlier and more effective techniques are used.716 Valve repair using 
an annuloplasty ring is preferred over replacement, whenever technically feasible, especially in low-risk patients with suitable anatomy.709 
However, TV replacement may be necessary in cases of advanced disease with marked annular dilatation and leaflet tethering.688,717 For 
CIED-related TR, preparation of any entrapped tricuspid leaflet and 
possibly lead extraction with implantation of an epicardial system has 
been associated with improved TV function.688,717

11.4.1.1. Patients without indication for left-sided valve  
surgery 
In patients with severe TR but without the need for left-sided valve surgery, surgical intervention is recommended in operable symptomatic 
patients with primary TR (Figure 17; Recommendation Table 9).718 
Furthermore, it should be considered in symptomatic patients with secondary TR, or in asymptomatic patients with primary or secondary TR 
and signs of RV dilatation or RV function deterioration.719 However, 
patients with severe LV/RV dysfunction or PH do not qualify due to 
high operative risk.84,686,720 
11.4.1.2. Patients with indication for left-sided valve surgery 
Severe primary or secondary TR is unlikely to improve after isolated 
surgical treatment of left-sided valve disease, and reoperation for 
TR treatment is associated with high peri-operative mortality.721 
Therefore, TV surgery is recommended at the time of the index 
procedure. 
Mild TR with associated significant annular dilatation or moderate 
TR, if left uncorrected at the time of left-sided valve surgery, will progress in approximately one-quarter of patients and is associated with 
worse outcome.690,722 In patients with moderate TR, TV repair annuloplasty during MV surgery should be considered, because large retrospective studies723,724 and two recent RCTs have shown beneficial 
effects on TR progression and RV remodelling over time.725,726 
However, no effects on mortality, HF events, or reoperation were observed in the repair group.725,727 Concomitant TV repair has also 
been associated with a higher risk of conduction disturbances requiring pacemaker implantation (up to 14%),725,728 with potential negative 
impacts on longer-term outcomes.729,730 In patients with mild TR and 
annular dilatation (≥40 mm or >21 mm/m2) undergoing left-sided 
valve surgery, previous observational studies have demonstrated a 
benefit of concomitant TV repair in terms of TR progression723,724 
and RV function,731 and a trend towards improved long-term survival.724 
However, a subanalysis of a recent RCT did not identify any difference in 
the progression of TR or other outcomes in this category of patients

during a 2-year follow-up period.725 In turn, the need of pacemaker implantation after surgery led to a subsequent increase in HF hospitalizations, endocarditis, and mortality.729 Annuloplasty may therefore 
be considered after careful evaluation of the risk factors for progressive annular dilatation and TR (AF, RA size, pulmonary pressures, 
etc.), balancing against the risk of possible pacemaker implantation 
(Supplementary data online, Table S5).732 
11.4.2. Transcatheter techniques 
Several transcatheter approaches for the treatment of TR have been 
developed, including TEER, direct annuloplasty, and orthotopic and heterotopic TV replacement. Data from large multicentre registries, single- 
arm clinical trials, and two recent RCTs in patients with severe TR at 
intermediate and high risk for surgery have shown the safety of transcatheter repair, as well as the ability to reduce TR to moderate or less in

more than 80% of cases when anatomical suitability was confirmed.713,733–735 The Clinical Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular 
Outcomes in Patients Treated With the Tricuspid Valve Repair 
System (TRILUMINATE) Pivotal Trial showed also a lower incidence 
of the composite endpoint of death from any cause or TV surgery, 
HF hospitalization, and improvement in quality of life as measured 
with the KCCQ score after tricuspid TEER compared with medical 
treatment that was exclusively driven by improved quality of life 
[11.7 points (95% CI, 6.8–16.6); P <0.001].713 At 2 years, a lower incidence of HF hospitalizations has been observed in the intervention 
group, despite a high rate of crossovers (59%).736 
Another investigator-initiated RCT (the Tri.Fr trial) demonstrated 
the benefit of tricuspid TEER in combination with GDMT over medical 
therapy alone, for a composite score driven by improved PROMs.737 
Another recent RCT (the Edwards EVOQUE Transcatheter 
Tricuspid Valve Replacement: Pivotal Clinical Investigation of Safety 
and Clinical Efficacy using a Novel Device (TRISCEND) II trial), comparing transcatheter TV replacement with optimized medical therapy in 
patients with symptomatic severe TR, showed similar results with a 
win ratio favouring TV replacement mainly explained by symptom 
and quality-of-life improvement. In these studies, reverse RV remodelling was also observed. However, the safety profile of transcatheter TV 
replacement was less favourable, including higher risk for major bleeding (15%) and post-procedural pacemaker implantation in about one- 
quarter of the pacemaker-naïve patients after 12 months of follow- 
up.738 Based on these data, transcatheter treatment should be considered to improve quality of life and RV remodelling in high-risk patients 
with symptomatic severe TR, despite optimal medical therapy, but 
without severe RV dysfunction or pre-capillary PH. 
Transvenous CIED lead repositioning or extraction can be considered in selected patients to improve TR or avoid lead jailing before 
any tricuspid interventions, although the efficacy of this procedure is 
uncertain and the risk of damaging the TV not negligible.688,717,739 
Recurrent TR after previous tricuspid annuloplasty usually requires cardiac reoperation for surgical TV replacement. Transcatheter valve-in-ring 
implantation is an off-label procedure to treat residual TR in high-risk patients. Challenges are the non-circular shape and the open form of the surgical annuloplasty ring.740 However, transcatheter tricuspid valve-in-valve 
procedures have been performed with satisfactory results.741 
Transcatheter TV procedures should be performed at an experienced Heart Valve Centre with expertise in the treatment of 
TV disease (Table 6). Careful evaluation of clinical and anatomical 
suitability is key for appropriate patient and device selection to 
achieve optimal TR reduction and symptomatic response to the 
therapy. 
12. Tricuspid stenosis 
12.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Tricuspid stenosis (TS) is a relatively rare disease that is most commonly 
associated with congenital conditions or enzymatic disorders, such as 
Whipple’s or Fabry’s disease. It can also be acquired as an isolated manifestation of RHD or occur in combination with aortic and/or MV involvement. Moreover, TS can be the consequence of carcinoid disease due to 
serotonin-mediated proliferation, causing apposition of fibroblasts and 
extracellular matrix on the valve leaflets and the subvalvular apparatus. 
Rare causes include medications (e.g. fenfluramine or methysergide) or inflow obstruction due to CIED-associated thrombus formation or endocarditis with large vegetations. 
12.2. Evaluation 
Valve evaluation and diagnosis of TS is based on echocardiography, and 
consists of the anatomical assessment of the leaflet tissue and the subvalvular apparatus. Leaflet thickening with or without calcifications and

commissural fusions are pathognomonic findings of rheumatic involvement. A mean diastolic transvalvular gradient of >5 mmHg at a normal 
heart rate indicates severe TS.649 
12.3. Medical therapy 
Medical therapy is a bridge to surgical or transcatheter intervention. 
Intensive sodium restriction and concomitant diuretic therapy can 
lead to symptom improvement and diminish hepatic congestion. 
12.4. Indications for intervention 
Although valve repair is preferred in younger patients,752 valve replacement is frequently required (see Recommendation Table 10). Biological 
heart valves have demonstrated adequate mid- and long-term results, 
and are preferred over MHVs because of high thrombogenicity in the 
low-pressure system.753 In the case of BHV degeneration, transcatheter 
valve-in-valve procedures are good alternatives to re-replacement.754 
Transcatheter TV implantation is an emerging field, although limited experience is available for the treatment of TS.749,755 In patients with carcinoid disease, a stable oncological situation is a prerequisite for any 
valve intervention to maximize survival and valve durability.756 
Although data are very limited, TV balloon valvuloplasty can be an 
option in selected patients with TS (and no relevant TR), as well as in 
those with concomitant mitral and tricuspid rheumatic pathology.757 
However, in contrast to rheumatic MS, tricuspid rheumatic disease 
more frequently presents as combined stenosis and regurgitation, 
which limits the applicability of balloon valvuloplasty. 
13. Multiple and mixed valvular 
heart disease 
13.1. Prevalence and undertreatment 
Patients frequently present with disease of more than one native heart 
valve [multiple VHD (MVHD)], or coexisting stenosis and regurgitation 
of the same valve (mixed VHD).758 While the main cause of MVHD or 
mixed VHD has shifted to degeneration in high-income countries, the 
leading aetiology in low- and middle-income countries remains 
RHD.758,759 Regurgitation of atrioventricular valves secondary to cardiomyopathy or long-standing primary valve disease, and late effects of radiation therapy, are further causes of MVHD.758,760 Challenges in diagnostic 
evaluation coupled with limited data to guide clinical decisions contribute 
to late referral and undertreatment of patients with MVHD.758 
13.2. Evaluation and diagnostic pitfalls 
In view of the complex haemodynamic interplay of multiple and mixed 
valve lesions, assessment by a Heart Team at a Heart Valve Centre and 
use of an integrative multimodality approach is key to gain diagnostic 
certainty, detect cardiac damage, and evaluate therapeutic options.761,762 In the light of paucity of data on diagnostic and prognostic 
parameters in patients with MVHD, assessment largely focuses on 
pathophysiological considerations and evidence derived from isolated 
valve lesions. 
Echocardiography is the main tool to diagnose MVHD, assess mechanism, severity, and associated cardiac damage, and monitor disease 
progression.761 Haemodynamic interdependence between multiple 
valve defects alters the loading and flow conditions, thereby limiting 
the diagnostic validity of measures established to grade single valve defects (Table 9). In the presence of MVHD, low-flow states are frequent. 
The continuity equation becomes erroneous if transvalvular flows are 
unequal, and pressure half-time (PHT)-derived methods are inaccurate 
if the ventricular compliance or filling is altered.761 In this context, 
TOE can provide important detailed anatomical and mechanistic 
flow-independent information.46,761 
If symptoms or echocardiographic findings are equivocal, multimodality diagnostics should be considered on an individual basis to assess 
the cumulative repercussions of MVHD. 
Measures obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing reflect 
the effect of MVHD on functional capacity.52,105,654,761,779 Levels of 
natriuretic peptides such as NT-proBNP correlate with functional 
and echocardiographic parameters, and provide incremental prognostic value in patients with mixed aortic disease and MVHD.98,780 AV calcium scoring confirms the diagnosis of true severe AS under low-flow 
conditions, as described in Section 8.2.777 Cardiac magnetic resonance 
imaging enables the independent assessment of valvular regurgitation 
using volumetric methods or direct flow quantification.45,46,522,762,781 
Importantly, invasive cardiac output-derived measures based on 
thermodilution or the Fick equation using estimated oxygen uptake 
are inaccurate in low-flow conditions or severe TR, commonly present in MVHD.782 
13.3. Indications for intervention 
Given the heterogeneity of clinical scenarios and the lack of evidence on 
optimal treatment pathways, it is recommended that patients with 
MVHD are evaluated for intervention by a collaborative Heart Team 
at a Heart Valve Centre with experience in multimodality imaging 
and treatment of complex VHD.16,764 
Patients presenting with a lesion fulfilling criteria for an intervention 
based on recommendations for single VHD should be treated accordingly. In the remaining patients, assessment of symptoms and functional 
status, as well as cardiac damage (which may be masked by the consequences of concomitant lesions and occur before symptoms manifest), 
is required. The risk–benefit ratio of intervention needs to take into 
account diagnostic (un)certainty, the mechanisms and severity of 
MVHD, and patient-specific factors, as well as procedural options and 
risks to determine the mode, timing, and sequence of valve treatment. 
13.3.1. Multiple valvular heart disease 
Multiple VHD with primary (as opposed to secondary) valvular disease 
usually requires surgical treatment of all relevant valvular lesions. 
Simultaneous treatment of concomitant severe valve defects is recommended and treatment of concomitant moderate AS, or moderate TR, 
should be considered (Recommendation Table 11).

Transcatheter treatment options are established for severe AS 
(TAVI), rheumatic MS (PMC), and primary MR and TR (TEER or transcatheter replacement) in patients with MVHD at high surgical risk, if 
anatomy is suitable.401,783 In the context of a transcatheter strategy, 
a staged approach—typically beginning with the downstream lesion 
(aortic, followed by mitral and tricuspid)—is generally preferred to 
avoid potential haemodynamic deterioration.784,785 
MVHD with severe secondary regurgitation of both atrioventricular 
valves is usually the consequence of either HFrEF with ventricular SMR 
and secondary TR, or atrial dilatation leading to both atrial MR and TR

(often TR > MR). While surgery aims to address all relevant valve lesions 
in a single procedure, a stepwise transcatheter strategy offers the possibility of reassessing the upstream valve(s) under altered loading conditions, usually 3 months after the initial intervention. In very selected 
cases simultaneous transcatheter valve treatment may be considered.788,789 However, evidence is limited and primarily derived from 
modestly sized observational studies.786–789 
13.3.2. Mixed aortic valve disease 
The severity of mixed AV disease is often underestimated and patients 
with balanced moderate AR and AS show adverse event rates comparable to patients with severe isolated AS.790,791 
Transvalvular gradients measured by Doppler reflect the overall 
haemodynamic burden of both regurgitation and stenosis, and are strongly associated with adverse outcomes.765,791–793 Therefore, the presence 
of high transvalvular gradients justifies valve intervention in patients 
with moderate mixed AV disease, even if regurgitation is graded as moderate and the calculated or planimetric AVA is >1 cm2 (Recommendation 
Table 12). Patients presenting with mixed AV disease, but with gradients 
below thresholds for intervention, should undergo careful multimodality 
diagnostics including assessment of cardiac damage to inform individual 
treatment strategies. Global longitudinal strain and natriuretic peptides 
have shown incremental prognostic value beyond symptom status and 
single lesion severity in patients with preserved LVEF.762,794–796 
13.3.3. Mixed mitral valve disease 
Mixed MV disease is usually present in patients with rheumatic valve disease or MAC. If MVA is ≤1.5 cm2, recommendations for isolated MS 
apply. However, patients with an MVA of >1.5 cm2 and moderate 
MR may be evaluated for valve replacement based on symptoms, anatomical characteristics, transmitral gradient, and signs of cardiac damage 
such as LA dilatation, AF, or PH.529,674,776,797 
13.4. Follow-up 
Due to the cumulative haemodynamic impact of MVHD or mixed 
VHD, progression of its severity and the development of cardiac damage may be faster than in single VHD.761 Therefore, follow-up intervals 
should be adjusted according to individual patient characteristics. 
14. Management of patients with 
prosthetic valves or valve repair 
14.1. Choice of prosthetic valve 
When choosing between an MHV and a BHV prosthesis for an individual 
patient, age, life expectancy, lifestyle, bleeding and thromboembolic risks, 
possibility of pregnancy, and patient preference should be considered. 
Life expectancy is estimated according to age, sex, comorbidities, ethnicity, 
and geographical area.798 An MHV is preferred in younger patients with 
longer life expectancy and in those with a pre-existing indication for long- 
term OAC (Recommendation Table 13). Generally, a BHV is implanted in 
patients with shorter life expectancy, increased bleeding risk due to frailty 
or comorbidities, in women contemplating pregnancy, and in patients in 
whom stable INRs with adequate times in therapeutic range are unlikely.799 
Importantly, the performance of different BHV prostheses can vary considerably.800 The impact of the aetiology of the native valve disease, if any, on 
the choice between an MHV and a BHV remains unexplored. 
Several large observational studies, smaller RCTs, and meta-analyses 
have compared long-term mortality with BHV and MHV prostheses in 
patients aged 50–70 years.376,801–805 Some of the studies showed 
lower mortality with an MHV in AV patients <60 years and MV patients 
<65 years old,801,804 while others failed to show any differences.376,802,803 Most of these studies were limited by their observational nature and missing information on the type of prostheses 
implanted. RCTs with sufficient statistical power comparing biological 
and mechanical prostheses are warranted. 
Replacement of the AV using an autograft (Ross procedure) is an 
alternative to an MHV in young patients that should be performed 
at experienced centres by operators with dedicated expertise (see 
also Section 8).806 General recommendations are summarized in

14.2. Follow-up of patients with prosthetic 
valves 
All patients with prosthetic valves require lifelong clinical and echocardiographic follow-up to detect deterioration of prosthetic function, 
associated cardiac damage, or progressive disease of another valve. 
Serial TTE measurements of transprosthetic gradients, calculation of 
the effective valve area, and evaluation of leaflet motion and morphology should be performed in patients receiving a BHV within 
3 months after valve implantation, again at 1 year, and annually thereafter, or sooner if new cardiovascular symptoms occur.812 TOE is recommended in all cases of suspected prosthetic valve dysfunction or 
endocarditis. In the latter case, CCT and PET-CT are also recommended, if the diagnosis is unclear, and to identify primary or secondary infection foci.5 
Cinefluoroscopy for MHVs and CCT provide useful additional information, if valve thrombus or pannus is suspected.812 Imaging should be 
repeated in the case of thrombolytic and antithrombotic treatment of 
MVH thrombosis, even if gradients are normalized.813 
14.3. Antithrombotic therapy in patients 
with treated valvular heart disease 
14.3.1. Mechanical heart valves 
14.3.1.1. Post-operative anticoagulation and therapeutic targets 
Mechanical heart valves require lifelong treatment with a VKA 
guided by the INR. Bridging with either therapeutic unfractionated 
heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and 
VKA should be initiated within 24 h after MHV implantation, or as 
soon as considered safe. Heparin can be stopped when the INR is 
documented for 2 consecutive days within the therapeutic range 
(Figure 18).814 Two meta-analyses and a prospective study have suggested slightly lower bleeding rates using UFH bridging compared 
with LMWH after MHV replacement or cardiac surgery.814–816 
However, RCTs comparing the timing and dosage of each bridging 
strategy are lacking. 
For all patients with an MHV, lifelong VKA is recommended to 
avoid major thrombotic complications, since cardioembolic or valve 
thrombosis rates without anticoagulation are substantial (12% per 
year and 22% per year for first-generation aortic and mitral MHVs, 
respectively).817 The INR target and range should be chosen considering the type, position, and number of valves, the patient’s thrombotic risk, and comorbidities (see Table 10 and Recommendation 
Table 14). In patients with an MHV developing a major thromboembolic complication despite adequate INR and time in therapeutic 
range (TTR, usually defined as >60%),820 either increased VKA intensity (e.g. INR target and range increased by 0.5 units) or the addition 
of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (75–100 mg/day) should be considered.818 Direct oral anticoagulants or dual antiplatelet therapy 
(DAPT) are contraindicated to prevent thromboembolism in patients 
with an MHV.821–824 
Given the complexity of lifelong VKA therapy due to high intra- 
and interpatient variability, the need for monitoring, drug and food 
interactions,825,826 the narrow therapeutic window, influence of comorbidities, and non-modifiable characteristics (e.g. ageing, genetics, 
and ethnicity), RCTs have shown that patient’s education, as well 
as disease and treatment awareness, significantly improves anticoagulation quality and adherence.827–830 International normalized ratio self-monitoring and/or self-management increase efficacy, but 
not safety, as compared with a standard approach; INR self- 
monitoring can be used by motivated patients after adequate 
training.827–830 
The indication for VKA and DAPT combination in MHV patients 
presenting with acute coronary syndrome is described in the corresponding ESC Guidelines.151,831 In patients with an MHV and an indication for single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) due to symptomatic 
major atherosclerotic diseases and low bleeding risk, low-dose 
ASA in combination with a VKA should be considered, because 
this strategy has been shown to significantly lower the incidence 
of major adverse cardiovascular events.818 However, the combination of antiplatelet agents (single or dual) and VKA increases the 
risk of bleeding,825 and therefore their use should be carefully 
weighted. In a large meta-analysis that included MHV patients, the 
combination of VKA with either ASA or clopidogrel increased clinically relevant bleeding compared with VKA alone (clopidogrel odds 
ratio, 3.55; 95% CI, 2.78–4.54; ASA odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.29– 
1.74), which may be aggravated because of potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions on the cytochrome P (CYP)450s 2C19 and

14.3.1.2. Prevention and management of bleeding 
Since patients with MHVs receive lifelong VKA, strategies to prevent 
bleeding need to be implemented. Proton pump inhibitors reduce 
the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding by approximately 40% in patients taking VKAs825,839,840 and should therefore be prescribed to patients with MHVs, particularly in those with additional bleeding risk 
factors (e.g. elderly, antiplatelet agent co-administration, chronic use 
of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, high INR, or alcohol abuse). 
Randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis did not demonstrate 
a benefit of oral vitamin K1 supplementation in addition to temporary 
VKA cessation in non-bleeding patients with a supratherapeutic INR 
(4.5–10.0), with a trend toward reduced safety, which may be relevant 
for MHV patients.841,842 For non-bleeding patients with an INR of 
>10.0, oral vitamin K1 (2.0–3.0 mg) should be administered, avoiding 
overcorrection.841,843 
In cases of uncontrolled life-threatening or other major bleeding,844 
VKA use must be interrupted and reversal with non-activated 
four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates is preferred over fresh 
frozen plasma, because of higher safety and effectiveness.845–848 A reduced 
starting dose (12.5 rather than 25 IU/kg) in patients with more thrombogenic MHVs may be considered.849 In addition, vitamin K1 should be administered to reverse the effect of VKA. Intravenous route corrects 
INR ∼4 h faster than oral administration,850 with no differences at 24 h 
and an unknown clinical impact. VKA should be restarted as soon as major 
bleeding is controlled. 
14.3.1.3. Management of anticoagulation therapy before and after 
non-cardiac invasive procedures 
In patients with an MHV, VKA treatment should not be interrupted for: 
minor or minimally invasive procedures on the skin or eyes (including 
cataract with topical anaesthesia); dental cleaning, treatment of caries, 
and dental extractions; pacemaker implantation; cardiac catheterization; 
and endoscopic procedures (Recommendation Table 15; Table 11).851–856 
Topical antifibrinolytic or haemostatic agents may improve local 
haemostasis.853 
In patients with an MHV and high thromboembolic risk 
(Recommendation Table 16; Table 11) undergoing non-cardiac, elective 
major invasive procedures with high risk of bleeding (see  
Supplementary data online, Table S6), VKA treatment must be interrupted at least 4 days before the procedure, bridging with LMWH 
should be started as soon as the INR reaches a subtherapeutic value, 
and the INR should be <1.5 on the day of surgery.816,857,858 
Measuring anti-Xa activity at peak and trough may be appropriate to 
manage LMWH dosing in selected patients, such as those with severe 
obesity or underweight.859 In cases of urgent, major invasive procedures, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate should be administrated to timely correct the INR for the intervention, if needed. For 
the management of antithrombotic drugs in patients undergoing major 
cardiac surgery, please refer to recent EACTS Guidelines.860

For patients with an MHV and low cardioembolic risk (e.g. a new- 
generation MHV in the aortic position without additional risk factors) 
undergoing elective major NCS or invasive procedures, VKA interruption (3–4 days before surgery)816,857,858,861–864 and resumption861–863 
within 24 h may be performed without bridging to reduce post-surgical 
bleeding without increasing the risk of thrombosis (see Figure 18). 
14.3.2. Biological heart valves 
The management of antithrombotic treatment after BHV implantation 
or valve repair is summarized in Recommendation Table 16 and Figure 19. 
14.3.2.1. Patients with a surgical biological heart valve and no 
indication for oral anticoagulation 
The optimal antithrombotic strategy early after surgical implantation of 
an aortic BHV remains controversial due to the lack of high-quality evidence. Multiple observational studies support the short-term use of 
VKAs to reduce the risk of thromboembolism,865,866 while data on 
DOACs are missing. A small RCT and a meta-analysis found that 
VKA treatment for 3 months significantly increased major bleeding 
compared with low-dose ASA, without reducing mortality or 
thromboembolic events, but statistical power was low.867,868 
Therefore, both strategies (OAC or ASA) are reasonable within 
3 months of surgical aortic BHV implantation. In the absence of randomized evidence, patients undergoing mitral or tricuspid BHV implantation should receive OAC for at least 3 months due to the increased 
risk of AF and thromboembolisms. 
14.3.2.2. Patients with a transcatheter heart valve and no indication 
for oral anticoagulation 
Based on evidence from RCTs, lifelong low-dose ASA is the recommended antithrombotic treatment after TAVI in patients without 
OAC indication. In the Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing 
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (POPular TAVI) trial (cohort 
A), the incidence of bleeding and the composite of bleeding or 
thromboembolic events were both reduced with ASA compared 
with DAPT at 1 year.869 One RCT [Global multicenter, open-label, randomized,

antithrombotic strategy of rivaroxaban (10 mg/day) in combination 
with low-dose ASA compared with DAPT with clopidogrel for the first 
3 months, was halted prematurely due to an increased risk of death or 
thromboembolic complications, and an increased risk of bleeding in 
the rivaroxaban/ASA group.870 The systematic use of DOACs after 
TAVI in patients without indication for OAC is therefore not recommended. Data on antithrombotic management after implantation of 
transcatheter mitral BHVs or tricuspid BHVs are limited. Vitamin K antagonist treatment for ≥3 months is commonly prescribed, while 
DOACs may represent an alternative allowing for earlier discharge 
and a lower risk of short-term bleeding complications (median follow- 
up, 4.7 months).871 
For patients without baseline OAC undergoing mitral or tricuspid 
transcatheter valve implantation, OAC (either with DOAC or VKA) 
is initiated and usually pursued for at least 6 months or indefinitely 
(in particular after valve implantation in the tricuspid position), while 
patients undergoing TEER usually receive single long-term antiplatelet 
therapy with ASA. 
14.3.2.3. Patients with a surgical biological heart valve and an 
indication for oral anticoagulation 
Lifelong OAC is recommended for patients with surgical BHVs with 
other indications for OAC. The evidence supports the use of 
DOACs in preference to VKAs in patients with AF, even during the 
early post-operative period.872–877 A previously existing therapy with 
a DOAC may be continued after BHV implantation and should be restarted, as soon as considered surgically safe, usually within 2–3 days of 
surgery.860 
14.3.2.4. Patients with a transcatheter biological heart valve and an 
indication for oral anticoagulation 
In the POPular TAVI trial (cohort B), the incidence of bleeding over a period of 1 month or 1 year was lower with OAC than with OAC plus clopidogrel.878 Oral anticoagulation alone was non-inferior to OAC plus 
clopidogrel with respect to ischaemic events, but the non-inferiority margin was large. In Edoxaban vs Standard of Care and Their Effects on 
Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic 
Valve Implantation–Atrial Fibrillation (ENVISAGE-TAVI-AF),879 edoxaban 
was non-inferior to VKA regarding the composite primary endpoint 
(death from any cause, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, systemic 
thromboembolic event, valve thrombosis, or major bleeding), but the incidence of major bleeding was higher with edoxaban than with VKA. The 
Anti-Thrombotic Strategy to Lower All Cardiovascular and Neurologic 
Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Events after Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation 
for Aortic Stenosis (ATLANTIS) trial880 showed that apixaban was not 
superior to VKA after TAVI when there was a pre-existing indication 
for OAC, and there was a signal of higher non-cardiovascular mortality 
with apixaban. Therefore, no definitive recommendation can be made 
concerning the use of VKAs vs DOACs in patients who have undergone 
TAVI with a pre-existing indication for OAC. 
Antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter MV or TV implantation 
remains empirical because data are limited. A high proportion of patients are already under OAC because of AF (almost 50% of the population with MR and 80%–90% of the candidates for TR treatment). 
Common practice is to continue the pre-existing anticoagulation regimen. Vitamin K antagonists and DOACs have been used in this setting 
with or without combination with ASA.871 However, the high bleeding 
risk of this usually elderly population needs to be taken into 
consideration.

14.4. Management of prosthetic valve 
dysfunction and complications 
Prosthetic valve dysfunction can occur due to intrinsic permanent 
changes to the prosthetic valve (defined as SVD) or non-structural valve 
dysfunction resulting from any abnormality not intrinsic to the prosthetic valve itself. Valve thrombosis and endocarditis are considered 
separate entities due to their specific presentation and management, 
but may both result in SVD. 
14.4.1. Structural valve deterioration 
Structural valve deterioration has been defined by several consensus 
documents812,895,896 and includes wear and tear, leaflet disruption, 
leaflet fibrosis or calcification, and stent or strut fracture or deformation. BHV (transcatheter or surgical) SVD is more frequent than 
MHV SVD. The incidence of SVD may be underestimated by the simple 
analysis of patients with valve-related deaths or those undergoing reintervention. To ensure timely diagnosis, serial measurement should be 
performed and compared with the TTE performed at discharge, or 
within 1–3 months after valve implantation. 
The criteria for haemodynamic deterioration associated with 
aortic and mitral SVD can be found in Table 12.895,896 The diagnosis of moderate or severe haemodynamic deterioration should 
prompt referral to an experienced Heart Valve Centre for evaluation and treatment, and to exclude all causes of non-structural 
valve dysfunction, particularly PVL or PPM, as well as thrombosis 
and endocarditis. This step requires the use of advanced 
imaging techniques (TOE, CCT, and/or PET-CT) to document 
SVD-related morphological changes and elucidate its mechanism. 
Structural valve deterioration associated with corresponding clinical criteria (e.g. new onset or worsening of symptoms, LV or RV 
dilation/dysfunction, or PH) indicates BHV failure with potential 
need for reintervention. Decisions about the treatment modality 
(redo surgery or transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation) should 
be made within the interdisciplinary Heart Team, depending on reoperation risk and anatomical considerations,445,897 including the 
risk of coronary obstruction,144,442,446,461 as well as prosthesis 
type and size.898–900 When considering a valve-in-valve procedure 
for a degenerated aortic BHV, the possibility of creating a PPM in 
small valves should be anticipated and may impact intervention or 
valve selection.448 
Given the larger sizes of BHVs in mitral or tricuspid positions, transfemoral/transseptal valve-in-valve implantation represents an attractive 
alternative to redo open surgery.570,900–903 In the case of mitral 
valve-in-valve implantation the risk of LVOT obstruction, although

infrequent, should be carefully ruled out, especially in patients with 
small and hypertrophic ventricles.904 
14.4.2. Non-structural valve dysfunction 
14.4.2.1. Prosthesis–patient mismatch 
Prosthesis–patient mismatch should be prevented whenever possible after either transcatheter or surgical valve-replacement procedures (see Section 8.5.1.2). When occurring in the aortic 
position, severe PPM is associated with decreased quality of life, increased rate of rehospitalization and reintervention, and possible 
reduction in long-term survival, although findings are not consistent 
throughout all studies.454,905–909 Moderate PPM is more common, 
but seems to have a limited impact on outcomes. The projected 
indexed EOA may be predicted prior to valve implantation to 
avoid severe PPM,908 although this concept has been challenged.910 
Less is known about the prevalence and consequences of PPM in 
the mitral and tricuspid positions, and established definitions are 
lacking. 
Prosthesis–patient mismatch is an infrequent indication for reintervention. However, reoperation should be considered in symptomatic patients with severe PPM, particularly if the patient is low 
risk.394,437,438 
14.4.2.2. Paravalvular leak and haemolysis 
The diagnosis of PVL requires systematic TOE, because TTE may be 
inconclusive. Haemolytic anaemia can often be detected in patients 
with prosthetic valves and is best assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase and haptoglobin serum levels, but rarely leads to symptoms. Intervention is needed if a PVL causes haemolysis requiring 
blood transfusions or symptoms, or if secondary to valve endocarditis. 
Transcatheter PVL closure is a valid alternative to surgery in the case 
of significant regurgitation or haemolysis, if feasible depending on the 
size and location of the leak, but requires specific expertise and planning. Care must be taken not to interfere with mechanical leaflet motion in MHV patients. Reported results for transcatheter PVL closure 
are inconsistent, with several patients returning with recurrent PVL 
and/or haemolysis.911 When surgery or transcatheter intervention 
are contraindicated, medical therapy aims to counteract the effect 
of haemolysis (iron supplementation and erythropoietin) or reduce 
it (beta-blockers).912 
14.4.3. Endocarditis 
Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in all patients with a prosthetic valve (including transcatheter valve prostheses) and after valve 
repair using prosthetic material or with previous episode(s) of infective endocarditis, and should also be considered after transcatheter 
MV or TV repair.5 It is recommended in such patients when undergoing dental extractions, oral surgery, or other procedures requiring 
manipulation of the gingival or peri-apical region of the teeth. 
Particular attention to dental and cutaneous hygiene, and strict 
aseptic measures during any invasive procedure, are also advised in 
this population. Additional details on endocarditis prophylaxis are 
mentioned in the 2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of 
endocarditis.5 
14.4.4. Valve thrombosis 
Valve thrombosis occurs mainly in MHVs,913,914 but can also be observed in BHVs.915,916 The spectrum of BHV thrombosis ranges 
from incidental CCT findings, such as hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) with or without reduced leaflet motion but normal 
gradients, to clinically apparent presentations with elevated 
gradients, symptoms of valve obstruction, or thromboembolic 
events.917–919 
14.4.4.1. Hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening 
Hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening is detected by CCT in 10%–30% of 
aortic BHVs depending on antithrombotic management, the definition 
of HALT, the timepoint of assessment, and the type of valve.917,919–921 
The significance and clinical implications of these findings with respect 
to thromboembolic risk and valve durability remain uncertain. 
Accordingly, routine use of CCT to detect HALT is not indicated.918–920 In patients with relevant increases in gradients, in 
whom HALT and restricted leaflet motion is confirmed by CCT, 
elective use of DOACs or VKAs should be considered to resolve leaflet thrombosis.918,921,922 
14.4.4.2. Clinically significant valve thrombosis 
Obstructive valve thrombosis should be suspected in any patient 
with any type of prosthetic valve who presents with new-onset 
dyspnoea or HF symptoms, an embolic event, or an unexpected increase in transvalvular gradients. If TTE findings are uncertain, the 
diagnosis should be confirmed by TOE and/or CCT to distinguish 
between 
thrombus, 
pannus, 
and 
degeneration.923–925 
Cinefluoroscopy can detect impaired MHV leaflet motion and reduced opening angles. 
Adequate anticoagulation must be promptly restored in all patients 
with MHV thrombosis and subtherapeutic INR. Although surgery remains the first-line option in critically ill patients, emergency valve replacement is associated with increased risk, whereas bleeding and 
systemic embolism are increased with fibrinolysis.926–928 Slow, low- 
dose infusion appears to lower complication rates, while preserving 
thrombolytic success rates.928–931a It is recommended that the decision between surgery and fibrinolysis is taken within the Heart 
Team, and individualized by weighing clinical factors and local expertise (Figure 20). 
Management of non-obstructive thrombosis or obstructive 
thrombosis of an MHV without pronounced HF symptoms depends mainly on the occurrence of a thromboembolic event 
and the size of the thrombus. Surgery should be considered for 
a large (>10 mm) non-obstructive prosthetic valve thrombus 
that is complicated by embolism or persists despite optimal 
OAC.913,932,933 
Anticoagulation using a VKA is the first-line treatment for clinically 
relevant BHV thrombosis, unless urgent reintervention or fibrinolysis is required due to progressive acute HF or haemodynamic 
instability.934–938 Because clinically relevant BHV thrombosis is associated with recurrence and may contribute to prosthetic degeneration, indefinite anticoagulation may be considered after a 
confirmed episode, but this strategy must be balanced against the 
risk of bleeding.936,939

### 15 Management during

non-cardiac surgery 
In patients with significant VHD who undergo NCS, the risk of peri- 
operative cardiovascular complications is increased and related to 
both the timing of the procedure (i.e. urgent vs non-urgent) and type 
of surgery (low, intermediate, or high risk), as well as patient-specific 
factors (type and severity of VHD, LV function, etc.).194,957–959 
Detailed recommendations related to NCS are available in the 2022 
ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular assessment and management of patients 
undergoing non-cardiac surgery.960 
15.1. Pre-operative evaluation 
Echocardiography should be performed in all patients with VHD requiring 
NCS. Patient- and surgery-specific factors, along with risk calculators, can 
be used to guide the treatment strategy. Determination of functional capacity is a pivotal step for pre-operative risk assessment, measured either by 
the ability to perform activities in daily life or by exercise testing. Screening 
for frailty using validated tools is advisable.90 Decisions on pre- and peri- 
operative management, surveillance, and continuation of chronic cardiovascular medical treatment should be taken after multidisciplinary discussion involving cardiologists, surgeons, and cardiac anaesthesiologists, as 
well as the team who will be in charge of the NCS. Patients receiving 
OAC treatment should be managed as described in Section 14. 
15.2. Specific valve lesions 
15.2.1. Aortic stenosis 
In patients with severe symptomatic AS, the treatment depends on the 
urgency and risk of NCS. If life-saving time-sensitive NCS is needed, it 
should be performed under careful haemodynamic monitoring avoiding 
rapid changes of volume status, with prompt treatment of arrhythmia regardless of AS severity. In cases of urgent high-risk NCS, TAVI or balloon 
aortic valvuloplasty should be considered in patients with critical AS prior 
to surgery, considering the risk of developing severe acute AR after

balloon aortic valvuloplasty.194,961 Urgent low- and intermediate-risk 
NCS can be performed relatively safely in patients with severe AS.962 
Patients in whom NCS can be deferred (i.e. non-urgent NCS) 
should undergo pre-operative Heart Team evaluation to determine 
whether SAVR or TAVI is preferable. TAVI may be preferred to 
SAVR if faster recovery plays a role, particularly in elderly patients 
in whom complex or high-risk NCS is planned.963 The treatment of 
asymptomatic patients with severe AS should be individualized 
(Figure 21).964 
15.2.2. Mitral stenosis 
Heart rate and fluid balance should be controlled to prevent pulmonary 
oedema during NCS and arterial vasodilators should be avoided. 
Non-cardiac surgery is safe in patients with an MVA of >1.5 cm2, and in 
asymptomatic patients with MVA ≤1.5 cm2 and SPAP of <50 mmHg. 
Symptomatic patients or those with SPAP of >50 mmHg should undergo 
PMC or other appropriate valve intervention before high-risk NCS, if possible.965,966 Asymptomatic patients with MVA ≤1.5 cm2 can undergo 
low-to-moderate-risk NCS under careful monitoring, especially if PMC 
is unsuitable. Multidisciplinary management is advised for patients with significant MS who are ineligible for valve intervention. 
15.2.3. Aortic and mitral regurgitation 
Non-cardiac surgery can usually be performed safely in asymptomatic patients with severe MR or AR and preserved LV function. If NCS is urgent, 
patients should undergo surgery under strict haemodynamic monitoring, 
regardless of symptom status. In cases of elective (non-urgent) NCS in 
patients with severe ventricular SMR, medical therapy should be optimized. If symptoms persist and NCS is intermediate or high risk, TEER 
should be considered after Heart Team discussion based on clinical

and anatomical selection criteria.194,584 Valve treatment should be performed for patients with AR meeting the criteria for valve intervention 
before any elective intermediate- or high-risk NCS.966,967 
15.3. Peri-operative monitoring 
Heart rate control (particularly in MS) and careful fluid management 
(particularly in AS and MR with reduced LVEF) are needed throughout 
the procedure. The involvement of specialized cardiovascular anaesthesiologists should be considered in complex situations because TOE 
monitoring may be considered. Pulmonary artery catheterization is 
not routinely used. 
16. Management of valvular heart 
disease during pregnancy 
Specific ESC Guidelines on this topic are available (the 2025 ESC 
Guidelines on cardiovascular disease during pregnancy) and should be consulted for further details.968 Pregnancies in patients with VHD should 
be considered high risk and managed under the close supervision of a 
cardiologist and a multidisciplinary Pregnancy Heart Team. The importance of midwives and other specialized nursing personnel is increasingly 
recognized for high-quality direct patient interactions. Shared decision- 
making is especially important when addressing the cardiovascular risk 
of pregnancy and the benefit–risk ratios of therapeutic options and 
modes of delivery (Figure 22). 
16.1. Management before pregnancy 
Ideally, women should undergo a thorough physical examination by 
their general practitioner for VHD screening prior to pregnancy. A specialized evaluation including TTE should be performed by a cardiologist 
in the case of clinical suspicion.968,969 
If VHD is diagnosed, pre-pregnancy counselling is imperative. 
Unplanned pregnancies in patients with VHD should be discouraged. 
Contraception methods should be recommended after discussion 
with the patient in the presence of a significant maternal and/or foetal 
risk. In patients contemplating pregnancy, the maternal risk should be 
assessed using the modified WHO classification and other scores such 
as the CARPREG or DEVI risk score (see Supplementary data online,  
Table S7).970

Before recommending pregnancy, the following conditions need to 
be corrected: 
• MS with MVA <1.5 cm2, even when asymptomatic.971 
• Severe AS with symptoms, or abnormal exercise test, or LV systolic 
dysfunction.972 
• Heritable aortic disorders and high risk of aortic dissection: prophylactic 
aortic repair is recommended prior to pregnancy in women with 
Marfan syndrome and an aortic diameter of >45 mm, and may be considered in women with an aortic diameter between 40 and 45 mm 
when risk factors for dissection exist.973 Aneurysmal dilation in women 
with BAV should be corrected when the aortic diameter is ≥50 mm.974 
Close follow-up in dedicated units and beta-blocker therapy during 
pregnancy and post-partum are recommended unless contraindicated, 
although strong evidence is only available for Marfan syndrome.  
Valvular regurgitant lesions are generally well tolerated during pregnancy. Prophylactic intervention is therefore not recommended in the 
absence of class I or IIa indications. 
The first therapeutic option for MS in a woman considering pregnancy should be PMC. When implantation of a prosthetic valve is necessary, BHVs are recommended, although early SVD remains a 
serious concern.975 Mechanical heart valves must be avoided due to 
the high risk of maternal and foetal complications linked to the potential 
teratogenic effects of VKAs, as well as the increased risk of bleeding.976 
The Ross procedure may be considered for the treatment of AV disease at centres with expertise. 
16.2. Management during pregnancy 
16.2.1. Patients with native valve disease 
Pregnancy can worsen the clinical course of left-sided stenotic valvular 
lesions because increased cardiac output causes an increment of transvalvular gradient of ∼50%, mainly between the first and second trimesters. Regurgitant lesions are less likely to cause complications, except 
in high-risk cases (LV systolic dysfunction, PH, and cardiac events before 
pregnancy).977 
Mild MS is generally well tolerated.978 Heart failure occurs in 
one-third of pregnant women with an MVA of <1.5 cm2 and in one-half 
of those with an MVA of <1.0 cm2, most often during the second trimester.971 Percutaneous mitral commissurotomy should be considered if symptoms or SPAP of >50 mmHg persist despite optimal 
medical therapy (diuretics and beta-1-selective beta-blockers), preferably after the 20th week of pregnancy. 
Regarding AS, pregnancy is generally well tolerated if prior exercise 
tolerance was normal, even in severe AS, while HF has been reported 
to occur in up to 25% of symptomatic patients.972 In symptomatic 
patients despite medical therapy (i.e. diuretics), TAVI seems to be 
the preferred option in very selected patients, although evidence is 
lacking. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty may be an alternative option. Procedures should be performed in an experienced valve 
centre.972,979,980 
Surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a high rate 
of foetal loss and should be restricted to conditions that threaten the 
mother’s life if transcatheter intervention is not possible or has failed. 
Vaginal delivery is the first choice for the majority of patients. 
Caesarean section is preferred if there is an obstetric indication, 
and in the case of severe MS or AS, ascending aortic diameter of 
>45 mm, severe PH, or if delivery starts while the patient is being 
treated with OAC. 
16.2.2. Patients with prosthetic valves 
Pregnant patients with MHVs should be followed in a centre with corresponding expertise. In a cohort of 212 women with MHVs, valve 
thrombosis occurred in 10 (4.7%) pregnancies and haemorrhagic 
events occurred in 49 (23.1%).976 Therapeutic OAC during pregnancy 
is essential to avoid thrombosis. The higher efficacy of VKAs compared 
with LMWH to prevent thrombosis must be balanced against increased 
foetal risks.981 
In patients requiring ≤5 mg/day of warfarin, OAC with warfarin 
throughout pregnancy, changing to UFH before delivery, is advocated, 
in order to reduce the risk of thrombosis. In patients requiring higher 
doses, switching to dose-adjusted LMWH at least twice per day with 
strict anti-Xa monitoring during the first trimester is recommended 
to avoid the teratogenic effect of VKAs (for corresponding flowcharts 
see the 2025 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy968). 
Lifetime management of women with a BHV considering pregnancy 
is central and transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation may be considered as a bridge to MHV implantation.982 
17. Sex-specific considerations 
in patients with valvular heart 
disease 
Although men and women are equally likely to experience VHD, sex- 
specific prevalence exists according to valve type and disease pathophysiology.644,648,983 Women more frequently suffer from MV disease 
such as prolapse, RHD or TR, while men more often present with AS or 
AR, especially associated with BAV.984 Men also suffer from endocarditis of any valve more frequently.985 
Female sex is associated with higher mortality in the presence of various VHDs,986 including early post-treatment,987 and is included as a 
risk factor in surgical risk prediction tools such as the STS and 
EuroSCORE calculators. However, risk scores are often derived 
from populations including a majority of men.988 In addition, risk prediction scores are susceptible to referral bias that results in a well- 
established higher risk of undertreatment or delayed treatment of 
VHD in women.983,984,986 
17.1. Aortic valve disease 
Female patients with severe AS present more often with shortness of 
breath, whereas males more frequently have angina, presumably due to 
the higher incidence of CAD.989 The pathophysiology of AS seems to 
differ according to sex, with women having less calcium and more fibrosis.990 Concentric ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling are also 
more frequently observed in women than in men, resulting in higher 
LVEF but smaller LV cavity and stroke volume.991 Consequently, paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient constellations are frequent and may 
both contribute to the underdiagnosis of severe AS in women and delay 
an intervention.992 The use of sex-specific thresholds to define flow 
limitation (<40 mL/m2 for men and <32 mL/m2 for women) has therefore been suggested,292 and the use of CCT to quantify the calcium 
score should be performed in women with discordant echocardiographic parameters.777 
Women are less likely to be referred to a cardiologist and 
undergo investigations. Surgical aortic valve replacement is performed less frequently in women, especially if echocardiographic 
parameters are discordant.993 In patients presenting with severe  
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               69

AS and Class I indications for SAVR, a significantly higher proportion 
of men than women are referred for evaluation by a cardiac 
surgeon.994,995 
Male patients derive a clearer benefit from SAVR compared with women, who have higher in-hospital and long-term mortality and morbidity,987,996 possibly explained by more severe concentric hypertrophy991 
and a smaller aortic annulus predisposing to PPM.997 Conversely, in a 
randomized trial (RHEIA) that compared TAVI with SAVR in 443 women with a mean age of 73 years, TAVI was superior in reducing the 
primary endpoint composed of death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 
1 year, predominantly driven by a reduction in rehospitalization for 
valve- or procedure-related symptoms or worsening HF.998 Several observational studies suggest that elderly women have lower mortality 
after TAVI,999 even if the rates of major vascular complications and 
bleeding tend to be higher.997 
Indexed cut-offs to indicate treatment of AR are validated, but only 
partially account for sex differences. Newer studies using echocardiographic volumes1000 and CMR1001 suggest that women may experience 
higher event rates at lower cut-offs compared with men, but this requires further investigation. 
17.2. Mitral valve disease 
Patients with RHD are often young women and have a high prevalence 
of major cardiovascular complications with far-reaching impacts on reproductive health and access to care.282 Although women experience 
favourable outcomes compared with men when treated by percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty, access to these procedures is still limited 
in low-income countries.662 
Fibroelastic disease with MV prolapse is also more frequent in women, and may be accompanied by morphological abnormalities of 
the MA associated with fibrosis of the papillary muscles or the inferobasal LV that may act as the substrate for sudden cardiac death, 
even in the absence of severe MR.1002 Recent evidence has supported considering lower women-specific cut-offs for intervention 
with regard to LVESD (36 mm; indexed LVESD, 1.8 cm/m2), while 
the LVEF cut-off was similar to men (58%), albeit with higher 
mortality.548 
Ventricular SMR associated with low LVEF is more frequent in men 
with HF,1003 while atrial SMR due to chronic AF and/or HFpEF affects 
more women (58% vs 42% male).579 
Female sex is a risk factor for the development of MAC and was reported to account for 68% of the patients included in a large-scale 
transcatheter MV replacement in MAC registry.1004 Furthermore, women present with a faster disease progression.1005 
17.3. Tricuspid valve disease 
Tricuspid regurgitation is more prevalent in women,208 and female 
sex is associated with accelerated disease progression.1006–1008 
Hypotheses to explain these observations include the overall higher 
prevalence of HFpEF and AF in women.1009 Women are usually 
diagnosed at an older age and the cause of TR is most frequently 
a consequence of left valvular disease or annular dilatation attributable 
to RA dilatation.1010 No differences have been detected to date 
in terms of adverse events after surgery1011 or transcatheter TV 
interventions.1012,1013 
18. Key messages 
Heart Team and Heart Valve Centre 
• An integrated regional Heart Valve Network incorporating outpatient Heart Valve Clinics and specialist Heart Valve Centres allows 
optimal patient care. 
• Heart Valve Centres should fulfil institutional and local statutory requirements, and strive for high procedural volume and excellent clinical outcomes. 
• Heart Team recommendations should be based upon these guideline 
recommendations, relevant updated evidence, key medical considerations, and patient preferences. 
• Core members of the Heart Team include the primary clinical cardiologist, cardiologists with subspecialty expertise in VHD, specialists in 
advanced cardiovascular imaging and peri-procedural imaging guidance, and surgeons and interventional cardiologists with training 
and expertise in valve interventions. 
• A network approach that distinguishes between higher- and 
lower-volume centres is appropriate, with more complex procedures focused in the most experienced (i.e. upper quartile) 
centres. Information on the network organization should be communicated to patients, as well as referring cardiologists and general 
practitioners.  
Aortic regurgitation 
• Assessment of AR severity with TTE remains challenging and current 
cut-offs for intervention are mostly based on 2D measurements, although 3D echocardiography and CMR allow more accurate evaluation of LV volumes and LVEF. 
• Mechanisms of AR may be closely related to the aortic diameters that 
should be measured accurately at all levels of the aortic root (annulus, 
sinuses, and sinotubular junction). 
• Indication for operation is based on symptoms, LV volumes, LVEF, 
and aortic diameters. Although valve replacement remains the standard treatment, AV repair (or AV sparing when associated with root 
aneurysm) is being increasingly used to avoid prosthesis-related complications, especially in experienced centres. 
• Current transcatheter options for AR are limited and applicable only 
in patients who are ineligible for surgery.  
Aortic stenosis 
• Diagnosis of severe AS requires integrative evaluation of pressure 
gradients (the most robust measurements), AVA, flow conditions, 
the extent of valve calcification, and LV function. 
• Selection of the most appropriate mode of intervention should take 
into account clinical characteristics (age and estimated life expectancy, concomitant conditions), access and valve anatomy (particularly 
the feasibility of transfemoral TAVI and calcification patterns), and 
surgical risk, as well as repeat procedure options and risks (lifetime 
management).  
Mitral regurgitation 
• The echocardiographic diagnostic workup of patients with MR includes multiparametric assessment of MR severity, evaluation of


<!-- PAGE 71 -->

### Page 71

MV anatomy (often with 3D TOE), identification of the mechanism 
(PMR, ventricular SMR, or atrial SMR), and evaluation of cardiac 
damage. 
• Surgical MV repair is the preferred method of treatment in severe 
PMR. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is recommended in patients 
who are inoperable or high risk according to the Heart Team. 
• Surgical MV repair is the procedure of choice for asymptomatic patients with primary MR and signs of cardiac damage, including moderate or more TR. 
• In patients with ventricular SMR, GDMT (including CRT if indicated) 
is the initial and essential treatment step. In symptomatic patients 
without CAD needing revascularization, M-TEER is recommended. 
In patients with concomitant complex CAD and those not suitable 
for TEER, mitral surgery may be considered. 
• In patients with atrial SMR, MV surgery, AF ablation if indicated, and 
LAAO should be considered after optimization of medical therapy. 
Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair may be considered in patients at 
high surgical risk.  
Mitral stenosis 
• Most patients with severe rheumatic MS and favourable valve anatomy should undergo PMC, which is the standard of care. Surgery 
is recommended for symptomatic patients with contraindications 
or unfavourable anatomical and clinical characteristics for PMC. 
• Decision-making in patients with unfavourable anatomy should take 
into account local PMC experience. 
• In selected patients with clinically severe degenerative MS and MAC, 
transcatheter intervention or surgery may improve symptoms.  
Tricuspid regurgitation 
• Concomitant TV repair is the preferred method for patients with 
left-sided valve pathology and associated moderate or severe TR. 
• The use of risk scores for the assessment of RV and secondary organ 
dysfunction should be strongly encouraged in patients with isolated 
severe TV disease. 
• In isolated severe TR without severe RV dysfunction, surgery should 
be performed at an early stage in patients at low operative risk. 
• In isolated severe TR patients at increased surgical risk, tricuspid 
TEER or transcatheter replacement should be considered to improve quality of life and RV remodelling, in the absence of severe 
RV dysfunction or pre-capillary PH.  
Tricuspid stenosis 
• TS is a very rare manifestation of acquired VHD in high-income 
countries. 
• TS is mainly associated with rheumatic valve disease, carcinoid syndrome, or enzymatic disorders such as Fabry’s or Whipple’s disease. 
• Treatment of symptomatic TS mainly involves surgical TV 
replacement.  
Multiple and mixed valvular heart disease 
• Transvalvular gradients and velocities reflect the combined burden of 
regurgitation and stenosis in mixed aortic and mitral disease. 
• Treatment decisions should be based on the assessment of symptom 
and functional status, cardiac damage, anatomical suitability, and the 
risk–benefit ratio of intervention and lifetime management 
considerations. 
• Patients with mixed moderate AS and AR have similar detrimental 
outcomes compared with those with severe isolated AS. 
• In transcatheter procedures, which allow a sequential approach, 
downstream lesions should be treated first to prevent potential 
haemodynamic deterioration and allow improvement of upstream 
lesions due to changing loading conditions and reverse 
remodelling.  
Antithrombotic treatment in patients with a mechanical 
heart valve 
• International normalized ratio therapeutic range should be balanced 
to the type and anatomical site of MHV, as well to the thrombotic risk 
profile of the individual patient. 
• Patient training, self-monitoring, and education can increase INR stability and TTR. 
• Minor or minimally invasive NCS procedures do not require VKA 
interruption in patients with an MHV. 
• In patients with an MHV undergoing elective major NCS, bridging 
may be omitted if the thromboembolic risk is low.  
Non-cardiac surgery 
• The risk of peri-operative cardiovascular complications related to 
surgery and to patient-specific factors should be evaluated and communicated to the patient and surgical team. 
• In patients with symptomatic severe AS requiring urgent high-risk 
NCS, BAV or TAVI should be considered prior to surgery. In patients 
planned for elective NCS, AV intervention is recommended prior to 
NCS.  
Pregnancy 
• In women with VHD, decisions regarding management before and during pregnancy should be taken after discussion by the multidisciplinary 
Pregnancy Heart Team. Unplanned pregnancies should be discouraged. 
• The following conditions should be corrected prior to considering 
pregnancy: 
– clinically severe MS (MVA <1.5 cm2), even when asymptomatic 
– severe symptomatic AS, or asymptomatic patients with impaired 
LV function or a pathological exercise test 
– heritable aortic disorders and high risk of aortic dissection. 
• Vaginal delivery is the first choice for the majority of patients. 
Indications for Caesarean section include pre-term labour in patients 
on OAC, severe MS or AS, aggressive aortic pathology, acute intractable HF, and severe PH. 
• Women with MHVs should be managed in expert centres.  
19. Gaps in evidence 
General aspects 
• Patient-reported outcome measures are infrequently reported 
in VHD studies. Patient-reported outcome measure-oriented studies 
are required to improve quality of life and patient satisfaction. 
• Methods to address underdiagnosis and undertreatment of VHD 
need to be identified and implemented.  
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               71

Heart Team and Heart Valve Centre 
• Structured research is required to investigate the relationship between procedural volume and clinical outcomes, in order to define 
minimum annual thresholds for individual operators and institutions 
undertaking surgical and transcatheter valve interventions. 
• There is a pressing need to ensure higher dispersion and adoption of 
interventions for VHD, especially in middle- and low-income countries.  
Conditions associated with valvular heart disease 
• CAD: 
– The prognostic value of functional assessment of stable, moderate 
coronary stenosis in VHD patients remains to be determined. 
– The optimal strategy (invasive vs non-invasive) for CAD assessment in specific VHD populations remains to be elucidated. 
– The optimal timing of PCI in patients with CAD undergoing TAVI 
is yet to be determined. 
– The benefit of complete coronary revascularization with CABG in 
patients with combined VHD and CAD requires further research. 
• AF: 
– It is unclear which patients with chronic persistent AF and concomitant VHD are deemed to be suitable for rhythm control 
therapy. 
– The protective effect against stroke of OAC with VKA or DOACs 
in patients after surgical or transcatheter LAAO remains to be 
determined. 
• Cardiogenic shock and acute HF: 
– The optimal treatment strategy in VHD patients presenting with 
cardiogenic shock and acute HF is unknown.  
Aortic regurgitation 
• Impact of early LV remodelling on prognosis in asymptomatic AR patients is unknown. 
• Prognostic value of CMR-derived indices in asymptomatic patients 
needs to be determined. 
• More data are required on long-term results of surgical AV repair for AR. 
• More evidence is required on transcatheter treatment options for 
AR, in particular using dedicated devices.  
Aortic stenosis 
• Better understanding of the pathophysiology of AS is needed to propose innovative medical therapy. 
• Further research is required on: 
– Refined prognostic markers to guide timing of intervention in 
asymptomatic patients. 
– The role of revascularization in patients with severe AS and asymptomatic concomitant CAD. 
– Further data on the long-term durability of transcatheter valves in 
comparison with surgical BHVs in younger patients. 
– The role of TAVI in patients with BAV AS and patients <70 years 
of age. 
– Results of intervention (valve or coronary) after TAVI or SAVR. 
– Determining the optimal lifetime management strategy for AS 
patients.  
Mitral regurgitation 
• The association between primary MR and ventricular arrhythmias requires more investigation, including the impact of intervention on 
ventricular arrhythmias. 
• More data are required on the role of TEER in patients with advanced HF. 
• Long-term results of TEER need to be further assessed, including the 
clinical relevance of transmitral gradients after treatment of both primary and secondary MR. 
• Results of ongoing trials comparing MV surgery with TEER in non- 
high risk primary MR patients are awaited. 
• Data on the mid- and long-term clinical impacts of transcatheter MV 
replacement are required. 
• More data on the clinical impacts of surgical and transcatheter treatment of atrial SMR are required.  
Mitral stenosis 
• The potential role of TMVI using dedicated devices in high-risk 
patients is to be determined, particularly those with severe 
MAC.  
Tricuspid regurgitation 
• The long-term risks and benefits of concomitant TV surgery in patients with less than moderate TR and annular dilatation undergoing 
left-sided valve surgery need to be determined. 
• Further investigations are required on the outcomes of TV intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe TR and RV dysfunction or 
significant dilation. 
• The importance of addressing concomitant AF in patients with TR 
needs to be investigated. 
• More data are required on the indications, timing, and long-term outcomes of TV repair and replacement for TV disease. 
• Better understanding is required of the respective role of surgery vs 
transcatheter TV therapy for TR treatment.  
Tricuspid stenosis 
• The role of transcatheter TV replacement remains unexplored in patients with TS. The most efficient way to achieve ventricular pacing in 
patients after TV replacement needs to be investigated.  
Multiple and mixed valvular heart disease 
• Further evaluation of the impact on outcomes and indication for 
intervention, as well as timing and modalities of intervention, is 
required.  
Prosthetic valves 
• Further development of current prosthetic valve devices is required 
to address their main complications (e.g. improved tissue processing 
to reduce degeneration of bioprostheses or new mechanical valve 
designs to reduce risk of thrombosis). 
• Antithrombotic drugs in MHV patients: 
– Whether UFH or LMWH should be preferred as bridging therapy 
after MHV implantation, as well as their timing and dosage, remains 
to be established. 
– For patients with MHV undergoing major NCS, the optimal post- 
operative management and bridging of VKA needs further 
investigation. 
– The role of pharmacogenomics for VKORC1, CYP2C9, and 
CYP4F2 in patients with highly variable INR, and low TTR or major 
vascular complications despite good adherence, should be further 
investigated. 
– More data on the risks and benefits of slow thrombolysis for valve 
thrombosis are required.

Pregnancy 
• More data are required on optimal management of anticoagulation in 
pregnant women with MHVs. Prospective studies comparing different antithrombotic regimens are lacking.  
Non-cardiac surgery 
• Clinical utility of scales for peri-operative risk evaluation needs to be 
determined.  
Sex-specific considerations 
• The development of sex-adjusted surgical risk prediction tools is required. 
• Additional data are needed to validate sex-specific cut-offs indicating 
interventions. 
• Further research is needed to investigate sex-related differences in 
the prognosis and treatment of specific valve diseases, especially 
TR.
