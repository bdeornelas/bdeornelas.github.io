8    More than 500,000 cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIED) are implanted in the
9    European Society of Cardiology countries each year. The role of cardiovascular imaging in patients
10   being considered for CIED is distinctly different from imaging in CIED recipients. In the former
11   group, imaging can help identify specific or potentially reversible causes of heart block, the
12   underlying tissue characteristics associated with malignant arrhythmias, the mechanical
13   consequences of conduction delays and can also aid challenging lead placements. On the other
14   hand, cardiovascular imaging is required in CIED recipients both for standard indications, and to
15   assess the response to device implantation, to diagnose immediate and delayed complications
16   after implantation, and to guide device optimization. The present clinical consensus statement
17   (Part 1) from the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging, in collaboration with the
18   European Heart Rhythm Association, provides comprehensive, up-to-date and evidence-based
19   guidance to cardiologists, cardiac imagers and pacing specialists regarding the use of imaging in
20   patients undergoing implantation of conventional pacemakers, cardioverter defibrillators and
21   resynchronization therapy devices. The document summarizes the existing evidence regarding the
22   use of imaging in patient selection and during the implantation procedure and also underlines

1    Introduction
2    More than 500,000 pacemakers and cardiac devices are implanted in the European Society of
3    Cardiology (ESC) countries each year (1). There is strong evidence that the implantation of cardiac
4    devices improves patients’ outcomes, while the evidence that cardiac imaging can improve patient
5    selection and performance of these devices is growing.
6    The role of cardiac imaging in patients being considered for cardiovascular implantable electronic
7    devices (CIED) is distinctly different from imaging in CIED recipients. In the former group, imaging
8    can help identify specific or potentially reversible causes of heart block, the underlying tissue
9    characteristics associated with malignant arrhythmias, the mechanical consequences of
10   conduction delays and can also aid challenging lead placements. Furthermore, this is an area of
11   ongoing vibrant research aimed at identifying and filling evidence gaps to improve or refine
12   strategies for selecting patients for implantation of different types of CIEDs.
13   On the other hand, cardiac imaging is required for standard indications in CIED recipients,
14   alongside to assess the response to device implantation, to diagnose immediate and delayed
15   complications after implantation, and to guide device optimization.
16   This document is the first (Part 1) of two clinical consensus statements on imaging in patients with
17   CIEDs and aims to provide comprehensive, up-to-date and evidence-based guidance to
18   cardiologists, cardiac imagers and pacing specialists regarding the use of imaging in patients
19   undergoing implantation of CIEDs: conventional antibradycardia pacemakers, implantable
20   cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRT). The
21   document summarizes the existing evidence regarding the use of imaging in patient selection and
22   during the implantation procedure and also underlines gaps in evidence in the field. The role of
23   imaging after device implantation is discussed in the second document (Part 2).

25   Methodology
26   This clinical statement statement is based on a review of the literature performed by the members
27   of the writing group. The clinical advice is based upon the evidence and/or consensus of the writing
28   group and is classified into several categories, as shown in Table 1.

2    I. General aspects of pre-implantation imaging
3    In the 2021 ESC guidelines on cardiac pacing and CRT, and 2022 ESC guidelines for the
4    management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and the prevention of sudden cardiac
5    death (SCD), imaging is recognized as a crucial tool to assess cardiac function and also to detect
6    the heterogenous conditions associated with conduction abnormalities, VA and SCD (2,3).
7    Accurately diagnosing the underlying disease state may have an impact on decisions regarding the
8    type of CIED that will be implanted (e.g. conventional antibradycardia pacing or ICD in
9    hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), lead to the initiation of disease-specific treatments (e.g. for
10   transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis or Fabry disease) or both (e.g. ICD and immunosuppression in
11   cardiac sarcoidosis) leading to improved patient outcomes. Regardless of the underlying disease
12   state(s), the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function by measuring LV ejection fraction
13   (LVEF) is a common step in the diagnostic work-up of patients being considered for CIED
14   implantation. An overview of the different LVEF cut-off values proposed by the current ESC
15   guidelines to help guide which type of CIED should be implanted in various underlying conditions
16   is shown in Figure 1. It should be noted that other imaging parameters, in particular assessments
17   of myocardial scar, can also be used to refine decision-making in patients being considered for
18   CIED implantation, particularly when LVEF is preserved (e.g. scar burden in hypertrophic
19   cardiomyopathy). In addition, pre-implantation cardiac imaging can also help identify the diverse,
20   mainly anatomical reasons that might lead to challenging CIED lead placement (Table 2). In this
21   introductory chapter, we discuss common aspects of pre-implantation cardiac imaging: the
22   assessment of LV systolic function and the use of imaging in potentially challenging lead placement
23   scenarios. Specific issues regarding the use of cardiac imaging to help guide the implantation of
24   the different types of CIEDs will be discussed in the respective chapters of this document.
25
26   1.1 Assessment of LV systolic function
27   The assessment of LV size and function plays a pivotal role in patients undergoing device therapy.
28   The general echocardiographic approach has been described in the EACVI/ASE document on
29   chamber quantification (4). In short, LV volumes and LVEF can be measured using two- (2DE) or



                                                                                                        4

             ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT / CLEAN COPY
1    three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). Calculations from linear measurements (e.g.
2    Teichholz and Quinones methods) are no longer advised. The standard method for 2D E volume
3    calculations is the biplane method of disk summation (modified Simpson’s rule) where LV volumes
4    are measured by tracing the endocardial borders in the apical four - and two-chamber views.
5    Although the biplane method was mostly used to assess LVEF in the landmark ICD and CRT clinical
6    trials, it is susceptible to inaccurate endocardial border tracing and contrast agents use is advised
7    to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV segments are poorly
8    visualized in apical views (4). Without contrast use, LVEF by 2DE and cardiovascular magnetic
9    resonance (CMR, the current imaging reference standard) may differ by ≥10% EF units in up to
10   26% of patients (5). Furthermore, (semi-) automated measurements based on speckle tracking
11   technology may be useful, as they reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. In general, caution
12   is advised to avoid foreshortening of the LV in 2DE apical views, which typically results in volume
13   underestimation and LVEF over- or underestimation (6). However, even when images are acquired
14   by experienced operators taking care to maximize the LV long axis on apical views, foreshortening
15   of the LV is frequently inevitable. LV volume quantification is further hampered by its reliance on
16   the assumption that the LV cross section can be described by a stack of ellipsoidal disks, which can
17   be inaccurate especially in the presence of local shape abnormalities such as aneurysms (7). These
18   issues are of particular relevance, given that small differences in LVEF (5%) might de termine
19   whether a patient is a candidate for an ICD or not (Figure 1).
20   In patients with LV dysfunction undergoing ICD implantation, 3DE LVEF is an independent
21   predictor of major arrhythmic events and improves arrhythmic risk prediction, with the potential
22   to change decisions to implant an ICD in 20% of patients (most of them having 2DE LVEFs within
23   ±10% from the threshold) (8). Therefore, when the value of 2DE LVEF is close to the cutoff for ICD
24   implantation (±5%) - particularly in patients with abnormal LV shape or extensive LV wall motion
25   abnormalities - 3DE or CMR may be helpful to confirm a patient's candidacy for primary prevention
26   ICD implantation (Figure 2).

1    1.2 Cardiac imaging in potentially challenging lead placement scenarios
2    Cardiac imaging reports should describe findings that may complicate CIED implantation (Table 2).
3    Pre-procedural imaging may influence the CIED insertion approach (transvenous right- or left-
4    sided, epicardial) or help anticipate complications and define the most effective implantation
5    technique.
6    CIED implantation in patients with complex adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) may be
7    particularly technically demanding due to complex anatomy, both before and after repair
8    procedures (9). These patients require a tailored approach, which should ideally be discussed by
9    a Heart team that includes imaging and ACHD specialists.
10   On the other hand, some mild‐to‐moderate complexity ACHD, such as atrial septal defect (ASD),
11   persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC), or dextrocardia may be unrecognized before the
12   conduction disorder occurs (10, 11) (Figure 3). While advanced screening for ACHD does not seem
13   justified, some clinical signs (e.g. heart murmur, cyanosis, digital clubbing, etc.) may raise suspicion
14   of ACHD. In this situation, if a routine TTE examination is not sufficient to confirm or rule out
15   clinically suspected ACHD, it is advisable to order appropriate imaging tests (e.g. CMR). PLSVC is
16   usually an incidental finding, and it should be suspected in the presence of a dilated coronary sinus.
17   The diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography (CT), CMR, or by an agitated saline
18   echocardiography study through the patient's left antecubital vein if bubbles reach the coronary
19   sinus before the right heart chambers (Figure 3). Use can be made of historical thoracic chest CT
20   scans where these are available. In the presence of PLSVC, left-sided CIED implantation can be
21   technically demanding. A right-sided approach is advised in these cases if a right superior vena
22   cava is present without an innominate vein (12). For these reasons, it seems prudent to use
23   imaging to confirm or rule out PLSVC in patients with dilated coronary sinus before CIED
24   implantation.
25   Patent foramen ovale (PFO) and ASD do not complicate CIED implantation per se. Still, care should
26   be taken that the lead does not cross into the left heart chambers, thereby increasing the risk of
27   stroke or systemic embolization (13). In addition, PFO increases the risk of paradoxical septic
28   embolism during transvenous lead extraction in patients with CIED-related infections (14). Whilst
29   it does not seem necessary to use agitated saline study and provocative maneuvers to



                                                                                                           6

             ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT / CLEAN COPY
1    systematically screen for PFO in patients undergoing CIED implantation, particular care should be
2    taken in patients with known PFO or ASD, to ensure proper lead placement at implantation using
3    multiple views.
4    Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right ventricular (RV) dilatation may interfere with lead
5    placement and subsequent stability, while the presence of a mechanical tricuspid valve (TV)
6    prosthesis may dictate the need for epicardial ventricular pacing or LV pacing through the coronary
7    sinus (9, 10, 11). In a small randomized study in patients with severe TR, the ventricular lead was
8    more easily and steadily located at the RV outflow tract septum than at the RV apex with shorter
9    fluoroscopy time and lower incidence of intra-procedural dislodgement (15).
10   Exceptionally, prominent embryonic remnants in the right atrium may pose a challenge to
11   pacemaker lead placement (16). A prominent Eustachian valve, Chiari network, and Thebesian
12   valve are occasionally seen in the right atrium as fenestrated membranes, ridges or webs
13   sometimes dividing the chamber into two cavities (Figure 3). On occasion, these structures may
14   entrap a pacemaker lead within the right atrium or interfere with coronary sinus cannulation,
15   resulting in prolonged procedure times, increased radiation exposure, failed lead implantation or
16   the surgical management of complication (17, 18).
17   If transthoracic (TTE) cannot provide sufficient information for pre-procedural planning,
18   transoesophageal (TOE) echocardiography, CT or CMR imaging can be used to depict complex
19   cardiac anatomy or vascular abnormalities.
20   Clinical advice


      It is advised to routinely assess LV systolic function in patients undergoing
      CIED implantation



      The echocardiographic 2D biplane method of disk summation is the standard
      method to calculate LVEF

      In patients with good acoustic windows, extensive LV wall motion
      abnormalities or borderline LVEF (i.e. ±5% around the cut-off for ICD
      implantation), 3D echocardiography, if available, is the preferred method to
      measure LVEF by ultrasound




                                                                                                      7

      If poor echocardiographic windows preclude a reliable assessment of LVEF,
      contrast echocardiography or CMR are advised



      Pre-implantation cardiac imaging reports should include the description of
      findings that may complicate CIED implantation



      Cross-sectional imaging with CT or CMR is advised in patients with suspected
      persistent left-sided SVC

4    II. Imaging of patients undergoing CIED implantation: RV pacing vs. CRT
5
6    In the 2021 ESC guidelines on cardiac pacing and CRT, cardiac imaging is recommended in patients
7    with symptomatic bradycardia to evaluate the presence of structural heart disease, to determine
8    left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and to diagnose potential causes of conduction disorders (2).
9    While degenerative conduction disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are considered the
10   most frequent causes of atrioventricular block (AVB) in elderly patients (2), an underlying aetiology
11   for AVB is not identified during standard clinical pre-implantation assessment in approximately
12   half of young–middle aged patients (19). Of note, young pacemaker-treated patients with
13   atrioventricular block have a 3- to 4-fold higher rate of the composite of death, hospitalization for
14   heart failure (HF), VA or aborted SCD when compared with a cohort of matched controls (20). In
15   line with this, by the 2021 ESC guidelines, myocardial tissue characterization with multimodality
16   imaging should be considered for the diagnostic-work up of specific pathologies associated with
17   conduction disorders requiring pacemaker implantation, especially in patients younger than 60
18   years (2). This age cut-off is provisional, as some cardiac conditions associated with conduction
19   disorders may be more frequent in elderly patients (e.g. transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis).
20



                                                                                                         8

1    2.1 Assessment of structural heart disease and the potential aetiology of conduction abnormalities
2    While echocardiography alone may be sufficient for the routine assessment of global and regional
3    LV systolic function in most patients, multimodality imaging may be needed to diagnose different
4    congenital or acquired cardiac pathologies associated with conduction disorders. Figure 4
5    illustrates several important roles for cardiac imaging in the assessment of patients presenting
6    with symptomatic bradycardia. Together with clinical data, a comprehensive multi-modality
7    imaging assessment may identify potentially reversible causes of conduction abnormalities (e.g.
8    acute ischemia, inflammation or infection) or previously undiagnosed cardiomyopathies or heart
9    valve disease, which may vary widely in phenotype and clinical expression. Furthermore, imaging
10   plays a role in determining the most appropriate type of CIED for a specific patient - those with
11   conduction disorders will be treated with conventional antibradycardia pacing or CRT (with or
12   without defibrillator capability) depending predominantly on LV systolic function but also on other
13   imaging parameters, in particular the extent of myocardial scar. Finally, the presence of clinical or
14   imaging red flags, regardless of LV systolic function, should trigger multimodality imaging protocols
15   to identify previously unrecognized cardiac or multisystemic diseases in patients presenting with
16   AVB thereby enabling disease-specific treatment (Table 3).
17   Identifying the AVB etiology should ideally be performed prior to CIED implantation, especially if
18   CMR is the part of the diagnostic algorithm. However, this may not be always possible due to time
19   constraints or limited availability of advanced imaging modalities or genetic testing; therefore,
20   diagnostic process can be completed after CIED implantation.
21   In the following, we briefly summarize the imaging approach to patients with various cardiac
22   pathologies leading to conduction abnormalities. Of note, according to the 2023 ESC guidelines
23   for the management of cardiomyopathies, contrast CMR is recommended in patients with
24   cardiomyopathy at initial assessment (21). This means that the majority of these patients will have
25   had prior imaging for review during consideration of device implantation. Further details can be
26   found in the respective ESC and EACVI scientific documents (21, 22, 23).

2    2.1.1 Acute myocardial ischemia
3    High-degree atrioventricular (AV) block most frequently occurs in patients with acute inferior or
4    inferolateral myocardial infarctions, but it may also complicate anterior infarctions (24).
5    If AV block does not resolve after revascularization or spontaneously (within a waiting period of at
6    least 5 days), permanent cardiac pacing is indicated (2).
7
8    2.1.2 Infective endocarditis
9    Conduction abnormalities are uncommon complications of infective endocarditis and should
10   always raise suspicion of perivalvular extension of the infection and an aortic root abscess (25)
11   (Figure 5). Due to the proximity of the AV node to the non-coronary aortic cusp and the anterior
12   mitral leaflet, complete AV block is most often associated with aortic or mitral valve endocarditis
13   (25). The sensitivity of TTE for the detection of perivalvular complications of infective endocarditis
14   is relatively low and the use of other imaging modalities, including TOE, CT, nuclear imaging
15   positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and single photon emission
16   tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) is advised, particularly in patients with clinically
17   suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis (26) (Figure 6).
18
19   2.1.3 Severe aortic stenosis
20   Conduction abnormalities are common findings in patients with aortic valve disease, particularly
21   in the presence of extensive valve calcifications and LV dysfunction (27, 28).
22   While permanent pacemaker implantation for conduction disturbances is relatively rare after
23   isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) (29), new-onset left bundle-branch block (LBBB)
24   and advanced AV block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation are common complications
25   of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) (30). The risk of pacemaker dependency after
26   TAVI is influenced by several patient- and procedure-related factors, some of which can be
27   assessed by CT (31, 32). Anatomic factors predisposing to pacemaker dependency after TAVI

1    between membranous septum length and implantation depth ≥3 mm (31, 32). Membranous
2    septum length is measured on preprocedural CT coronal views as the perpendicular distance from
3    the annular plane to the beginning of the muscular septum, while implantation depth is measured
4    at the final aortic angiogram as the distance between the lower end of the transcatheter heart
5    valve frame and the lowest part of the noncoronary cusp (31). Lower implantation depth and
6    oversizing have been identified as procedural factors associated with an increased risk of
7    permanent pacemaker implantation following TAVI (32). There is currently no evidence to support
8    pacemaker implantation prior to TAVI or extended rhythm monitoring after SAVR/TAVI based on
9    pre-interventional imaging data.
10
11   2.1.4 Myocarditis
12   Patients with acute myocarditis uncommonly present with high-degree AV block. In a
13   retrospective study of >30 000 patients with acute myocarditis, the incidence of high-degree AV
14   block was 1.1% with only a minority of these (23.5%) requiring a permanent pa cemaker (35).
15   However, Mobitz II or third-degree AV block can be seen in approximately 25% of patients with
16   giant cell myocarditis (36, 37, 38). Early diagnosis in patients with unexplained high-degree AV
17   block (particularly in those younger than 60 years) is worthwhile (2), as they may benefit from
18   immunosuppressive therapy.
19   The diagnosis of definite myocarditis has traditionally relied on endomyocardial biopsy. However,
20   multiparametric CMR imaging allows noninvasive tissue characterization and is now often used
21   clinically to make a diagnosis of myocarditis without the need for biopsy. According to the 2018
22   Lake Louise criteria (39), a CMR diagnosis of myocarditis is based on at least one T1-based criterion
23   (increased myocardial T1 relaxation times, extracellular volume fraction, or late gadolinium
24   enhancement, LGE) with at least one T2-based criterion (increased myocardial T2 relaxation times,
25   visible myocardial edema, or increased T2 signal intensity ratio).
26
27   2.1.5 Cardiac sarcoidosis
28   Cardiac sarcoidosis is usually suspected in younger patients (aged <60 years) presenting with
29   higher degree AV block (38). Whilst frequently accompanied by extracardiac features, isolated



                                                                                                       11

             ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT / CLEAN COPY
1    cardiac sarcoidosis can also occur. Accurate diagnosis is important because it may impact the
2    choice of CIED implanted and given the potential for clinical improvement with
3    immunosuppressive therapy but also the serious adverse side effects with inappropriate steroid
4    therapy.
5    The multimodality imaging approach to patients with suspected cardiac sarcoidosis includes
6    echocardiography, CMR and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed
7    tomography (18FDG PET/CT) (38). FDG PET/CT is useful in identifying active cardiac sarcoidosis
8    (Figure 7), and also allows the identification of extracardiac sites of active sarcoidosis. Careful
9    dietary preparation and clinical attention during reporting are required to distinguish true
10   myocardial FDG PET activity due to sarcoid from physiological FDG uptake in the normal
11   myocardium.
12
13   2.1.6 Cardiac amyloidosis
14   Atrial fibrillation and AV block are the most common rhythm and conduction disorders in cardiac
15   amyloidosis (CA) (40). In a retrospective cohort study of 369 patients with transthyretin (ATTR)-
16   CA, almost 10% of patients had high-grade AV block requiring pacemaker implantation at the time
17   of diagnosis, whilst an additional 10% developed high-grade AV block during a mean follow-up of
18   28 months (40). Echocardiography may reveal a typical pattern of biatrial enlargement and
19   mechanical dysfunction, a small pericardial effusion, ventricular wall and interatrial septal
20   thickening, small LV cavity and diastolic dysfunction, very reduced long-axis function and impaired
21   LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) with a basal-apical gradient (Figure 8). On CMR, CA presents
22   with a classic pattern of diffuse subendocardial or transmural LGE (including hyperenhancement
23   of the atrial walls), abnormal gadolinium kinetics (difficulties in nulling the myocardium) and
24   increased native T1 and extracellular volume (23, 41). Whereas these typical echocardiographic or
25   CMR findings are suggestive of CA, non-invasive diagnosis of ATTR-CA also requires bone
26   scintigraphy and increased myocardial uptake of a bisphosphonate-based radiotracer (uptake
27   equal to/greater than bone uptake) in the absence of a monoclonal gammopathy (light chain
28   amyloidosis) (Figure 9) (23, 41).

1    2.1.7 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
2    Registry data indicate that up to 10% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) require
3    permanent pacemaker implantation because of conduction disorders (42). According to the 2021
4    ESC guidelines on cardiac pacing, AV sequential pacing with short AV delay may be considered in
5    patients with HCM in sinus rhyhtm who have other pacing or ICD indications if drug -refractory
6    symptoms or baseline or provocable LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradients ≥50 mmHg are present (2).
7    Further, according to the 2023 ESC guidelines on cardiomyopathies, sequential AV pacing, with
8    optimal AV interval to reduce the LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient or to facilitate medical
9    treatment with beta-blockers and/or verapamil, may be considered in selected patients with
10   resting or provocable LVOT obstruction ≥50 mmHg, sinus rhythm, and drug-refractory symptoms,
11   who have contraindications for septal reduction therapies or are at high risk of developing heart
12   block following septal reduction therapies (21).
13   The mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of AV sequential pacing in HCM include
14   asynchronous LV activation and premature septal thickening, interactions with LV filling, negative
15   inotropic effects with reduced hypercontractility of the LV, limitation of abnormal mitral valve
16   motion and LV remodeling (43). Echocardiography can be used during AV delay optimization to
17   assess changes in LV outflow tract pressure gradient and LV filling patterns (Figure 10). Since the
18   success of the procedure depends on full ventricular capture, AV delay must be short enough to
19   fully capture the LV from the RV apex, but also long enough to allow the atrial contribution to LV
20   filling (43). In clinical practice, AV delay optimization is carried out in a step-by-step fashion using
21   surface electrocardiography (ECG) and TTE. The programmed AV delay should be changed
22   gradually until reaching an optimal value defined as the longest AV delay that preserves both full
23   ventricular capture (no fusion beats on ECG) and LV filling (no A-wave truncation on the pulsed-
24   wave Doppler of the mitral inflow).
25   The use of imaging in risk stratification for SCD in HCM will be discussed in a subsequent section
26   of this document. However, if a patient is being considered for pacing for LVOT obstruction, CMR
27   for scar assessment is advised to guide device selection (conventional pacemaker or dual chamber
28   ICD).

1    2.1.8 Fabry disease
2    In an international survey comprising 714 patients with Fabry disease, conduction abnormalities
3    were observed in 16% of patients, while 3% had a permanent pacemaker (44).
4    Echocardiographic features of the disease include biatrial enlargement, LV hypertrophy
5    (concentric, asymmetrical septal or apical), increased papillary muscle thickness, LV diastolic
6    dysfunction and RV hypertrophy (45) (Figure 8). Abnormal segmental longitudinal strain in the
7    basal and mid-inferolateral LV walls may precede thinning of these segments. On CMR, low native
8    T1 values are characteristic, whilst basal non-infarct inferolateral LGE can be observed in
9    approximately half of the patients with Fabry disease (46, 46).
10
11   2.1.9 Dilated cardiomyopathy
12   If previously unknown and unexplained LV or biventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction
13   (EF<40%) are discovered in a patient with an indication for permanent pacemaker implantation,
14   the patient will be treated with a CRT device rather than with conventional antibradycardia pacing
15   (2). If the clinical scenario permits, then decision-making regarding the type of CIED required
16   should involve heart team discussions after a thorough diagnostic work-up and a minimum of 3
17   months of optimal medical therapy. In the pre-implantation work-up, cardiac imaging is used to
18   rule out ischaemic heart disease and also to detect the presence and extent of myocardial
19   oedema, scarring, fibrosis, and infiltration in the dysfunctional myocardium (20). Accoording to
20   the 2022 ESC guidelines, CMR with LGE should be considered in patients with dilated
21   cardiomyopathy for assessing the aetiology and the risk of VA/SCD (3). If possible, CMR is advised
22   prior to CIED implantation to avoid artifacts and also device-related safety issues (particularly if
23   non-CMR conditional CIED will be implanted).
24
25   2.1.10 Hemochromatosis
26   Conduction disorders are seen in around 2% of hemochromatosis patients, while the most
27   common cardiovascular manifestations of hemochromatosis include arrhythmias, congestive HF
28   and pulmonary hypertension (23, 48). CMR is the method of choice for assessing patients with




                                                                                                      14

1    suspected hemochromatosis, as T2-star (T2*) mapping can reliably identify and quantify
2    myocardial iron accumulation (23, 46).
3
4    2.1.11 Chagas disease
5    Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important cause of
6    bradyarrhythmias and pacemaker implantation in endemic areas (49).
7    The disease is characterized by atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, HF,
8    thromboembolic events and sudden death (49). Cardiac imaging typically reveals thinning of the
9    LV walls (most commonly seen in the basal inferolateral and lateral walls), apical ventricular
10   aneurysms (with or without thrombi), impaired LV systolic function and pericardial effusions (49).
11
12   2.1.12 Cardiac tumors
13   Cardiac tumors are exceedingly rare, but may cause a wide spectrum of arrhythmias and
14   conduction abnormalities, depending on the type of the tumor and the site of involvement (50).
15   For instance, cardiac fibromas have a propensity to cause VA, while cystic tumors of the AV node
16   can cause sudden death despite pacemaker implantation. Although multimodality imaging,
17   particularly noninvasive tissue characterization with CMR imaging, can provide valuable
18   information regarding the nature of the mass, histopathological characterization remains the
19   diagnostic gold standard (51). Besides CMR, a structured imaging approach to patients with a
20   possible cardiac tumor may include TTE, TOE, contrast echocardiography, CT and PET (51).
21
22   2.2 Imaging in temporary cardiac pacing
23   Temporary pacing wire insertion is usually performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Vascular
24   ultrasound is very useful to guide central venous access and echocardiography can be used to help
25   temporary pacing lead positioning if fluoroscopy is not available (52). Ultrasound-guided jugular
26   vein puncture involves identification of the internal jugular vein (confirmed by compressibility of
27   the vessel), puncture of the vein and confirmation of the correct position of the wire in the internal
28   jugular vein lumen (Figure 11). Echocardiography-guided temporary pacing lead positioning is




                                                                                                        15

4    Clinical advice

      If clinical data or pre-implantation TTE raise suspicion of structural heart
      disease or specific cardiomyopathy, it is advised to evaluate the patient using
      the ESC guideline-proposed diagnostic algorithms


      If CMR is the part of the diagnostic algorithm, it is advised to perform this
      examination prior to CIED implantation


      Echocardiography and ECG are useful during AV delay optimization to assess
      changes in LV outflow tract pressure gradient and LV filling patterns in patients
      with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and AV sequential pacing


      Vascular ultrasound is useful to guide central venous access and
      echocardiography can be used to help pacing lead positioning if fluoroscopy is

7    III. Imaging of patients undergoing implantation of cardioverter defibrillators
8    Sudden cardiac death may be the first manifestation of previously unrecognized CAD or
9    cardiomyopathies, and multimodality imaging has an essential role in the evaluation of structural
10   heart disease of survivors. Most survivors will receive ICD therapy for secondary prevention unless
11   a reversible cause of SCD is clearly identified (3). On the other hand, although the causes of SCD
12   vary from frequent cardiomyopathies to rare channelopathies, decisions regarding primary
13   prevention ICD therapy were almost solely based on reduced LVEF. The undeniable role of LVEF
14   originates from the landmark ICD trials in which LVEF≤35%, usually assessed by 2D
15   echocardiography, was the main inclusion criterion (53). However, it has a modest predictive
16   accuracy, especially in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathies (54) and in the 2022 ESC
17   guidelines, a balanced, more personalized approach combining clinical, imaging and genetic data
18   was proposed (3). Various cardiac imaging modalities allow visualization of tissue characteristics


                                                                                                     16

1    (often myocardial scar/fibrosis) that can be associated with VA in a broad spectrum of
2    cardiomyopathies, but the lack of data from randomized trials currently limits their routine use for
3    the prediction and prevention of VA and SCD. Using CMR scar as a risk indication tool in non-
4    ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF ≤35% (on any imaging modality) is being tested in the ongoing
5    BRITISH randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05568069).
6
7
8    3.1 Imaging for identifying tissue characteristics that can be associated with ventricular arrhythmia
9    Assessment of myocardial scar and fibrosis, mechanical dispersion, inflammation, denervation and
10   impaired perfusion have all shown superiority to LVEF measurements in risk-stratifying patients
11   for SCD in observational studies (Figure 12). LGE on CMR represents the non-invasive reference
12   standard for the visualization and quantification of replacement myocardial fibrosis. The presence
13   and extent of LGE are strongly associated with VA in both ischemic and non-ischemic
14   cardiomyopathies (55, 56). Furthermore, in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, the size of the
15   peri-infarct grey (border) zone, composed of a mixture of normal myocardium and fibrosis, is
16   independently associated with VA, even after accounting for total myocardial scar burden (57).
17   Non-focal, diffuse myocardial fibrosis, often encountered in non-ischemic cardiomyopathies,
18   quantified by myocardial native T1 mapping and extracellular volume calculation, is also predictive
19   of VA even in the setting of normal LVEF and in the absence of LGE (58). The superiority of a CMR-
20   guided management strategy for ICD insertion in patients with LVEF 36-50%, based on the
21   presence of scar or fibrosis, to the current strategy based around an LVEF≤35% is being tested in
22   the ongoing CMR GUIDE trial (59).
23   The presence of myocardial scar or fibrosis can be indirectly evaluated by assessing their functional
24   consequences using myocardial strain and mechanical dispersion on speckle-tracking strain
25   echocardiography or less often by CMR feature tracking analysis. GLS was independently
26   associated with an increased risk of VA and the first appropriate ICD therapy in an unselected
27   cohort of ICD patients with structural heart disease (60). The ability of mechanical dispersion to
28   predict VAs has been shown in patients with long QT syndrome (61), post-myocardial infarction
29   (62, 63) and familial dilated cardiomyopathy (64). There are currently no randomized controlled



                                                                                                       17

1    trials reported or in progress to provide evidence for the superiority of either GLS or mechanical
2    dispersion over LVEF in VA or SCD prediction.
3    Nuclear imaging techniques have the ability to depict sympathetic denervation, perfusion defects
4    and cardiac inflammation, and thus identify the risk for VA and SCD. Cardiac scintigraphy with the
5    123-Iodine-labeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG), an analogue of noradrenaline, allows
6    evaluation of cardiac sympathetic activity (65). A heart-to-mediastinum ratio <1.6, calculated as
7    123I-MIBG accumulation in the heart divided by that in the mediastinum, has been identified as a
8    risk factor for VA and SCD in both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies (66). Similarly, in
9    ischemic   cardiomyopathy,     sympathetic      denervation   assessed    using   11-carbon-meta-
10   hydroxyephedrine PET predicted SCD independently of LVEF and infarct volume (67). Among
11   patients with CAD and LVEF>35%, the extent of stress perfusion defects on single-photon emission
12   computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging was associated with an increased
13   risk of SCD (68). Myocardial perfusion defects in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis can represent
14   areas of scar or inflammation, while 18F-FDG PET identifies areas of pathologic glucose uptake and
15   myocardial inflammation (38). Patients with cardiac sarcoidosis with both focal perfusion defects
16   and corresponding areas of inflammation (FDG uptake) were at higher risk of death or ventricular
17   tachycardia (VT) than those with either perfusion defects or inflammation alone (69).
18   Recently, cardiac CT (CCT) has emerged as a promising method for identifying the substrate of
19   malignant arrhythmias and in planning radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for refractory VT
20   (70, 71). In patients with contraindication to CMR, CCT identification of myocardial fibrosis was
21   feasible and accurate versus EAM electro-anatomical mapping during RFCA procedure (72).
22   Finally, a pilot study suggested that CCT might be a useful tool for planning, guidance and follow-
23   up of external stereotactic radioablation for the treatment of VT (73).
24
25   3.2 Valvular heart disease
26   In patients with valvular heart disease (VHD), VA and SCD may occur due to VHD -induced LV
27   dysfunction, hypertrophy and fibrosis, but also due to coexisting triggers (e.g. CAD in elderly
28   patients with aortic stenosis) (74). Whether surgical or interventional correction of VHD lowers
29   the risk of SCD remains uncertain although in aortic stenosis the burden of irreversible myocardial



                                                                                                     18

             ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT / CLEAN COPY
1    fibrosis appears to increase rapidly (with a relative annual progression of midwall LGE of 78%) until
2    valve replacement occurs and is closely related to long-term prognosis (75). Primary prevention
3    ICD implantation is indicated for patients who satisfy general guideline-proposed criteria (3). With
4    the exception of mitral valve prolapse, there is currently no solid data on the ability of cardiac
5    imaging to improve risk stratification for VA and SCD in patients with VHD.
6
7    3.2.1 Arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse and mitral annular d isjunction
8    MVP is characterized by >2 mm displacement of 1 or both mitral valve leaflets above the annulus
9    within the left atrium in end-systole (76) in the parasternal or apical long-axis views (Figure 13),
10   while MAD is defined as a separation between the annulus (i.e. left atrium wall-mitral valve
11   junction) and the LV wall (77). CMR is important for confirmation and for better visualization of
12   MAD, its location, quantification of MAD length, and most importantly, for detection of associated
13   LGE in the inferolateral wall and in the papillary muscles (78). Of note, MAD is a common finding
14   on CMR and it appears that only inferolateral disjunction warrants consideration of further
15   investigation (79).
16   The criteria for primary prevention ICD implantation in patients with AMVP are not established.
17   Risk markers for severe VA include arrhythmic syncope, frequent PVCs and non-sustained VTs,
18   reduced LVEF, presence of MAD, and papillary muscle or inferolateral LGE (78). Reduced LVEF has
19   repeatedly been reported as a risk marker for severe arrhythmic events in patients with AMVP.
20   However, the changes in LV function are often subtle, even occurring within the normal range of
21   LVEF. The presence of LGE is an important risk marker for events, and CMR is useful in patients
22   with MVP and an arrhythmic phenotype (78). A recent study showed that CMR T1 mapping was
23   associated with T-wave inversion on the ECG and with VA (80). These results indicated that diffuse
24   fibrosis may explain such ECG changes and may be promising for risk stratification in AMVP.
25
26   3.3 Inflammatory conditions
27   it has been shown that the burden, location and pattern of LGE may improve risk stratification in
28   myocarditis, including amongst patients with preserved LVEF (81). Patients with midwall
29   anteroseptal LGE have worse prognosis, in terms of cardiac death, appr opriate ICD therapy,



                                                                                                       19

1    resuscitated cardiac arrest, and hospitalization for HF, than those with other patterns or without
2    LGE (81). However, a prognostic threshold for LGE burden has not been defined; moreover, there
3    are no randomized trials showing the superiority of LGE over LVEF to facilitate decision-making for
4    primary prevention ICD therapy. In patients with cardiac sarcoidosis, LVEF<35% predicts
5    unfavorable outcomes, but VA can also occur in patients with preserved LVEF (82). Based on data
6    demonstrating that patients with LGE had more VA than those without it (83), the 2022 ESC
7    Guidelines inform that an ICD implantation should be considered in patients with cardiac
8    sarcoidosis who have a LVEF>35% but significant LGE at CMR after resolution of acute
9    inflammation (3). While the threshold for significant LGE extent was not specified, a recent study
10   suggested that a value of >5.7% had good accuracy for predicting a composite of SCD, significant
11   ventricular VA and appropriate ICD therapy (84). Also, LGE affecting ≥20% of the LV mass has been
12   associated with arrhythmic events in previous reports (85, 86). A widely accepted definition of
13   significant LGE is not available, partly due to the challenges of precise quantification of LGE burden.
14   In the absence of robust data, it seems prudent to use a lower LGE cutoff (>6%) for the prediction
15   of SCD or VA in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis (85, 87). Further studies are needed to refine
16   quantification and to determine the optimal cutoff.
17
18   3.4 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
19   Imaging is crucial for making a diagnosis of HCM, risk stratification and for decisions on primary
20   prevention ICDs. According to the ESC guidelines, a complete TTE study and CMR with LGE should
21   be performed in all patients with HCM (3, 21). Contrast echocardiography, 3DE and CMR may
22   increase the sensitivity of conventional TTE to detect apical HCM and apical aneurysms (88) (Figure
23   14). The ESC HCM risk calculator (89) is commonly used for estimating individual risk for VA. The
24   parameters in this risk calculator include age, maximum ventricular wall thickness, left atrial size,
25   maximum LV outflow gradient, family history of SCD, previous non-sustained VT, and unexplained
26   syncope. The prevalence of VA correlates not only with LV wall thickness, but also independently
27   with the presence of LGE on CMR (90). LGE has not been included in the ESC HCM SCD risk

1    LGE on CMR (usually defined as ≥15% of LV mass) or LV apical aneurysms, ICD should be or may
2    be considered if an estimated 5-year risk of SCD is intermediate or low, respectively (3).

4    3.5 Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
5    Imaging has an important role in risk stratification and planning for device implantation. Whilst
6    life-threatening arrhythmias can occur without overt structural changes in the myocardium (93),
7    the presence of structural abnormalities highly increases the risk of VA (94, 95, 96). RV structural
8    changes, particularly RV dilatation and RV dysfunction, indicate increased arrhythmic risk.
9    According to the 2022 ESC Guidelines, in patients with severe RV dysfunction (RV fractional area
10   change ≤17% or RVEF≤35%), an ICD should be considered (3). Importantly, any LV involvement
11   and dysfunction is associated with increased arrhythmic risk (97). In a risk calculation model
12   (arvcrisk.com), only RVEF by CMR was included as an imaging parameter (98, 99). Two recent
13   papers indicated added prognostic value may be provided by strain echocardiography in these
14   patients (96, 100).
15   Unfortunately, inappropriate shocks are frequent in ARVC patients and one third of patients
16   experience lead-related complications (101). Special ICD-related concerns in ARVC, compared to
17   other cardiomyopathies, include the younger age of patients at initial ICD implantation and their
18   higher level of physical activity. Most importantly, there are issues related to electrical contact of
19   the RV lead where areas of fibrosis and poor intracardiac signals may be prominent. Low sensing
20   values in the RV may exist already at the time of implantation whilst loss of sense values and
21   increased pacing threshold may also develop over time (102). In a recent study, no non-invasive
22   imaging parameters could predict lead complications (101).
23
24   3.6 Left ventri cular hypertrabeculation (left ventricular non-compaction)
25   Classical clinical manifestations associated with non-compaction include LV dilatation and systolic
26   dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias and thromboembolic episodes from the spongious left
27   ventricle (103). Risk stratification for primary prevention ICD follow those for heart failure (104).

2    3.7 Lamin A/C cardiomyopathy
3    Arrhythmic events are frequent in Lamin A/C cardiomyopathy and frequently occur before LVEF is
4    severely reduced (105). LGE on CMR is typically located in the interventricular septum and is
5    probably associated with AV conduction disease (105). Importantly, patients in need of pacemaker
6    due to AV block, should receive a 2-chamber ICD due to the increased risk of VA (3). The 2022 ESC
7    guidelines inform that CRT-D should be considered if the patient has AV-block and LVEF <50% and
8    a high frequency of ventricular pacing is expected (3). When a CRT is indicated for the treatment
9    of HF, patients with lamin AC cardiomyopathy demonstrate a good response rate to biventricular
10   pacing (106).
11
12   3.8 Brugada syndrome
13   Imaging has a limited role in risk stratification and device implantation in patients with Brugada
14   syndrome. However, there are preclinical reports and clinical case studies indicating a potential
15   overlap between ARVC and Brugada syndrome, with the RV outflow tract (RVOT) area as a
16   common region of arrhythmogenicity (107, 108, 109). A recent study confirmed that a dilated
17   RVOT was associated with VA on top of a spontaneous Brugada type 1 ECG pattern (107). By
18   contrast, a normal RVOT diameter (<32 mm or indexed RVOT diameter <18 mm/m2) was
19   associated with the absence of arrhythmic events in patients with Brugada syndrome with a
20   spontaneous type 1 ECG and previous syncope (109). These findings may indicate a possible
21   clinical value of repeated imaging assessments in risk stratification for ventricular arrhythmias.

4    IV. Imaging of patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)
5    CRT is an established therapy for patients with HF, reduced LVEF and a wide QRS complex who
6    remain symptomatic despite optimal medical treatment (104). Unfortunately, the rate of patients
7    without volumetric response to CRT remains stable in the range of 30-40% despite technical
8    improvements and accumulating experience (110). Current selection criteria are based on patient
9    symptoms, QRS width and morphology and LVEF (2, 104). In the 2010 focused update of the ESC
10   guidelines on device therapy in HF, mechanical dyssynchrony, assessed by time-to-peak velocity
11   parameters, was considered a useful tool for CRT patient selection in subgroups less likely to
12   respond to this treatment (e.g. a QRS width 120-150 ms) (111). However, its use has been refuted
13   by the disappointing results of a multicenter, observational study that questioned both the
14   accuracy and reproducibility of this approach (112). Furthermore, in the subsequent Echo-CRT
15   randomized controlled trial, mechanical dyssynchrony-driven CRT implantation not only failed to
16   reduce the rate of death or hospitalization for HF, but might even have increased mortality in



                                                                                                  23

             ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT / CLEAN COPY
1    patients with narrow QRS complexes (113). Over the past decade, the superiority of novel
2    approaches for mechanical dyssynchrony assessment over time-to-peak parameters, and their
3    favourable association with CRT outcome has been repeatedly shown in observational studies
4    (114, 115, 116, 117, 118). However, guideline recommendations for CRT patient selection are not
5    likely be refined before the accuracy and reproducibility of novel parameters are supported by
6    evidence from randomized controlled trials. Finally, the response to CRT is no longer considered a
7    binary variable, since patients who either improve or stabilize after CRT fare better than those
8    with disease progression despite CRT (119, 120, 121, 122).
9    In the following section we discuss all potentially useful imaging parameters, acknowledging that
10   several are beyond current guideline criteria and also revisit the relationship of different response
11   metrics with patient outcomes after CRT.
12
13   4.1 Assessment of the mechanical consequences of conduction delays
14   4.1.1 Atrioventricular dyssynchrony
15   Prolonged AV conduction can lead to impaired LV diastolic filling and thereby reduced LV preload
16   and stroke volume. This type of dyssynchrony can be assessed with pulsed-wave-Doppler
17   echocardiographic recordings of the mitral valve inflow, typically characterized by reduced LV
18   filling time leading to fusion of the early (E) and late (A) diastolic waves (Figure 15), which
19   nevertheless is also favoured by higher heart rate in normal individuals. An LV filling time <40% of
20   the total cardiac length denotes significant AV dyssynchrony (123). CRT allows control of the
21   atrioventricular interplay which contributes in part to the favourable effects of CRT via improved
22   AV coupling (124), but also by allowing optimal beta-blocker treatment while avoiding AV block.
23   Of note, the AV delay can also be programmed in dual chamber pacing.
24
25   4.1.2 Interventricular dyssynchrony
26   The time difference between RV and LV ejection defines interventricular mechanical dyssynchrony
27   and can be determined from pulsed-wave-Doppler traces as the time elapsed between the onset
28   of flow in the RV and LV outflow tract (Figure 15). A time delay >40 ms is considered a significant




                                                                                                       24

1    interventricular mechanical delay, but does not predict CRT response with sufficient accuracy for
2    clinical use (112).
3
4    4.1.3 Intraventricular dyssynchrony
5    Intraventricular dyssynchrony refers to the dyssynchronous motion or deformation of the
6    different regions of the left ventricle. Alternatively, the term “LV mechanical dyssynchrony” is used
7    to distinguish it from the electrical phenomena seen on the ECG. Intraventricular dyssynchrony is
8    not well defined and many, mainly echocardiographic parameters have been proposed for its
9    measurement. Early dyssynchrony parameters were mostly based on time-to-peak tissue velocity
10   or strain measurements and could sensitively detect mechanical dyscoordination among the
11   different regions of the LV and were therefore sensitive criteria for the detection of LV mechanical
12   dyssynchrony (125, 126, 127, 128). However, time-to-peak measurements demonstrated poor
13   specificity (129) and therefore failed to selectively identify patients who would benefit from CRT
14   and did not provide added value beyond established guideline criteria (112, 113). In order to
15   improve patient selection by cardiac imaging, it is therefore important to find selection criteria
16   which are not only sensitive, but also specific and to identify motion or deformation patterns that
17   are amenable by CRT (Figure 16).
18
19   4.1.3.1 Intraventricular dyssynchrony amenable to resynchronization
20   Typical LBBB causes early activation of the septum and delayed activation of the lateral wall (Figure
21   16). The septal activation ends diastole when the cavity pressure and the load on the septal
22   myocardium is low. The delayed contraction of the lateral wall then bears the main work load of
23   systolic ejection while the septum is stretched (Figure 16). The septal stretching can be observed
24   as a short “notching” in the strain curve of a still functioning septum in early stages of
25   cardiomyopathy, but may become holosystolic when the septum is thin and weak in more
26   advanced states of LV remodeling (130, 131). In animal models, the imbalance in loading of the
27   septum and lateral wall has been shown to lead to progressive atrophy of the septum, hypertrophy
28   of the lateral wall and dilatation of the LV (132, 133), changes which can also be observed in
29   patients (132). Furthermore, the uncoordinated contraction and relaxation pattern of the LV



                                                                                                       25

             ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT / CLEAN COPY
1    myocardium causes a slower LV pressure rise and decay and hence longer isovolumic contraction
2    and relaxation times, respectively. As a consequence, LBBB shortens LV filling time and impairs LV
3    function in a similar way as described above for AV dyssynchrony (Figure 15).
4    Regional LV deformation patterns in LBBB have to be distinguished from those caused by
5    myocardial ischemia or scar. In ischemic and scarred myocardium, a reduced shortening in systole
6    and a delayed shortening peak after aortic valve closure (post-systolic shortening) are common
7    findings (134). If only the temporal occurrence of myocardial deformation peaks is considered, a
8    ventricle with scar shows a “dispersion” of shortening peaks across affected segments which are
9    not recruitable and cannot be therefore resynchronized (Figure 17). LV dispersion has been shown
10   to be related to the risk of life-threatening arrhythmia (62). However, mechanical dispersion
11   should not be used in the context of dyssynchrony assessments, since it is sensitive to both
12   ischemic and conduction disease substrates (135).
13   In ischemic cardiomyopathy with conduction delay, the typical LBBB pattern of intraventricular
14   dyssynchrony may be complicated by regional dysfunction due to scar (136). Such hearts show a
15   mechanical dyssynchrony, but not all patterns of dyssynchrony may be improved by CRT. It is
16   therefore of utmost importance that imaging parameters used to identify potential CRT
17   responders are specific enough to identify dyssynchrony patterns which are amenable by CRT
18   (114). Several novel parameters of mechanical dyssynchrony have been successfully tested in
19   observational studies (115, 116, 117), but all are lacking supportive evidence from prospective,
20   randomized trials. Mechanical dyssynchrony as a selection criterion for CRT is currently being
21   tested in the ongoing randomized AMEND-CRT trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04225520).
22
23   4.1.4 Other imaging modalities to detect LV mechanical dyssynchrony
24   In theory, any imaging modality with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution may be used to
25   identify the typical deformation patterns described above. Modern 3D echocardiography can
26   reach a sufficient temporal resolution, and can provide time-aligned information on the
27   deformation of all segments of the LV within one acquisition. Obtaining speckle tracking
28   echocardiographic 3D data sets with good regional quality, however, is challenging , has low
29   feasibility and reproducibility and, in its current form, limited added value over 2D approaches



                                                                                                    26

             ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT / CLEAN COPY
1    (137). CMR sequences with sufficient frame rate are available and tracking methods can be applied
2    similar to echocardiographic images. However, regional tracking with CMR demonstrates poor
3    reproducibility and must be used with caution (138, 139). Radial tracking, tagging approaches and
4    velocity-encoded imaging sequences may provide better results but require cumbersome post-
5    processing. CT data, when acquired throughout the entire cardiac cycle with ECG-tagging, may
6    also have sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to assess LV dyssynchrony (140), but the
7    disadvantage of ionizing radiation. Whilst scintigraphic methods have limited temporal and spatial
8    resolution, they can provide dyssynchrony information through analysis of the amplitude
9    (reflecting wall thickening) and phase (reflecting the timing of regional wall motion) of tracer
10   uptake. Studies have suggested the use of the standard deviation of phase–related parameters as
11   a potential criterion (141, 142). Of note, scintigraphy also has the disadvantage of ionizing
12   radiation.
13
14   4.2 Assessment of heart failure aetiology
15   Current ESC guidelines (2) give common recommendations for CRT implantation regar dless of HF
16   aetiology, since randomized clinical trials showed similar benefit in terms of mortality and HF
17   hospitalizations between patients with ischemic or non-ischemic HF. However, the same ESC
18   guidelines recognize that patients with an ischaemic aetiology have less improvement in LV
19   function after CRT, probably due to presence of myocardial scar tissue, which is less likely to be
20   associated with favourable remodelling. Nonetheless, guideline-proposed recommendations to
21   consider implantation of CRT-D rather than CRT-P are based on individual risk assessment that
22   includes, among other factors, ischemic aetiology of HF and the presence of myocardial fibrosis
23   (2). Echocardiography represents the first-line imaging modality for the characterization of LV
24   function, and may give important suggestions regarding HF aetiology. However, CMR with LGE is
25   considered the reference standard assessment of cardiac structure and function as well as
26   uniquely providing information on myocardial scar pattern, extent and location. Such scar is
27   typically subendocardial or transmural in patients with ischemic heart disease, as compared to the
28   mid-wall or subepicardial scar in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. In a prospective,




                                                                                                    27

1    observational study, pre-implantation scar assessment by CMR was predictive of appropriate ICD
2    therapies and SCD in CRT patients (143) while data from randomized studies are currently lacking.
3    Pre-implantation stress imaging (including echocardiography, and nuclear or CMR perfusion
4    imaging) may be used for the assessment of inducible ischaemia and viability in those being
5    considered for coronary revascularization. The integrated use of different imaging modalities may
6    therefore help optimise patient selection for CRT and maximise cost-effectiveness.
7
8    4.3 Assessment of scar burden and localization
9    Approximately half of patients referred for CRT have an ischemic aetiology of HF. The presence,
10   location and extent of scar tissue determines response to CRT. Lateral scar is an impediment for
11   efficient LV free wall pacing. It reduces CRT response and increases the risk of HF, hospitalization
12   and death (144, 145). When analysing mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with LBBB, lateral scar
13   leads to pseudo-normalization of septal deformation patterns (146). Septal strain curves therefore
14   always need to be interpreted in the context of the lateral curves (117). Septal scar reduces the
15   chances of septal functional recovery and can therefore also be detrimental to successful CRT
16   (147). LV lead deployment over non-scarred myocardium, as assessed by LGE-CMR, was associated
17   with a higher percentage of LV reverse remodeling and better clinical outcomes after CRT (148,
18   149). However, randomized trials have not unequivocally demonstrated that the guidance of LV
19   lead implantation based on imaging (assessing myocardial scar or site of latest mechanical
20   activation) is superior to an electrically guided CRT strategy (2, 150, 151).
21   Perfusion defects at rest on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron
22   emission tomography (PET) generally indicate the presence of scar tissue. However, in the
23   presence of dyssynchrony, reduced septal tracer-uptake may also be caused by partial volume
24   effects in the thinned septum as well as the lower work and reduced metabolism in this LV region.
25   The extensive LV contraction abnormalities induced by LBBB cause regional myocardial metabolic
26   and structural remodeling, even in the absence of reductions in blood flow. Therefore, reduced
27   septal tracer uptake does not necessarily indicate scar and the accuracy of nuclear methods to
28   identify scar tissue is reduced in patients with LV dyssynchrony (Figure 18) (152, 153). However, a




                                                                                                      28

1    matched perfusion/metabolism defect on PET imaging can detect true scar in patient with LBBB
2    (154).
3
4
5    4.4 Response to CRT
6    4.4.1 Definitions of response
7    Favorable effects of CRT can be observed immediately as well as over the mid- and the long-terms
8    (Table 4).
9    Correction of conduction abnormality can immediately translate into favorable hemodynamic
10   changes such as increases in blood pressure, cardiac output, dP/dt, LV filling period, as well as
11   decreases in mitral regurgitation (MR) and signs of dyssynchrony (117, 155). Mid to long term
12   effects of successful resynchronization include LV reverse remodeling (156, 157), decreased MR
13   (158), increased EF, improved LV diastolic function (159), LA function (160) and RV function (161),
14   as well as reductions in both VA (156, 162) and atrial fibrillation (160). Overall, these effects
15   improve the well-being and functional capacity of patients and reduce the need for diuretics, the
16   rate of recurrent hospitalizations, cardiac and overall mortality.
17   CRT response rate is however challenging to assess and varies significantly based on the definition
18   of response, and which of the above parameters are included (163, 164). Response rate based on
19   clinical endpoints (such as New York Heart Association class or quality of life scores) is higher than
20   the response rate based on LV reverse remodeling assessed by imaging (165). Changes in
21   echocardiographic markers of reverse remodeling remain the most commonly used surrogate
22   endpoints of CRT response (157). LV reverse remodeling is usually defined by a decrease in end-
23   systolic volume (ESV) of >15% compared to baseline or by an absolute increase in LVEF of >5-10%.
24   On this basis, nonresponse has been detected in 30-40% of patients (157, 163, 165). However,
25   the agreement between improved patient functional status and these markers of reverse
26   remodeling is only modest (163, 166, 167). Reverse remodeling most likely translates into
27   favorable outcomes, but lack of reverse remodeling is not equivalent to non-response in all
28   patients (119, 120). In some patients LV volume “stabilization” (i.e. no further volume expansion)
29   after CRT may already be a favorable effect providing a survival benefit (167, 168, 169) as many
30   assumed non-responders demonstrate a deterioration in cardiac performance when thei r device


                                                                                                        29

              ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT / CLEAN COPY
1    is switched off (121) (Figure 19). In addition, repeat echocardiography is not well suited to
2    detecting more subtle changes in cardiac structure and function due to the inherent variability in
3    echocardiographic biplane volume measurements. Furthermore, it remains difficult to define the
4    optimal time point at which to evaluate the response to treatment, given the continuous
5    remodeling and dynamic nature of heart failure (168). In the recent ADVANCE CRT registry,
6    recurrence of clinical heart failure was a stronger marker of a poor prognosis than a lack of
7    echocardiographic reverse remodeling among patients with LBBB receiving CRT (169). From that
8    perspective, it is challenging to dichotomize response to CRT using LV reverse remodeling or any
9    other standalone marker as a surrogate of clinical outcome.
10   Composite clinical scores (CCS) may be a more appropriate tool to evaluate the effect of CRT (119,
11   122, 170) because slowing down the progression of the disease is a positive outcome and is not
12   necessarily associated with reverse remodeling. This is particularly evident in patients with
13   ischemic cardiomyopathy who manifest less reverse remodeling but demonstrate a similar risk
14   reduction after CRT for HF admissions and death as the non-ischemic group (171).
15   In a subset of patients, super-response is observed. This is usually defined as LVEF increase above
16   50% together with a decrease in ESV of >15%, although a universal definition of super response to
17   CRT does not exist. Independent of the definition, however, super responders with pronounced
18   LV reverse remodeling do demonstrate superior clinical outcomes (162, 172).
19
20   4.4.2 Imaging predictors of response
21   Several imaging parameters have been developed recently to predict response to CRT (115, 116,
22   173). Accumulated evidence from several non-randomized studies suggests that these
23   parameters, discussed below, could be a useful addition for CRT patient selection.
24

25   4.4.2.1 Visual echocardiographic analysis

26   Early activation of the septum in LBBB causes a short and rapid inward motion of the septum which
27   is commonly referred to as “septal flash” (Figure 16) (173). Septal flash is a very sensitive
28   parameter, but may lack some specificity as it may appear even if relevant parts of the septum are
29   ischemic scar. Nevertheless, it has been shown to identify CRT responders with good accuracy


                                                                                                     30

1    (115, 173). A low dose dobutamine challenge increases mechanical dyssynchrony and can help to
2    unmask septal flash in a minority of difficult cases (174, 175). “Apical rocking” describes the typical
3    LV motion pattern caused by LBBB conduction delay. Early septal contraction at end-diastole pulls
4    the LV apex towards the septum, whilst lateral wall contraction then causes pronounced lateral
5    motion of the apex during the ejection phase (176). Detecting this apical rocking pattern has been
6    demonstrated in several studies to be both sensitive and specific for CRT response and strongly
7    associated with successful outcome after CRT (115, 177). Apical rocking is also related to
8    favourable outcome in patients undergoing upgrade from regular pacing to CRT and in CRT
9    recipients with a QRS <150 ms (115, 178). Apical rocking is diminished in the presence of scar,
10   which is advantageous in the assessment of CRT candidates with ischemic cardiomyopa thy (147).
11   Both septal flash and apical rocking are relatively simple markers that can be obtained by visual
12   inspection of routine 2-dimensional cine-loops, and do not require any further quantitative off-
13   line analysis. These visual phenomena are consistent with studies of more quantitative measures
14   of systolic stretch by strain imaging, and likely relate to the same electromechanical
15   pathophysiology (Figure 16).

16
17   4.4.2.2 Quantitative echocardiographic analysis of the LV
18   Echocardiographic strain imaging enables quantification of LV segmental deformation and is
19   therefore a useful aid for the analysis of global as well as regional LV mechanical function. An
20   increased baseline value of absolute GLS, an integral measure of apex -to-base myocardial
21   deformation, has been shown to be strongly associated with LV reverse remodelling and clinical
22   outcome after CRT (117, 179).
23   Several studies have analyzed septal strain patterns as predictors for CRT response (130, 180, 181).
24   In early disease, the delayed lateral wall contraction causes a short “notching” in the septal strain
25   curve, while in advanced disease, the septum shows systolic stretching (Figure 16). It has recently
26   been suggested that systolic septal stretching increases over time, reflecting LBBB -induced
27   ventricular remodelling (157). This may explain why dyssynchrony indices incorporating septal
28   stretch are sensitive and specific for volumetric response and strongly associated with clinical
29   outcome after CRT (117, 134, 180, 181, 182).



                                                                                                         31

1    More recently, the calculation of segmental myocardial work has been suggested. For this,
2    segmental pressure-strain- (or stress-strain-) loops are constructed utilising echocardiographic
3    speckle tracking strain and an estimate of the LV pressure (183) (Figure 20). Regional work
4    distribution is associated with LV remodelling in LBBB (184) and reverse-remodelling after CRT
5    implantation (185) and has been suggested as a predictor of CRT response (186, 187). In a recent
6    observational prospective multicentre trial, the LV lateral wall to septal work difference as a single
7    parameter proved to have similarly good predictive value as visual analysis by septal flash and
8    apical rocking (116). When either method is combined with assessment of septal scar by CMR, CRT
9    response is predicted with significantly higher accuracy than the former approaches alone (116,
10   188).

11
12   4.4.2.3 Left atrial function
13   Although most of the studies investigating the role of imaging in CRT response prediction focussed
14   on LV function, a recent study has demonstrated that baseline left atrial reservoir function,
15   assessed with echocardiographic strain imaging, is independently associated with volumetric CRT
16   response (159). Furthermore, imaging studies have shown that left atrial reverse remodeling is
17   independently predictive of long-term survival after CRT implantation (189, 190).
18
19   4.4.2.4 RV function
20   RV function is an independent prognostic marker in CRT recipients (191, 192) and should be
21   routinely assessed before and after device implantation. Although simple echocardiographic
22   parameters, such as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, were predictive of all -cause
23   mortality in patients undergoing CRT (193), it appears that RV free wall strain provides incremental
24   prognostic value over conventional RV function parameters in CRT recipients (161, 194). However,
25   it should be noted that improvement in RV function may occur in parallel with the improvement
26   in LV function after CRT, identifying patients with the best prognosis (195).

2    4.5 Coronary venous anatomy assessment
3    The coronary venogram is a key step for CRT implantation, and selecting the optimal site for LV
4    lead placement. This is performed during fluoroscopy at the time of CRT implantation. The
5    placement of a lead dedicated to LV stimulation occurs most commonly via the coronary veins,
6    targeting the LV free wall. It is thus mandatory to have precise knowledge of the coronary venous
7    anatomy to guide lead placement and to troubleshoot potential barriers in achieving a stable lead
8    position. The coronary sinus drains the blood collected by the network of coronary veins into the
9    right atrium (Figure 21). The length and size of the coronary sinus is highly variable, depending on
10   the preferential development of certain coronary veins with respect to others during the
11   embryonic phase. Moreover, LV or biventricular dilatation and hemodynamic overload due to the
12   underlying cardiac disease may also change the size and length of the coronary veins, displacing
13   the atrioventricular plane, and further influencing the unique anatomic pattern of the coronary
14   venous circulation in each patient. Thus, when planning LV lead placement, it is more clinically
15   useful to consider the vein to be targeted based on the region of the left ventricle where the LV
16   lead should be located, rather than any anatomic classification based on the take-off point of the
17   vein at the CS junction (Figure 21). Based on the electromechanical delay imposed by LBBB, the
18   mid-basal lateral, antero- or postero-lateral veins are the preferential lead locations (196). The
19   anatomical representation of these regions is obtained by recording a coronary venogram in RAO
20   20-30° and LAO 40-60°. The RAO view (similar to the two chamber view on imaging) displays the
21   LV regions and the coronary veins course in full length from base to apex of the heart, thereby
22   enabling the visualization of its basal, mid and distal segments, and the location of the junctions
23   between the coronary veins and the coronary sinus from the middle cardiac vein inferiorly to the
24   anterior interventricular vein and great cardiac vein superiorly (Figure 21). The LAO view (similar
25   to the short axis view on imaging) enables distinction of the anterior, lateral, posterior, and inferior
26   segments of the LV (Figure 21). Separation of the LV and RV pacing leads is therefore well
27   appreciated on this view. It is well known that coronary veins may have several connections
28   between each other creating a venous network that spreads form the apex to the base of the
29   heart and which ultimately drains into the coronary sinus and right atrium (Figure 21).



                                                                                                          33

             ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT / CLEAN COPY
1    Anatomical variants of the thoracic venous system are not rare, with persistence of the Marshal
2    vein or the left superior vena cava being the most common (Supplementary material online)
3    (Figure 3). This latter variant makes LV lead placement challenging, especially in the absence of a
4    right superior vena cava (197). Anatomic variants are more frequent in patients with congenital
5    cardiac disease. Pre-operative cardiac imaging in these congenital heart disease patients with
6    echocardiography, CMR and CT scans are mandatory for proper planning of CRT procedures, to
7    balance different opportunities during implantation. Indeed, in the event of atresia of the coronary
8    sinus ostium (Supplementary material online), or lack of suitable veins leading to the targeted LV
9    location, alternative strategies such as His bundle pacing or left bundle branch area pacing may be
10   considered before resorting to a leadless CRT implantation or to epicardial LV lead placement
11   (198). Intraoperative integration of three dimensional imaging with the coronary venogram in
12   theatre can improve targeting of the most mechanically delayed and viable myocardial segments,
13   and can enhance patients’ outcome (Figure 22) (149, 199, 200, 201). Of note, electrical delay to
14   the LV lead (Q-LV interval) has also been shown to be associated with favorable outcome, and may
15   be simpler to measure than mechanical dyssynchrony parameters (202).
16
17   Clinical advice

      Imaging is useful to assess LV mechanical dyssynchrony, myocardial scar extent
      and location and RV function to obtain prognostic information in patients
      undergoing CRT


      Patients with CRT should be categorized as “improved” “unchanged,” and
      “worsened” on the basis of composite clinical score rather than dichotomized
      as “responders” and “non-responders “ by LV reverse remodeling or any other
      standalone imaging marker



      Intraoperative and in certain cases pre-operative imaging of the coronary
      venous anatomy is advisable for targeted LV lead placement

1    CONCLUSIONS
2    In patients undergoing CIED implantation, imaging is pivotal to assess cardiac function and to
3    potentially detect disorders causing conduction abnormalities or malignant arrhythmias. Imaging
4    can also provide crucial information for deciding the most appropriate type of CIED and avoid
5    problems with challenging lead placements. Randomized controlled trials are eagerly awaited to
6    inform whether novel imaging parameters could further improve risk stratification for primary
7    prevention ICD implantation and refine criteria for CRT patient selection.

11
12   In patients presenting with symptomatic bradycardia, cardiac imaging is used to assess LV systolic
13   function, but also to detect possible transient causes or previously unrecognized structural
14   abnormalities leading to conduction disorders. If clinical red flags or pre-implantation
15   echocardiography raises suspicion of structural heart disease (SHD) or specific cardiomyopathy,
16   guideline-proposed multimodality imaging protocol should be applied. If SHD is confirmed,
17   disease-specific therapy, if available, should be initiatied in addition to device implantation. A
18   description of findings that may complicate device implantation should be included in the cardiac
19   imaging reports. CRT - cardiac resynchronization therapy (-P without defibrillator, -D with
20   defibrillator), LVEF – left ventricular ejection fraction.

20   While both diseases belong to the spectrum of hypertrophic phenotype (top panels), the pattern
21   of LV longitudinal strain impairment can be strikingly different (bottom panels). In patients with

 5   Electrical atrioventricular and ventricular conduction delays are visible as prolonged PQ interval or
 6   abnormal QRS morphology and width on ECG and result in different mechanical phenomena. Left:
 7   prolonged atrioventricular conduction may result in a fusion of E and A waves and a reduced left
 8   ventricular filling time (LVFT) on transmitral pulsed-wave Doppler measurements. Middle: left
 9   bundle branch block causes interventricular dyssynchrony that can be assessed as time delay
10   between the onset of right and LV ejection on pulsed wave Doppler recordings of right and LV
11   outflow tracts. Right: prolonged intraventricular conduction can be also reflected by mechanical
12   events in the LV which can be assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography (here septal and
13   lateral strain curves are shown). ECG – electrocardiogram; LV – left ventricle.

16   (LBBB) on B-mode, M-mode and strain echocardiography.

18   An early electrical activation of the septum results in a short initial septal contraction and causes
19   the apex to move septally, while the septum moves leftward (yellow arrow in B -mode, red arrow
20   in M-mode, red strain curve). The delayed activation of the lateral wall pulls then the apex laterally
21   during the ejection phase while stretching the septum (red arrow in B-mode, black strain curve).
22   This typical sequence of the septal-to-lateral apex motion is described as ‘apical rocking’. The
23   septal inward motion is described as ‘septal flash’.

7    The LV is divided in 36 segments which are shown by the wireframe. The small sphere at the basal
8    ring of the wireframe indicates the anterior hinge point of the RV. The colors represent the latest
9    mechanical activation of the lateral wall, which in this case is 269 ms. The lateral branch of the
10   posterior vein (PVL) lies amidst the target area. GCV - great cardiac vein; PV - posterior vein; PVI -
