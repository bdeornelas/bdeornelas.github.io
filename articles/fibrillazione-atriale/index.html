          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What is atrial fibrillation?</h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Atrial fibrillation is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, also called "A-fib." In people with atrial fibrillation, the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. Instead of contracting normally, the upper chambers quiver or fibrillate.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Normally, the heart beats in a steady rhythm controlled by electrical signals. In atrial fibrillation, abnormal electrical signals cause the upper chambers (atria) to contract very rapidly and irregularly, typically 300 to 600 times per minute.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Atrial fibrillation affects about 2 to 3 percent of people in developed countries. It becomes much more common with age. About 10 percent of people over 80 have atrial fibrillation. Over a lifetime, about 1 in 3 people will develop this condition.

          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Some people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms. The condition is discovered during a routine exam or test. About 1 in 3 people with atrial fibrillation do not have symptoms.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            When symptoms occur, they can include:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-3 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●Palpitations (feeling that the heart is racing, beating irregularly, or "skipping beats")</li>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Why is atrial fibrillation serious?</h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Atrial fibrillation is serious mainly because it increases the risk of stroke. When the upper chambers of the heart quiver instead of contracting normally, blood can pool and form clots, especially in a small pouch called the left atrial appendage. If a clot breaks loose and travels to the brain, it causes a stroke.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            People with atrial fibrillation have about a 5 times higher risk of stroke compared with people who do not have the condition. The good news is that medicines called anticoagulants (blood thinners) can greatly reduce this risk.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The risk of stroke depends on other factors besides atrial fibrillation, including:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●Older age</li>
            <li>●High blood pressure</li>
            <li>●Diabetes</li>
            <li>●Previous stroke or heart problems</li>
            <li>●Blood vessel disease</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Your doctor will assess your individual risk to decide if you need anticoagulants. Other problems related to atrial fibrillation can include:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5">
            <li>●Heart failure, if the heart beats fast for a long time and weakens</li>
            <li>●Reduced quality of life due to symptoms</li>
            <li>●Anxiety about the irregular heartbeat</li>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed?</h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Atrial fibrillation is diagnosed with an electrocardiogram, or "ECG" (a test that records the electrical activity of the heart). Because the abnormal rhythm sometimes comes and goes, you might need a longer recording.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Tests that can help diagnose atrial fibrillation include:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-3 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Electrocardiogram (ECG)</strong> – This is the main test. If the abnormal rhythm is present during the recording, the diagnosis is immediate. The test takes only a few minutes.</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Holter monitor</strong> – A small device you wear at home for 24 to 48 hours. It is useful if the abnormal rhythm comes and goes.</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Smartwatch or wearable device</strong> – Modern devices like Apple Watch or Samsung watches can detect the irregular rhythm. These are useful, but the diagnosis must always be confirmed with a standard ECG.</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart)</strong> – This test shows how well the heart is pumping and if there are other heart problems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Your doctor will also order blood tests to:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5">
            <li>●Check thyroid function (thyroid problems can cause atrial fibrillation)</li>
            <li>●Check kidney function (important for choosing the right anticoagulant)</li>
            <li>●Measure electrolytes like potassium and magnesium</li>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">How is atrial fibrillation treated?</h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Treatment for atrial fibrillation has two main goals: preventing stroke and controlling symptoms. The most important treatment is preventing stroke with anticoagulants (blood thinners). Your doctor will also decide whether treatment is needed to control your heart rate or rhythm.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What about medicines to prevent stroke?</h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Anticoagulants are also sometimes called "blood thinners." But they do not actually thin the blood. They reduce the blood's ability to clot, which helps prevent strokes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Not all people with atrial fibrillation need anticoagulants. Your doctor will assess your stroke risk based on factors like age, high blood pressure, diabetes, previous stroke, and heart problems. If your risk is high, the benefits of anticoagulants greatly outweigh the bleeding risks. Studies show these medicines reduce stroke risk by more than 80 percent.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The main anticoagulants used today include:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-3 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Apixaban (brand name: Eliquis)</strong></li>

            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Dabigatran (brand name: Pradaxa)</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            These newer anticoagulants are the preferred treatment for most people. They have several advantages:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●No need for regular blood tests to check dosing</li>
            <li>●More predictable effect</li>
            <li>●Fewer interactions with foods and other medicines</li>
            <li>●Very effective at preventing stroke</li>
            <li>●Lower risk of bleeding in the brain compared with warfarin</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong class="text-white">Warfarin (brand name: Jantoven, also called Coumadin in some places)</strong> – This is the older anticoagulant. It is still used in some situations, including:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●People with artificial heart valves</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Warfarin requires frequent blood tests to check that the dosing is correct. It also requires attention to diet, because foods high in vitamin K (like leafy green vegetables) can affect how the medicine works.

            <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5">
              <li>●Never stop taking anticoagulants without talking to your doctor. Your stroke risk returns immediately if you stop.</li>
              <li>●Take the medicine exactly as prescribed. Following the schedule and dose is essential.</li>
              <li>●Watch for signs of bleeding. Contact your doctor if you notice blood in your urine, black stools, frequent nosebleeds, or bruising that appears easily.</li>
              <li>●Tell all doctors and dentists that you take anticoagulants.</li>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What about medicines to control heart rate or rhythm?</h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Besides preventing stroke, your doctor might treat the abnormal rhythm itself to improve symptoms. There are two main approaches: slowing the heart rate (even though it stays irregular) or trying to restore normal rhythm.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong class="text-white">Rate control</strong> – If your heart beats too fast with atrial fibrillation, your doctor can prescribe medicines to slow it down. This approach accepts the irregular rhythm but keeps it under control. Medicines commonly used include:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Beta blockers</strong> (like metoprolol, carvedilol, or bisoprolol) – These are the first choice for most people</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Calcium channel blockers</strong> (like diltiazem or verapamil) – An alternative to beta blockers in some cases</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Digoxin</strong> – Used less often, mainly in people with heart failure</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For many people, this approach is enough and allows a normal life.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong class="text-white">Rhythm control</strong> – If you have many symptoms or the abnormal rhythm started recently, your doctor might propose restoring normal rhythm. This can be done with:

          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-3 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Electrical cardioversion</strong> – A small electric shock to the heart, given while you are asleep with light anesthesia. It is very effective (works in 9 out of 10 people) and does not hurt because you are asleep. It is done in the hospital and takes only a few minutes.</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Medicine cardioversion</strong> – Medicines given by vein or by mouth that can restore normal rhythm. They work in about half of cases, especially if the abnormal rhythm started recently.</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Medicines to maintain normal rhythm</strong> – After restoring normal rhythm, your doctor might prescribe antiarrhythmic medicines to take daily to prevent the abnormal rhythm from returning. The main ones include:
              <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-1 ml-5 mt-2">
                <li>– Flecainide or propafenone (used if the heart is structurally normal)</li>

              If atrial fibrillation has been present for more than 2 days, there is a risk that clots have formed in the heart. For this reason:

              <li>●You will need to take anticoagulants for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion</li>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What is catheter ablation?</h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Catheter ablation is a procedure that can permanently correct atrial fibrillation in many people. It is especially effective in forms that come and go (paroxysmal) and in younger people.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            During ablation, the cardiologist inserts thin tubes (catheters) through a vein in the groin and guides them to the heart. Using heat or cold, the doctor destroys the areas of the heart causing the abnormal rhythm, particularly where the pulmonary veins connect to the left atrium.
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●Done under general anesthesia or deep sedation, so you will not feel pain</li>
            <li>●Takes about 2 to 4 hours</li>
            <li>●Requires 1 to 2 days in the hospital</li>
            <li>●Recovery is fairly quick; most people return to normal activities in 1 to 2 weeks</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Ablation is particularly recommended for:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●Young or middle-aged people with atrial fibrillation that comes and goes</li>
            <li>●People with many symptoms despite medicines</li>
            <li>●People who prefer a long-term solution instead of taking medicines forever</li>
            <li>●People with heart failure caused or worsened by the abnormal rhythm</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The success rate is good: in about 7 to 8 out of 10 people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the abnormal rhythm does not return after a single procedure. Sometimes a second ablation is needed for lasting results.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Like all medical procedures, ablation carries some risks, although they are rare in experienced centers:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●Bleeding or bruising at the catheter entry site</li>
            <li>●Fluid collection around the heart (requires drainage)</li>
            <li>●Stroke or blood vessel problems (very rare)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Your cardiologist will explain the specific risks and benefits for your case.

          <div class="info-step rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-white mb-3">After ablation</h3>
            <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5">
              <li>●<strong class="text-white">First 3 months</strong> – A "settling" period. The abnormal rhythm can return temporarily; this does not mean the procedure failed.</li>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">What lifestyle changes can help?</h2>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Even if you already have atrial fibrillation, lifestyle changes can greatly reduce recurrences, improve treatment effectiveness, and make you feel better. If you do not have it yet, these steps can help prevent it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The most important factors to control include:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-3 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Blood pressure</strong> – Keeping blood pressure under control (target below 130/80 mmHg) is essential. High blood pressure is one of the main factors that cause and worsen atrial fibrillation.</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Body weight</strong> – Losing 10 percent of your weight if you are overweight can cut the recurrence rate in half. This is one of the most effective changes.</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Alcohol</strong> – Reducing or completely eliminating alcohol greatly reduces recurrences. Even moderate amounts (1 to 2 drinks per day) can trigger the abnormal rhythm. Binge drinking (drinking a lot on one occasion) is especially dangerous.</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Sleep apnea</strong> – If you snore heavily and feel tired during the day, you might have sleep apnea. Treating it with CPAP (a mask worn at night) reduces recurrences by almost half.</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Diabetes</strong> – Keep blood sugar well controlled if you have diabetes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Some factors can trigger atrial fibrillation. The most common include:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Alcohol</strong> – Even a single night of heavy drinking can trigger an episode</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Too little sleep</strong> – Sleeping less than 6 hours per night increases risk</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Severe stress</strong> – Situations of intense emotional stress</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Excess caffeine</strong> – More than 4 to 5 cups of coffee per day in sensitive people (1 to 3 cups are fine for most people)</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Energy drinks</strong> – Can trigger abnormal rhythms</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Dehydration</strong> – Drinking too little water, especially in summer</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong class="text-white">Physical activity</strong> – Regular moderate exercise is good and reduces the risk of abnormal rhythms. The ideal is:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5">
            <li>●Walking briskly, cycling, or swimming 30 minutes per day for 5 days per week</li>
            <li>●Avoid extreme endurance sports (marathons, triathlons, ultra-cycling); very intense exercise for many hours increases the risk of atrial fibrillation</li>
            <li>●If you do competitive sports, talk with your cardiologist for a personalized assessment</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If you have atrial fibrillation, regular follow-up with your doctor is important:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Visits</strong> – Every 6 months if you are stable, more often if there are changes</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">Blood tests</strong> – At least once a year to check kidney function, thyroid, and other parameters</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">ECG and echocardiogram</strong> – Periodically to see how the heart is doing</li>
            <li>●<strong class="text-white">If taking warfarin</strong> – Monthly blood tests to check INR</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Learning to feel your pulse can help you know if the abnormal rhythm is present:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●Place two fingers (index and middle) on your wrist or neck</li>
            <li>●With atrial fibrillation, the beat will be completely irregular, without a rhythm</li>
            <li>●If you notice the abnormal rhythm returning, inform your doctor</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            You can travel safely, even by plane. Some tips:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 ml-5 mb-6">
            <li>●Always carry medicines in carry-on luggage</li>
            <li>●Bring extra medicines in case of delays</li>
            <li>●Drink water regularly during the flight</li>
            <li>●Get up and walk every 2 hours on long flights</li>
            <li>●Carry a letter from your doctor explaining your condition and medicines</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Many people with atrial fibrillation live normal, active lives. Modern treatments are very effective at preventing stroke and controlling symptoms. The most important things are to take prescribed medicines regularly (especially anticoagulants), get regular check-ups, and follow a healthy lifestyle. With proper management, atrial fibrillation is a condition that can be controlled very well.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <div class="info-step rounded-lg p-6 mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-white mb-2">Will I need to take anticoagulants forever?</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
              It depends on your stroke risk. If you have risk factors like older age, high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems, anticoagulants should be taken indefinitely, even if the abnormal rhythm seems gone. The stroke risk persists because the abnormal rhythm can return without you noticing it. Your doctor will assess your specific case.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-step rounded-lg p-6 mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-white mb-2">If I have ablation and it works, can I stop anticoagulants?</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
              Usually no. Even after successful ablation, the abnormal rhythm can return silently (without symptoms), so the stroke risk remains. For this reason, if you have risk factors, anticoagulants should be continued. Only in very selected cases and after prolonged monitoring can you discuss with your doctor the possibility of stopping them.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-step rounded-lg p-6 mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-white mb-2">Can I drink coffee?</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
              Yes, moderate coffee consumption (1 to 3 cups per day) is fine for most people with atrial fibrillation and does not increase the risk of abnormal rhythms. Avoid only excessive amounts (more than 4 to 5 cups per day) or if you notice that coffee triggers your symptoms.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-step rounded-lg p-6 mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-white mb-2">Are smartwatches reliable for monitoring the abnormal rhythm?</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
              Modern smartwatches (Apple Watch, Samsung, Fitbit) are fairly reliable at detecting atrial fibrillation and can be useful for monitoring if the abnormal rhythm returns. However, they do not replace medical diagnosis: if a smartwatch detects an abnormal rhythm, it must always be confirmed with a standard ECG by a doctor. They can also give false alarms, so do not be overly alarmed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-step rounded-lg p-6 mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-white mb-2">If I have no symptoms, do I still need treatment?</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
              Absolutely yes. Even without symptoms, the stroke risk is the same. Anticoagulants should be taken if indicated, regardless of symptoms. As for controlling heart rate or rhythm, if you have no symptoms and the heart is not beating too fast, specific treatment beyond anticoagulants might not be needed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-step rounded-lg p-6 mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-white mb-2">Can I exercise?</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
              Yes, moderate physical activity is recommended and is good for you. Walking, swimming, cycling, and exercise classes are all safe activities. Avoid only extreme endurance sports (marathons, triathlons), and if you take anticoagulants, be careful with contact sports because of trauma risk. Talk with your cardiologist for personalized advice.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-step rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-white mb-2">What foods should I avoid?</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
              If you take newer oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, dabigatran), there are no special food restrictions. If you take warfarin, be careful with leafy green vegetables high in vitamin K (spinach, kale, broccoli): you do not need to eliminate them, but eat them in consistent amounts. Reduce or eliminate alcohol because it can trigger the abnormal rhythm.
