Heart failure (HF) is a major disease in our society that often presents with multiple comorbidities with mutual interaction and aggravation.
The comorbidity of HF and stroke is a high risk condition that requires particular attention to ensure early detection of complications,
efficient diagnostic workup, close monitoring, and consequent treatment of the patient. The bi-directional interaction between the heart
and the brain is inherent in the pathophysiology of HF where HF may be causal for acute cerebral injury, and – in turn – acute cerebral
injury may induce or aggravate HF via imbalanced neural and neurovegetative control of cardiovascular regulation. The present document
represents the consensus view of the ESC Council on Stroke, the Heart Failure Association and the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis
to summarize current insights on pathophysiological interactions of the heart and the brain in the comorbidity of HF and stroke. Principal
aspects of diagnostic workup, pathophysiological mechanisms, complications, clinical management in acute conditions and in long-term
care of patients with the comorbidity are presented and state-of-the-art clinical management and current evidence from clinical trials is
discussed. Beside the physicians perspective, also the patients values and preferences are taken into account. Interdisciplinary cooperation
of cardiologists, stroke specialists, other specialists and primary care physicians is pivotal to ensure optimal treatment in acute events and
in continued long-term treatment of these patients. Key consensus statements are presented in a concise overview on mechanistic insights,
diagnostic workup, prevention and treatment to inform clinical acute and continued care of patients with the comorbidity of HF and stroke.
