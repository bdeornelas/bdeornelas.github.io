In this EACVI clinical scientific update, we will explore the current use of multi-modality imaging in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and follow-up of
patients with aortic stenosis, with a particular focus on recent developments and future directions. Echocardiography is and will likely remain the key
method of diagnosis and surveillance of aortic stenosis providing detailed assessments of valve haemodynamics and the cardiac remodelling response.
Computed tomography (CT) is already widely used in the planning of transcutaneous aortic valve implantation. We anticipate its increased use as an
anatomical adjudicator to clarify disease severity in patients with discordant echocardiographic measurements. CT calcium scoring is currently used
for this purpose; however, contrast CT techniques are emerging that allow identification of both calcific and fibrotic valve thickening. Additionally,
improved assessments of myocardial decompensation with echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and CT will become more commonplace
in our routine assessment of aortic stenosis. Underpinning all of this will be widespread application of artificial intelligence. In combination, we believe
this new era of multi-modality imaging in aortic stenosis will improve the diagnosis, follow-up, and timing of intervention in aortic stenosis as well as
potentially accelerate the development of the novel pharmacological treatments required for this disease.
