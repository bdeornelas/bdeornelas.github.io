Right-sided heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation are common and strongly associated with poor quality of life and an increased risk of heart
failure hospitalizations and death. While medical therapy for right-sided heart failure is limited, treatment options for tricuspid regurgitation
include surgery and, based on recent developments, several transcatheter interventions. However, the patients who might benefit from
tricuspid valve interventions are yet unknown, as is the ideal time for these treatments given the paucity of clinical evidence. In this context,
it is crucial to elucidate aetiology and pathophysiological mechanisms leading to right-sided heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation in order
to recognize when tricuspid regurgitation is a mere bystander and when it can cause or contribute to heart failure progression. Notably,
early identification of right heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation may be crucial and optimal management requires knowledge about the
different mechanisms and causes, clinical course and presentation, as well as possible treatment options. The aim of this clinical consensus
statement is to summarize current knowledge about epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment of tricuspid regurgitation in right-sided
heart failure providing practical suggestions for patient identification and management.
