1. Preamble
Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of assisting health professionals in proposing the best management strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines and their recommendations should facilitate decision making of health professionals in their daily practice. However, guidelines are not a substitute for the patient’s relationship with their practitioner. The ﬁnal decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s), based on what they consider to be the most appropriate in the circumstances. These decisions are made in consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate.
Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals. To ensure that all users have access to the most recent recommendations, the
ESC makes its Guidelines freely available. The ESC warns readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by the
ESC. Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website (https://www.
escardio.org/Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the ofﬁcial position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.


<!-- PAGE 9 -->

### Page 9

In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the ESC
carries out the EURObservational Research Programme of international registries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions, which are essential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources and adherence to guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world,
based on high-quality data collected during routine clinical practice.
Furthermore, the ESC develops sets of quality indicators (QIs),
which are tools to evaluate the level of implementation of the guidelines and may be used by the ESC, hospitals, healthcare providers and professionals to measure clinical practice, and in educational programmes, alongside the key messages from the guidelines, to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes.
The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology. The selection procedure aimed to ensure that there is a representative mix of members predominantly from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty Communities.
Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion, notably with respect to gender and country of origin. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the risk–beneﬁt ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and scored according to predeﬁned scales, as outlined below. The Task Force followed the ESC voting procedures. All recommendations subject to a vote achieved at least 75% among voting members.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of conﬂicts of interest. Their declarations of interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/
Guidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a supplementary document simultaneously to the guidelines.
This process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of interest that arise during the writing period were notiﬁed to the

ESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire ﬁnancial support from the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the approval process of these guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive review by the CPG and external experts, including a mix of members from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant
ESC Subspecialty Communities and National Cardiac Societies. After appropriate revisions, the guidelines are signed off by all the experts involved in the Task Force. The ﬁnalized document is signed off by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The guidelines were developed after careful consideration of the scientiﬁc and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their writing.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations, including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary slides,
summary cards for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus,
for more detailed information, the user should always access the fulltext version of the guidelines, which is freely available via the ESC website and the European Heart Journal. The National Cardiac Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, adopt, translate and implement all
ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably inﬂuenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC
Guidelines do not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription and to respect the ethical rules of their profession.
Off-label use of medication may be presented in this guideline if sufﬁcient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically appropriate to a given condition and if patients could beneﬁt from the recommended therapy. However, the ﬁnal decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional giving special consideration to:
(1) the speciﬁc situation of the patient. In this respect, it is speciﬁed that, unless otherwise provided for by national regulations, offlabel use of medication should be limited to situations where it is in the patient’s interest to do so, with regard to the quality,
safety and efﬁcacy of care, and only after the patient has been informed and has provided consent;
(2) country-speciﬁc health regulations, indications by governmental drug regulatory agencies and the ethical rules to which health professionals are subject, where applicable.
2. Introduction
This is the ﬁrst European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline on cardio-oncology. The aim of this guideline is to help all the healthcare professionals providing care to oncology patients before, during, and after their cancer treatments with respect to their cardiovascular (CV)
health and wellness. This guideline provides guidance on the deﬁnitions,
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer therapy-related CV
toxicity (CTR-CVT), and the management of CV disease (CVD)
caused directly or indirectly by cancer. This area of medicine has limited trials and evidence on which to base decision-making and,
where evidence is limited, this guideline provides the consensus of expert opinion to guide healthcare professionals.
This guideline includes the deﬁnitions of CTR-CVT (Section 3),1 and provides a personalized approach to care based upon the baseline
CV toxicity risk assessment (Section 4) and new protocols for CV surveillance during cancer treatment (Section 5). The management of acute
CTR-CVT is addressed in Section 6, where patients with activecancer are those receiving anticancer treatment. Throughout these sections,
decision-making depends upon the risk/beneﬁt balance of oncology treatment efﬁcacy and the severity and impact of CTR-CVT. Guidance is provided for the ﬁrst 12 months after completion of cardiotoxic treatments (Section 7), when subacute CVD can emerge, and when patients who developed CTR-CVT during cancer treatment are reviewed.
Diagnosis and management of the long-term CV complications of previous oncology treatments, beyond 12 months after completing the cardiotoxic treatments, and integration into the overall survivorship strategy for cancer survivors (CS) is presented in Section 8 with new long-term surveillance recommendations for high-risk patients.
In Section 9, we address special populations where CVDs are directly caused by the cancer, or where special considerations are required. Section 10 provides information for patients’ involvement in their own care. The ﬁnal section highlights the role of the ESC and the ESC Council of Cardio-Oncology (ESC-CCO).
CTR-CVT risk is a dynamic variable, and the risk changes throughout the pathway of care (Figure 1, Video 1). Absolute risk of
CTR-CVT is important to understand and balance against the absolute beneﬁt of the cancer treatment before and during treatment.
However, CTR-CVT risk can be inﬂuenced by several variables, including implementation of primary prevention treatments, optimization of pre-existing CVD, dose, frequency, and duration of oncology treatment, emergence of CV complications during treatment and their severity, and in CS, the overall cumulative treatment received,
the time since treatment, and the interaction with other CVDs.
2.1. Cancer and cardiovascular needs of patients with cancer
Since the 1990s, there has been a steady decline in cancer-related mortality mirrored by a steady increase in CS.2,3 In this context,
treatment-related side effects have gained more signiﬁcance.
Management of CTR-CVT has a tremendous impact on the type of anticancer therapies that patients can receive as well as the long-term morbidity and mortality outcomes of patients with cancer. Effective management of patients with both cancer and CVD requires the unique interest and expertise of healthcare providers, which has led to the formation of a new discipline: cardio-oncology.4,5 A recently published ESC-CCO document describes appropriate criteria for the organization and implementation of cardio-oncology services.5
2.2. Role of cardio-oncology services
The overarching goal of the cardio-oncology discipline is to allow patients with cancer to receive the best possible cancer treatments safely,

minimizing CTR-CVT across the entire continuum of cancer care.5
Before initiation of cancer therapies with a known CV toxicity proﬁle,
the cardio-oncology team should identify and treat CV risk factors
(CVRF) and pre-existing CVDs and deﬁne an appropriate prevention and surveillance plan for early identiﬁcation and appropriate management of potential CV complications (Figure 2). Another important aspect is the participation in interdisciplinary discussions regarding the beneﬁts and risks of certain cancer treatments and their continuation or interruption should side effects become apparent. After cancer treatment has been completed, the focus shifts to co-ordination of long-term follow-up and treatment. For patients on long-term cancer therapies with CV toxicity risk, surveillance should continue until the treatment is ﬁnished.6–8 There is also the need for re-assessment of
CV risks in patients requiring treatment for secondary malignancies.
2.3. General principles of cardio-oncology
A guiding principle of cardio-oncology is the integration of clinical disciplines. Cardio-oncology providers must have knowledge of the broad scope of cardiology, oncology, and haematology management.5
Recommendations are formed regarding the most permissible (from a

CS, cancer survivors; CTR-CVT, cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity; CV, cardiovascular; CVD, cardiovascular disease; CVRF, cardiovascular risk factors; CTR-CVT risk is a dynamic variable that changes through the pathway of care, and is inﬂuenced by several conditions including age, cancer history, pre-existing CVRF or CVD, and previous cardiotoxic cancer therapy. The CTR-CVT risk changes during and after treatment according to type, dose, frequency, and duration of oncology treatment (blue solid line). Pre-existing CVRF, CVD, or previous cancer treatments may increase the magnitude of acute and long-term CV toxicity risk (purple solid line). CTR-CVT risk remains variable in extent during anticancer treatment and may or may not gradually increase over time (dotted lines). Cardio-oncology strategy may reduce the magnitude of CTR-CVT by: (1) optimizing CVD
and CVRF management (green arrows); (2) considering cardioprotective strategies in high-risk patients (green arrows); (3) organizing cancer treatment surveillance; and (4) introducing early cardioprotection after the detection of subclinical CTR-CVT (purple arrows). CV risk assessment within the ﬁrst year after completion of cardiotoxic cancer therapy identiﬁes CS who require long-term follow-up. Cancer survivorship programmes that include annual CV risk assessment and CVRF/CVD management are recommended to minimize long-term CV adverse events (brown arrows).

Adjudication of CV events occurring in patients on active therapy is another important aspect of cardio-oncology practice.1,3 This is in addition to recommendations on best treatment and management practices. This includes the full scope of CV therapies, including healthy lifestyle promotion and pharmacological, device, and surgical treatments.4,9,10
The principle underlying the dynamic course of CTR-CVT development in patients with cancer is that the absolute risk depends on their baseline risk and changes with exposure to cardiotoxic therapies over

time (Figure 3).11 This has been recognized in conceptual models, with risk stratiﬁcation tools designed to grade patients with cancer into low, moderate, high, and very high risk of CV complications prior to starting treatment. These have been published by the Heart Failure
Association (HFA) of the ESC in collaboration with the International
Cardio-Oncology Society (ICOS) (see Section 4).12,13 Severity, duration, and type of manifestation of CTR-CVT vary by type of malignancy and cancer treatment. The risk itself can be understood in two ways: (1) the likelihood of its occurrence and (2) the severity of the complication (Figure 4). For example, a patient could be very likely to experience a CTR-CVT, but if this event is mild, oncology treatment should continue. Conversely, a patient at low likelihood could still be at high risk according to the severity of the event, which would lead to interruption of cancer treatment, e.g. a signiﬁcant decline in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) to , 40% with anthracycline chemotherapy. The timeline of these developments may also be rather different. After the cardiotoxic cancer treatment has been completed, a new risk assessment is recommended to establish different long-term trajectories of CV health. These trajectories are impacted by the permanent CV toxic effects and cardiac or vascular injury of some cancer therapies, patient-related CVRF, environmental factors, and stressors (e.g. acute viral infections). The aim should be to personalize approaches to minimize CTR-CVT and improve both cancer and CV outcomes.

### 3 Cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity deﬁnitions

Several terminologies and deﬁnitions have previously been proposed to describe the spectrum of CTR-CVT, leading to inconsistencies in diagnosis and management. The need to harmonize these deﬁnitions has frequently been stated and recognized, and resulted in the recent international deﬁnitions of CTR-CVT1 supported by this guideline
(Table 3; Supplementary data, Table S1). This document will focus on consensus deﬁnitions for cardiomyopathy and heart failure
(HF), myocarditis, vascular toxicities, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation. The deﬁnitions of other CTR-CVT, including pericardial and valvular heart diseases
(VHDs), are the same as those used for the general cardiology population. For cardiac injury, cardiomyopathy, and HF, the descriptive term cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is recommended as it captures the broad spectrum of possible presentations and the aetiological link with the broad scope of various cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted agents, immune therapies,
and radiation therapy.

The ultimate risk is the combination of the likelihood (based on reported incidence) and degree (severity or grade) of the adverse event. The most vulnerable patient groups are those at high likelihood of experiencing a severe adverse event. The level of attention that needs to be devoted to these patients varies accordingly. The risk and type of CTR-CVT, as well as the potential for reversibility, depends on different factors, listed in
Figure 3, that should be considered to deﬁne global CV and oncological prognosis and to individualize CTR-CVT surveillance. Additional factors that add to the complexity of CTR-CVT risk assessment are the cancer type and prognosis, and type, duration, and intensity of cancer treatment.

### 4 Cardiovascular toxicity risk stratiﬁcation before anticancer therapy

The optimal time to consider CVD prevention strategies in patients with cancer is at the time of cancer diagnosis and prior to the initiation of cancer treatment.4,5 This enables the oncology team to consider CV risk while making cancer treatment choices, educating patients regarding their CV risk, personalizing CV surveillance and follow-up strategies, and making appropriate referrals of high-risk patients to cardio-oncology services. These strategies are needed to mitigate CVD risk, and improve the adherence to effective cancer treatments and the overall survival.
CVD prevention strategies require a personalized approach. Risk assessment is a challenging task and it is vital that clinicians adopt a systematic approach without delaying oncological treatment.12,21,22
Figure 5 provides a comprehensive approach to risk assessment.
The choice of the cardiac tests (electrocardiogram [ECG], biomarkers, and imaging) should be individualized based on CV risk and the planned cancer treatments.
4.1. General approach to cardiovascular toxicity risk in patients with cancer

Only a limited number of retrospective risk scores have been published in patients with cancer. Most of these scores have been developed for speciﬁc cancer-patient groups and cannot be readily applied or extrapolated to other type of malignancies.24–29 While further validation is needed, HFA-ICOS risk assessment tools should be considered to determine pre-treatment risk of CTR-CVT as they are easy to use and implement in oncology and haematology services

aData for idarubicin are based upon an estimated anticancer efﬁcacy ratio, not derived from cardiotoxicity data. The CV toxicity dose ratio provides the value that should be used to multiply the dose of the anthracycline of interest to convert to isoequivalent doses of doxorubicin; e.g. to convert 125 mg/m2 of epirubicin to doxorubicin isoequivalent, multiply the dose by 0.8 (125 mg/m2 × 0.8 = 100 mg/m2 of doxorubicin).

anthracycline chemotherapy, the total planned cumulative anthracycline dose is also relevant, and ≥250 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or equivalent should be considered higher risk (Table 5).32
CV risk stratiﬁcation results should be discussed with the patient and documented in clinical notes. This process will also enable future validation of these tools.
Cardiology referral (cardio-oncology programme or cardiologist with expertise in managing CVD in patients with cancer) is recommended for patients identiﬁed to be at high or very high risk for CTR-CVT at baseline (Table 4) to institute strategies to mitigate risk.33 Patients at moderate risk can beneﬁt from closer cardiac monitoring, strict management of traditional CVRF, and selected moderate-risk patients may also beneﬁt from a cardio-oncology referral (Figure 6). Low-risk patients can be followed within the oncology programme with appropriate referral to cardio-oncology if a
CTR-CVT emerges or new or uncontrolled CVRF appear.

4.2. History and clinical examination
A careful clinical history and physical examination is recommended as part of the baseline risk assessment. Oncology patients can be divided into two cohorts with respect to the presence or absence of pre-existing CVD. A primary prevention strategy can be considered in patients without previous CVD or CTR-CVT while secondary prevention includes interventions in patients with prior or active
CVD or previous CTR-CVT.12
Reviewing traditional risk factors for CVD is recommended.
Where present, the efﬁcacy of treatment and control of these modiﬁable risk factors should be determined to ensure optimal control during cancer therapy.4,34
Although recent
SCORE2
and
SCORE2-OP19 tables are not focused on patients with cancer, risk calculation is recommended for patients with cancer .40 years of age (unless they are automatically categorized as being at high risk or very high risk based on documented CVD, diabetes mellitus
[DM], kidney disease, or a highly elevated single risk factor) as a reference to optimize CVRF treatment goals.19,31,35 A family history of premature CVD should be considered because genetic abnormalities associated with CVD may predispose patients with cancer to a higher risk of CTR-CVT.36–38 Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle, exposure to pollution, and frailty are important shared risk factors for both cancer and CVD.
Information on prior history of cancer, cardiotoxic cancer therapies,
and their respective doses should be collected. Patients should be asked about typical cardiac symptoms (e.g. chest pain with activity,
dyspnoea on exertion, orthopnoea, palpitations, and peripheral oedema), which can guide clinical examination and investigations.
Physical examination should document vital signs and look for potential indicators of undiagnosed CVD such as HF, pericardial disease,
VHD, and arrhythmias.39–42
The second scenario is secondary prevention in patients with a prior history of CVD. These patients with cancer are potentially at high or very high risk of future CV events,12 and require a more comprehensive clinical evaluation of their CVD, its severity, and prior and current treatments. Depending on the type and severity of CVD, additional investigations—including resting or stress echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), nuclear perfusion imaging, and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
—may be indicated to determine risk status. Identifying prior CVD
should not automatically be a reason to withhold cancer therapy but considered an opportunity to optimize CV risk prior to and during treatment. Risk/beneﬁt discussions should include the patient,
oncologist or haematologist, and—where available—a specialized cardio-oncology service.
Additional factors that add to the complexity of baseline CV risk assessment are the cancer type and prognosis, and type, duration,
and intensity of cancer treatment (Figure 1).4,12,43 Clinical history,
physical examination features, and treatment-related risk factors that contribute to CTR-CVT for various cancer therapies are summarized in Supplementary data, Table S8. These risk factors should be collected and considered along with baseline ECG, cardiac serum biomarkers, and cardiac imaging tests (summarized in Figure 7) to complete baseline CTR-CVT evaluation.
4.3. Electrocardiogram
A baseline 12-lead ECG is a readily available test that can provide important clues to underlying CVD. ECG evidence of chamber enlargement, conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias, ischaemia, or prior myocardial infarction (MI), and low voltages should be interpreted in the clinical context. A baseline ECG is recommended prior to starting a cancer treatment known to cause QTc prolongation.44–49
Measurement of QTc using the Fridericia correction (QTcF) is

recommended.44–48 When baseline QTcF prolongation is recognized, the correction of reversible causes and the identiﬁcation of genetic conditions that prolong QT is recommended (see Section
6.4.2).45
Left atrial enlargement on baseline ECG before ibrutinib has been shown to be a predictor for the development of atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) during chemotherapy.50,51 The presence of atrioventricular (AV) conduction delays and premature atrial complexes are associated with the development of atrial arrhythmias in patients undergoing autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).52
4.4. Cardiac serum biomarkers
The literature on the use of biomarkers for CTR-CVT risk stratiﬁcation before cancer therapy is limited, and recommendations are mostly based on expert opinion.12,43,53–55 Four recent position papers based on collaboration among the Cardio-Oncology Study
Group of the HFA of the ESC, the ESC-CCO, and ICOS have suggested that measurement of cardiac serum biomarkers—cardiac troponin (cTn) I or T and natriuretic peptides (NP) (e.g. B-type natriuretic peptide
[BNP]
or
N-terminal pro-BNP
[NT-proBNP])—help in baseline CV risk stratiﬁcation of patients scheduled for cancer therapies including anthracyclines, human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (VEGFi), proteasome inhibitors (PI), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) and tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) therapies, allowing identiﬁcation of those who may beneﬁt from cardioprotective therapy.12,43,53,54 Baseline cardiac serum biomarker measurements are required if the degree of change in the biomarkers is to be used to identify subclinical cardiac injury during cancer treatment.
A few studies of paediatric and adult patients requiring anthracycline chemotherapy have reported that patients with cancer with an increased cTn before treatment were more likely to develop CTRCD.56–58 However, most published studies have not reported on the prognostic value of baseline cTn measurements, possibly due to the low prevalence of patients with previous CVD or CVRF in these studies.55,59,60 A study of 251
women receiving trastuzumab for early HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) reported that 19% of the patients who developed cardiac dysfunction during trastuzumab therapy had positive ultrasensitive troponin I at baseline (.80 ng/L).61 Furthermore,
baseline high cTnI level was a predictor of lack of recovery despite optimal HF therapy.61 These ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed in a subsequent study of 533 patients with BC who had serial high-sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn) I and T measurements during trastuzumab therapy.62
Increased baseline cTn
(.40 ng/L
and
.14 ng/L for hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT, respectively) was associated with a four-fold risk of developing LV dysfunction (LVD).62
However, given the high proportion of patients with previous anthracycline exposure in both studies, these elevated cTn levels are not a true baseline as they reﬂect pre-trastuzumab but postanthracycline chemotherapy.
It is unclear whether pretreatment cTn levels will be predictive of LVD in patients before any treatment, or for those BC patients treated with trastuzumab without prior anthracyclines.
NP are another potential biomarker for CV risk stratiﬁcation.
Several studies have shown the role of NP measurement at baseline or NP changes to predict future CTR-CVT.63–65 In patients with multiple myeloma (MM), pre-treatment NP may be a predictive marker for subsequent CV adverse events. In 109 patients with relapsed MM,
BNP . 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP . 125 pg/mL levels before initiation of carﬁlzomib were associated with an odds ratio of 10.8 for subsequent CV adverse events.66 Therefore, baseline NP measurement is recommended in high- and very high-risk patients and should be considered in low- and moderate-risk patients before PI
treatment.
Baseline elevated values of CV functional peptides (including
NT-proBNP) and hs-cTnT were strongly related to all-cause mortality in 555 patients with different types of tumours, suggesting that the presence of a subclinical myocardial injury might be directly linked to disease progression.67 However, in the CARDIOTOX
(CARDIOvascular TOXicity induced by cancer-related therapies)
registry, in 855 patients treated with a range of oncological treatments, including radiotherapy (RT), both NT-proBNP and cTn elevation at baseline were not associated with the development of severe
CTRCD (LVEF , 40% or clinical HF).68
There has also been interest in other novel biomarkers for
CTR-CVT risk stratiﬁcation before cancer treatment; however,
the literature is limited. Candidates include myeloperoxidase,
C-reactive protein, galectin-3, arginine–nitric oxide metabolites,
growth differentiation factor-15,
placental growth factor,
fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, micro-ribonucleic acids, and immunoglobulin E.60,69–71 Currently, there is no evidence to support routine measurement of these novel biomarkers and more research is required.

4.5. Cardiovascular imaging
CV imaging has an important role in identifying patients with subclinical CVD, determining the degree of pre-existing cardiac comorbidity prior to decisions regarding cancer therapy, and serves as a reference for identiﬁcation of changes during treatment and long-term followup.12,54,72–74 Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the preferred imaging technique for baseline risk stratiﬁcation as it provides quantitative assessment of LV and right ventricular (RV) function, chamber dilation, LV hypertrophy, regional wall motion abnormalities,
diastolic function, VHD, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and pericardial disease, which may inﬂuence the therapeutic decision.22,72
Suggestions for the components of a baseline echocardiography study are provided in Figure 8.
Current deﬁnitions of CTRCD are based on a reduction of LVEF
and/or relative changes in global longitudinal strain (GLS) (Table 3).

volumes.54,75–79 If 3D echocardiography is not feasible (e.g. unavailable or poor tracking), the modiﬁed two-dimensional (2D)
Simpson’s biplane method is recommended.80,81 In patients with inadequate TTE image quality, ultrasound-enhancing contrast agents should be added to improve evaluation of LV function and volumes if two or more LV segments are not well visualized.82 Alternatively, in subjects with poor-quality echocardiography windows, when available, CMR should be considered (Figure 8).14,72,83,84 If TTE and
CMR are both unavailable for the assessment of LVEF, multigated acquisition nuclear imaging (MUGA) can be considered as a third-line modality. MUGA scans should be avoided whenever possible due to radiation exposure and the inability to obtain other important information (e.g. VHD, PAP, or GLS).
Baseline LVEF and GLS are recommended in all patients evaluated with TTE before cardiotoxic cancer treatment initiation to stratify
CTR-CVT risk and to identify signiﬁcant changes during treatment.8,64 Changes in loading conditions occur frequently during chemotherapy (e.g. volume increase due to intravenous [i.v.] ﬂuids,
volume loss due to vomiting or diarrhoea, blood pressure [BP] and heart rate changes with pain or stress) and may affect cardiac volumes, LVEF, and GLS quantiﬁcation. Systemic arterial BP measurement is recommended with all resting TTE as it can inﬂuence cardiac function measurements and should be recorded on the
TTE report. A baseline borderline (50–54%) or reduced (,50%)
LVEF is a risk factor for future CTR-CVT from most cardiotoxic cancer therapies, in particular with anthracyclines or trastuzumab.12,24,74
Increased baseline indexed LV end-diastolic volume can be a predictor of major CV events (symptomatic HF or cardiac death) during anthracycline chemotherapy in patients with preserved LVEF.85
A normal LVEF does not exclude CTRCD and deformation parameters can detect early systolic impairment with sufﬁcient test reliability.86–89 Determination of GLS using speckle tracking is recommended at baseline, using three apical views,90 particularly in moderate- and high-risk patients. Baseline GLS can predict
LVD89–94 in patients receiving anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab.
Strain measurements may be subject to inter-vendor variability95
and serial GLS measurement for each patient is recommended to be performed using the same machine/software. A median GLS
change of 13.6% predicted a future fall in LVEF with a 95% upper limit of GLS reduction of 15%.93 Using the 15% cut-off improves speciﬁcity and is therefore the threshold recommended when monitoring
GLS during cancer therapy. Global circumferential strain96 has been reported to identify patients at risk of CTRCD, but data are currently insufﬁcient to recommend its use routinely. Baseline LV diastolic function may be associated with a small risk of subsequent systolic dysfunction, especially with anthracyclines and trastuzumab, although the evidence is not consistent.97,98 Chest computed tomography (CT) or CMR may be helpful for identifying subclinical CVD
such as coronary calcium or intracardiac masses on readily available routine imaging performed for cancer staging.99
In the secondary prevention setting or patients with symptoms or signs of pre-existing CVD, a careful evaluation should begin with a comprehensive TTE.73 This is both to obtain baseline assessment as in the primary prevention setting and to determine the severity of the underlying CVD. In case of poor-quality or uninterpretable
TTE images, or if a speciﬁc CVD is identiﬁed (e.g. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), CMR should be considered for further risk assessment.
Functional imaging tests for myocardial ischaemia—including stress echocardiography, perfusion CMR, or nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging—should be performed to assess for ischaemia in symptomatic patients (stable angina, limiting dyspnoea) if clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease (CAD) exists, especially prior to use of cancer therapies associated with vascular toxicity (e.g. ﬂuoropyrimidines, VEGFi, breakpoint cluster region–Abelson oncogene locus [BCR-ABL], tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKI]). Alternatively, in patients with low to intermediate pre-test probability of CAD,
CCTA is a robust alternate modality with high sensitivity to rule out obstructive CAD.100,101
4.6. Cardiopulmonary ﬁtness assessment
Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) assesses the integrative capacity of the CV system to transport oxygen and energy substrate to skeletal muscle during exercise,109 described as cardiorespiratory ﬁtness (CRF). CPET can therefore provide a more global assessment of CV health than organ-speciﬁc tools. CPET-derived

CRF—typically measured as the peak rate of oxygen consumption110,111 or metabolic equivalents111,112 during exercise—is one of the most robust predictors of CV health and longevity,113,114
and improves risk classiﬁcation.115–121 Evidence for CPET pretreatment is limited to pre-operative risk stratiﬁcation particularly for patients with lung,122 colon,123 and rectal124 cancers. Whether
CPET performed prior to cardiotoxic cancer therapies is prognostic of future CV events is unknown.
4.7. Cardiovascular risk evaluation before cancer surgery
Cancer surgery remains the primary treatment modality for many cancers. Cardio-oncology teams should be involved in pre-operative
CV risk stratiﬁcation to identify and provide appropriate management and surveillance of the potential risk factors.5
In patients undergoing oncological surgery, peri-operative cardiac complications are determined by patient-related risk factors,
the tumour type, concomitant cancer therapies, and the expected surgical risk. To ensure safe cancer surgery, consultations should be directed at: (1) patients with previous signiﬁcant or symptomatic CVD; (2) patients at high and very high CV toxicity risk, according to baseline HFA-ICOS risk assessment tools,12 when adjuvant (post-surgery) cancer treatment is planned; and (3) patients who have received neoadjuvant (prior to surgery) cancer therapy that is potentially cardiotoxic. Pre-operative clinical evaluation should not delay surgery. Complementary tests required for the patients included in groups 1 and 2 should be guided by general
ESC Guidelines.125 However, in group 3 patients, the preoperative evaluation should be aimed at conﬁrming that no relevant events have occurred during CV monitoring (Section 5).
Table 6 summarizes factors that could inﬂuence peri-operative risk during cancer surgery.
4.8. Genetic testing
Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have resulted in the identiﬁcation of 40 candidate genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with anthracycline-related cardiac dysfunction.37,126–128 It should be noted that with the advent of immunotherapies, germline genes may not be the only genetic predispositions to CTR-CVT. A study of patients with ICI-associated myocarditis identiﬁed that the selective clonal T-cell populations inﬁltrating the myocardium were identical to those present in tumours and skeletal muscle, with ribonucleic acid sequencing studies revealing expression of cardiac-speciﬁc genes in the tumour,129
raising the intriguing possibility that somatic mutations in the tumour itself could contribute to CTR-CVT. A list of genetic variants associated with
CVD
during cancer therapy is provided
(Supplementary data, Table S9) and has recently been reviewed.38
Routine use of genetic testing for the assessment of CTR-CVT risk prior to initiation of cancer therapy is not currently recommended.
In the future, a personalized genetic approach may help deﬁne individual susceptibility to CVD in patients with cancer and more research is required.
5. Prevention and monitoring of cardiovascular complications during cancer therapy
5.1. General principles
CTR-CVT risk may vary according to cancer type and stage, anticancer drugs, doses, and underlying comorbidities. Certain therapy combinations (drug–drug or drug–radiation) may have a synergistically toxic effect on the heart, possibly depending on the timing of these therapies (sequential or concomitant) and previous comorbidities. The pathophysiology of CTR-CVT is out of the scope of this guideline and is extensively reviewed in the
ESC
CardioMed textbook.130
CVD and cancer share common modiﬁable and non-modiﬁable risk factors (Figure 3).4,131,132 The ﬁrst step is to optimize lifestyle
CVRF, smoking cessation, restricting alcohol consumption to a maximum of 100 g per week, and maintaining adequate physical activity.30 Exercise prescription seems to be a promising treatment to

counteract anticancer treatment side effects and different types of training can be prescribed during cancer therapy according to a patient’s individual characteristics.133 A healthy lifestyle decreases the risks of cancer, CVD, and transition from diagnosed cancer to subsequent CVD.134,135
Poor CRF is associated with a higher prevalence of acute and chronic CTR-CVT and exercise positively impacts CRF during chemotherapy, although in a recent meta-analysis, the ability of exercise to prevent CTRCD is unclear.136,137 CVRF must be corrected with intensive treatment of arterial hypertension,138 DM,139 and

dyslipidaemia,140 and underlying CVD and modiﬁable comorbidities should be managed according to appropriate 2021 ESC Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice (Figure 9).19
Special attention should also be paid to the polypharmacy frequently seen in patients with cancer, reducing the use of drugs that may interfere with cancer therapies to the essential and actively monitoring their CV side effects and drug–drug interactions.141
Electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia should be corrected. The CV risk management plan should be shared with the cancer specialist team, the primary care physician, and the patient to coordinate treatment strategies.
5.2. Primary prevention strategies
Primary prevention of CTR-CVT aims to avoid or minimize the development of CV damage due to therapy in patients without
CVD12,142 and requires a multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion between oncologists and cardiologists for complex patients with cancer with multiple comorbidities.4,21,22,43,143,144
5.2.1. Primary prevention of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity during anthracycline chemotherapy
Neurohormonal therapies during anthracycline chemotherapy (with or without subsequent trastuzumab treatment) reduced the risk of signiﬁcant LVEF decline during follow-up in several small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (Supplementary data, Table S10).145–154
Recent meta-analyses including patients with cancer treated with anthracycline chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapies reported that renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers,
and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in preventing LVEF reduction, but no statistical differences in the incidence of overt HF or other clinical outcomes were demonstrated
(Supplementary data, Table S11).155–160 This may be due, in part, to the fact that most trials included patients with a low baseline CTRCD
risk and therefore larger RCTs are needed in high-risk populations.
From the oncological perspective, some strategies that have been investigated include managing anthracycline-related toxicity by adjusting the infusion time and dose intensity.161 Dexrazoxane and liposomal anthracyclines are currently approved in patients with high and very high CTRCD risk or who have already received high cumulative anthracyclines doses.158,162–167 Dexrazoxane is protective against anthracycline-induced CTRCD. Currently, dexrazoxane is formally approved in adult patients with advanced or metastatic BC who have already received a minimum cumulative anthracycline dose of
300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or equivalent (Table 5; Supplementary data, Table S12).163 In clinical practice, dexrazoxane infusion (dosage ratio dexrazoxane/doxorubicin is 10/1; e.g. 500 mg/m2 dexrazoxane per 50 mg/m2 doxorubicin) should be considered (at least 30 min prior to each anthracycline cycle) in adult patients with cancer scheduled to receive a high total cumulative anthracycline dose for curative treatment, and in patients with high and very high CTRCD risk (including those with pre-existing HF or low-normal or reduced
LVEF) where anthracycline chemotherapy is deemed essential.163
Pegylated and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin164,165,168
modify pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution without compromising antitumour efﬁcacy. Pegylated and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin are approved for metastatic BC and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is also approved for advanced ovarian cancer, acquired immune deﬁciency syndrome-related Kaposi sarcoma, and MM. In a recent meta-analysis of 19 trials, in both the adjuvant and metastatic context, liposomal doxorubicin was reported to be less cardiotoxic than conventional doxorubicin.165
Liposomal daunorubicin is also available for acute leukaemia patients in place of daunorubicin when pre-existing
LVD
is present.164,165
5.2.2. Primary prevention of radiation-induced cardiovascular toxicity
Primary prevention of RT-induced damage to the CV system depends on technological advances that allow improved targeting of
RT delivery, thereby maintaining or increasing oncological efﬁcacy while reducing CTR-CVT.169,170 Modern techniques strive to minimize the mean heart dose (MHD), either by shaping the dose distribution (intensity-modulated RT) or by using respiratory management (gating or breath-hold).171,172 Proton therapy offers the potential to further decrease exposure to surrounding healthy organs.173 However, complete cardiac avoidance is not always possible due to the proximity of the tumour (e.g. central lung tumours, mediastinal lymphomas, irradiation of the internal mammary chain in BC). In patients where RT only has a consolidating role and the risk of RT-induced CV injury is very high (e.g.
due to baseline risk factors), a MDT is needed to consider the risk/beneﬁt of RT.171,174
There are no proven medical therapies to prevent RT-induced CV
toxicity. One component of RT-induced CV toxicity is accelerating pre-existing CAD, and therefore tight control of CVRFs is recommended.

5.3. Secondary prevention strategies
Secondary prevention refers to interventions in patients with preexisting CVD, including prior CTR-CVT, and new emerging
CTR-CVT during cancer therapy. CVD and comorbidities should receive the optimal therapy before and during cancer therapy as discussed in previous sections. Regular clinical assessments, physical examinations, and CV investigations (including 12-lead ECG, TTE,
and cardiac biomarkers) are recommended in patients receiving speciﬁc cardiotoxic cancer therapies, with the frequency of surveillance guided by baseline risk and the emergence of new
CTR-CVT.5,12,33,53,54,187–190
5.4. Cardiovascular surveillance during cancer therapies
A careful clinical evaluation and physical examination is recommended during cancer treatment to detect early signs and symptoms of CTR-CVT. ECG monitoring is required in patients at risk of cardiac arrhythmias according to speciﬁc drug protocols.
5.4.1. Cardiac serum biomarkers
During therapy, NP and cTn should be used for CTRCD screening and diagnosis and they may also serve to guide therapy.55,63,191–194
The release of cTn and NP differ for different cancer treatments.
Therefore, an increase in biomarker level should be interpreted in the patient clinical context
(cancer treatment timing and comorbidities).
It is important to consider that generally accepted cut-offs and reference values of CV biomarkers have not been established for patients with cancer or for those who receive cancer therapies. In addition, levels of NP and cTn may differ according to local laboratories and may be altered by many factors, including age, sex, renal function, obesity, infections, and comorbidities such as AF and pulmonary embolism (PE).53,63,195–197
5.4.2. Cardiac imaging
Cardiac imaging plays a critical role in clinical decision-making during the cancer process.72,198 Imaging techniques—particularly advanced echocardiography and CMR—facilitate early diagnosis and management of CTR-CVT.22,54,94 The frequency of cardiac imaging monitoring during therapy should be adapted according to the estimated baseline risk12 and the expected CTR-CVT manifestation.54 The cardiac imaging technique used should be based on local expertise and availability, and the same imaging modality (i.e. 3D-TTE, 2D-TTE,
CMR) is recommended throughout the entire treatment to decrease inter-technique variability.94,199,200 Cardiac imaging should be performed at any time if patients receiving cardiotoxic therapies present with new cardiac symptoms.
New deﬁnitions of CTRCD are presented in Section 3.1 Early recognition of asymptomatic CTRCD allows clinicians to incorporate cardioprotective therapy before there is a signiﬁcant decline in LVEF, which may or may not be reversible, and also decreases the risk of interruptions in cancer therapy, which could otherwise affect patients’ survival.22,43,72,94 For the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic CTRCD during cancer treatment, TTE—including 3D-LVEF and GLS assessment—is the preferred technique to detect and conﬁrm cardiac dysfunction.72,83,93,102 GLS evaluation is particularly important in patients with low-normal LVEF
to conﬁrm or not asymptomatic myocardial damage.201 It is recommended to use the same vendor to analyse GLS during cancer treatment to accurately compare values over time.73 Therefore, a relative change in GLS has been suggested as the ideal tool to identify asymptomatic mild CTRCD.1,4,94 Different thresholds have been considered in the literature in recent years.93,202,203
Currently, a relative GLS decrease of .15% compared with baseline is the recommended threshold as it reﬂects the 95% upper

5.5. Cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity monitoring protocols
5.5.1. Anthracycline chemotherapy
Anthracycline-induced CTRCD is a dose-dependent and cumulative process of variable onset that may present with symptomatic or asymptomatic CTRCD.4
Figure 10 summarizes the recommended monitoring protocol during anthracycline therapy according to baseline CTRCD risk
(Table 4). Clinical assessment combined with cardiac biomarkers
(cTn and NP) and TTE (including 3D-LVEF and GLS when available) can identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic CTRCD
with a reasonably high negative predictive value. This topic has been extensively reviewed in two recent
HFA
position statements.53,54 Classifying patients based on their risk of anthracycline-induced CV toxicity has allowed the early implementation of personalized preventive strategies (Section 5.2.1).14
Patients with pre-existing CVD should be treated with guidelinebased medical therapy.14,19,207
5.5.2. HER2-targeted therapies
HER2-targeted therapies are a crucial part of the treatment of patients with HER2-positive invasive BC in both early and metastatic settings. In the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant settings, drugs currently approved are trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine, and neratinib. In the metastatic setting, trastuzumab,
pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine, tucatinib, and trastuzumab deruxtecan are currently approved.214–216 Trastuzumab can also be used in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric adenocarcinomas in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and either capecitabine or 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU).
It is recognized that anti-HER2 therapies may lead to LVD in up to 15–20% of patients and to overt HF if surveillance is missed, or in high- and very high-risk patients.217–220 LV function surveillance based on LVEF and GLS is recommended prior to and every 3 months during HER2-targeted therapies treatment surveillance (Figure 11).22 However, this single algorithm has not been tested in low- or high-risk patients and increased frequency of assessment (according to local availability) is recommended in high-risk patients.
The use of cardiac serum biomarkers to identify CTRCD is less well-deﬁned during anti-HER2 treatments.217 Measurement of cTn in BC patients after anthracycline-based chemotherapy but prior to trastuzumab should be considered, as an elevated cTn identiﬁes patients at higher risk of trastuzumab-induced
CTRCD. Serial NP measurement was more sensitive than cTn at predicting subsequent declines in LVEF during trastuzumab treatment.74

For patients requiring adjuvant chemotherapy and anti-HER2-targeted therapy, the use of non-anthracycline chemotherapy should be considered by the MDT according to risk of relapse, cardiac risks, and in discussion with the treating oncologist.217 When anthracycline chemotherapy in the
(neo)-adjuvant setting is necessary, sequential use (anthracyclines followed by taxanes and anti-HER2 agents) has been shown to signiﬁcantly decrease the incidence of CTRCD in several adjuvant trials, compared with concomitant use in earlier trials.220–224

5.5.3. Fluoropyrimidines
Fluoropyrimidines such as 5-FU and its oral prodrug capecitabine are mainly used for gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies and advanced
BC.
The most common
CTR-CVTs are angina pectoris,
ischaemia-related ECG abnormalities, hypertension, Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), and MI (even in patients with normal coronary arteries),1,4,10,43,229,230 with rarer CTR-CVT including myocarditis,
arrhythmias, and peripheral arterial toxicity (Raynaud’s phenomenon and ischaemic stroke).231 The incidence of myocardial ischaemia varies according to the dose, scheduling, and route of administration and is up to 10%.232 Among the several mechanisms responsible for
5-FU-induced myocardial ischaemia are coronary vasospasm and endothelial injury.233 Chest pain and ischaemic ECG changes usually occur at rest (less typically during exercise) within days of drug administration and sometimes persist even after treatment cessation.
CTR-CVT risk markedly increases in patients with cancer with preexisting CAD. Aggressive control of modiﬁable CVRFs, according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice,19 is recommended during and after treatment. A baseline TTE is recommended in patients with a history of symptomatic CV to conﬁrm the presence of pre-existing regional wall motion abnormalities or LVD. Screening for CAD may be considered in selected high- and very high-risk patients before the administration of these drugs and according to local protocols and current recommendations.12,234,235
5.5.4. Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors
Aberrant activation of kinases plays a critical role in both the development of numerous cancer types and in CV and metabolic homeostasis. Inhibition of the VEGF signalling pathway is achieved with either monoclonal antibodies (administered i.v.) against circulating
VEGF or with small-molecule TKI (taken orally) targeting VEGF receptors.236 VEGFi are used for the treatment of numerous cancer types, including renal, thyroid, and hepatocellular carcinomas.
However, their use is associated with a wide array of CV complications including hypertension, HF, QTc prolongation, and acute vascular events (Figure 12).131,237–240 It can be challenging to assess the prognosis of patients experiencing severe CV side effects because

these drugs are often used in patients with advanced cancer. The goal must be to continue VEGFi treatment for as long as possible with initiation or optimization of CV treatment if indicated.
Hypertension is a class effect and is the most reported adverse event under VEGFi treatment. It occurs within hours or days, is dosedependent,
and is usually reversed by
VEGFi discontinuation.131,239,241–243 The risk is higher in patients with pre-existing hypertension or CVD, previous anthracycline treatment, advanced age, history of smoking, hyperlipidaemia, and/or obesity (Table 4).4,244
LVD and HF occur in a minority of patients in RCTs,245 but are reported more frequently in routine practice246 and are often reversible.247 Acute arterial events (aortic dissection, stroke, arterial thrombosis,
acute coronary events, vasospasm)
and venous thromboembolism (VTE) can also complicate treatment with
VEGFi.248 QTc prolongation has been described with sunitinib, sorafenib, and vandetanib,249 but it is rarely related to severe arrhythmic events, except with vandetanib.250 Some small-molecule TKI (e.g.

A baseline CV risk assessment includes clinical examination, BP
measurement, and an ECG with baseline QTcF measurement (see
Section 4).20 Especially in patients with known hypertension, BP
should be controlled before VEGFi therapy. A baseline TTE is recommended for high- and very high-risk patients.14 Patients with impaired LV function and/or patients at high or very high risk of developing HF should be referred to the cardiologist before starting

Monitoring during and after treatment is indicated for all patients treated with a VEGFi and is based on close clinical follow-up using serial ECGs, biomarkers, and echocardiography. Early recognition and treatment of hypertension are essential to prevent other CV
complications, especially HF. Home BP monitoring is recommended daily during the ﬁrst cycle, after each increase of anticancer therapy dose, and every 2–3 weeks thereafter.138,254,255 When treatment with a VEGFi is stopped, a drop in BP must be anticipated and
BP-lowering therapy must be reduced and/or interrupted accordingly (Section 6).
In patients at risk of QTc prolongation, regular monitoring of the
QTc interval is recommended after a dose increase, whenever other
QT-prolonging agents are added, or if electrolyte imbalances occur
(Section 6).
Patients treated with a VEGFi must also be screened regularly for symptoms and clinical signs of HF. Regular NP measurement and echocardiography can be useful for the detection of
CTRCD,
although evidence is weak

5.5.5. Multitargeted kinase inhibitors targeting
BCR-ABL
Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) results from aberrant activation of ABL1 kinase due to a chromosomal translocation.
Small-molecule TKIs targeting BCR-ABL—including imatinib,
bosutinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib—have proven effective in the treatment of CML. The toxicities associated with these TKIs are unique and due to ‘off-target’ effects of each drug. Dasatinib is associated with group 1 pulmonary hypertension (PH), HF, and pleural and pericardial effusion,
whereas nilotinib and ponatinib are generally associated with vascular events
(Figure
14).131,256–259
Secondgeneration BCR-ABL TKI may induce a QTc prolongation
(see Section 6.4.2). CV toxicity risk is higher in patients aged .65 years (relative risk 1.8) and in those with underlying DM (relative risk 2.5), hypertension (relative risk 3.2) or pre-existing
CAD
(relative risk
2.6).256–258,260
Before
BCR-ABL TKI therapy, it is critical to deﬁne baseline CV toxicity risk with special attention to BP, glucose, and lipids.

5.5.6. Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors
Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors are increasingly used to treat lymphoid malignancies. Ibrutinib, a ﬁrst-in-class irreversible oral inhibitor of BTK, has proven highly effective in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and related B-cell malignancies including mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and marginal zone lymphomas.262 These disorders are usually diagnosed in elderly patients in whom frequent comorbidities coexist at diagnosis that increase the risk of CTR-CVT.263,264 Ibrutinib has been associated with bleeding diathesis, infections, and an increased risk of hypertension, AF, and HF.265–267 Ibrutinib may also cause ventricular arrhythmias without prolonging QT.267,268 Acalabrutinib is a secondgeneration BTK inhibitor with greater BTK selectivity. In a recent phase III, randomized, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority study,
acalabrutinib demonstrated a non-inferior progression-free survival compared to ibrutinib in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with a lower incidence of symptomatic CV
events.269 However, grade ≥3 AF (symptomatic AF where urgent intervention is indicated)270 and AF in patients ≥75 years old or with previous AF history were comparable between groups, as was the risk of CV events in patients with pre-existing CVRFs or CVD.271
Therefore, we currently do not have enough data to establish different monitoring strategies in patients treated with these drugs.
Due to the lack of evidence-based recommendations, the management of these CV events is challenging.264 Antihypertensive initiation has been associated with a lower risk of a major adverse CV events
(MACE).264 Opportunistic screening for AF by pulse-taking or ECG
rhythm strip is recommended at every clinical visit during BTK inhibitor therapy.272
Due to a higher bleeding risk, ibrutinib should be temporarily interrupted in patients requiring dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
and 3–7 days before invasive procedures. In case of emergency interventions, platelet transfusion should be considered to minimize bleeding risks.262

inhibition of the proteasome, or transient endothelial dysfunction.281,283 Although no studies have yet addressed the optimal follow-up scheme in patients with MM treated with PI, a common scheme consists of 3–6-monthly visits with ECG, complete blood

Hypertension, another adverse effect of PI, may also contribute to the development of HFpEF.
Patients with MM are at elevated risk of thrombosis due to both patient- and myeloma-related factors, particularly the combination of PI and IMiD (Figure 18).279,287,291–297 In the ASPIRE

Oncological guidelines recommend the use of aspirin or prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) in lowrisk patients receiving thalidomide- or lenalidomide-based regimens.298 In patients at high risk of VTE, therapeutic doses of
LMWH are recommended.299 The role of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in MM patients needs further validation in larger trials, but recent small studies have conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy and safety of low doses of apixaban and rivaroxaban for

5.5.8. Rapidly accelerated ﬁbrosarcoma and mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor treatment
The rapidly accelerated ﬁbrosarcoma (RAF) inhibitors—vemurafenib,
dabrafenib, and encorafenib—are approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. The mitogenactivated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors—
trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib, and selumetinib—have also shown signiﬁcant clinical activity in melanoma patients whose tumour contains a BRAF V600 mutation, and are now largely used in combination with RAF inhibitors. The main CV effects to be considered are hypertension, PE, and CTRCD, which are associated with all combinations of RAF and MEK inhibitors, and QTc prolongation, associated solely with the coadministration of cobimetinib and vemurafenib (Figure 19).12,308,309 RAF inhibitor treatment alone or in combination with a MEK inhibitor is associated with an increased risk of MI and AF.308
Patients with cancer with pre-existing CVD have an increased frequency of CV adverse events during treatment with MEK
and RAF inhibitors, and therefore baseline risk stratiﬁcation is recommended.12 Most cardiac complications induced by administration of MEK and RAF inhibitors seem to be attributable to the MEK inhibitor, with the RAF inhibitor enhancing the toxic effects of the MEK inhibitor.310–313 Hypertension and LVD
were twice as frequent when MEK and RAF inhibitors were coadministered compared with single therapy with RAF inhibitor alone.314
CTRCD can manifest any time from the ﬁrst month of therapy to 2 years after the end of the oncological treatment.315
Baseline TTE is recommended in patients at moderate to high risk of CTR-CVT. During treatment, it is necessary to monitor
BP at each visit and promote weekly outpatient monitoring during the ﬁrst 3 months and monthly thereafter. In patients treated with cobimetinib/vemurafenib, an ECG is recommended at 2
and 4 weeks after initiation of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. In high-risk patients, periodic monitoring of ventricular function with echocardiography should be considered every 6–12 months.

and beta-blockers) have not been evaluated in patients treated with MEK and RAF inhibitors but, from a mechanistic perspective,
beta-blockers might prevent CTRCD induced by MEK inhibitors.
The MEK/ERK pathway has a cardiac protective effect, regulated by beta-adrenergic signalling, which also controls the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway, associated with cardiotoxic effects. Beta-blockers might exert their cardioprotective effects by reducing p38 signalling.315

5.5.9. Immune checkpoint inhibitors
Immunotherapies, which harness the immune system to destroy cancer cells, come in different forms but the most widely used are ICI.316 The immune checkpoints are proteins expressed in the T cells that inhibit their activation when they contact a body cell. ICI include monoclonal antibodies that block the immune brakes or regulators,

lymphocyte-associated antigen-4
(CTLA-4)
(ipilimumab,
tremelimumab), programmed death-1 (PD-1) (nivolumab, cemiplimab, pembrolizumab), and programmed death-ligand 1
(PD-L1) (atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab) expressed in the cancer cells, with the consequent cytotoxic immune response. By blocking these checkpoints from binding with their partner proteins, ICI inhibit the ‘off’ signal, activating T cells and promoting killing of cancer cells. Although their pathophysiology is not clearly deﬁned, ICI may also trigger an

overactivation of T cells against non-cancerous tissues, leading to immune-related adverse events.317 Immune-related CV side effects may lead to life-threatening CV complications such as fulminant myocarditis, myopericarditis, cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, or MI, which often results in the discontinuation of
ICI.318,319
The largest case series of 122 patients with ICI-associated myocarditis had early onset of symptoms (median of 30 days after initial exposure to ICI), and up to 50% died.320 Late CV
events (.90 days) are less well characterized but generally exhibit a higher risk of non-inﬂammatory HF, progressive atherosclerosis,
hypertension,
and mortality rates.321
Other
CV
toxicities described during ICI therapy are MI, AV block, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias,
sudden death,
Takotsubo-like syndrome, non-inﬂammatory HF, hypercholesterolaemia, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, ischaemic stroke,
and VTE.322 A meta-analysis including 32 518 patients receiving
ICI treatment reported an increased risk of myocarditis, pericardial diseases, HF, dyslipidaemia, MI, and cerebral arterial ischaemia.323 Conditions related with high baseline ICI-related
CV toxicity risk include dual ICI therapy (e.g. ipilimumab and nivolumab), combination ICI therapy with other cardiotoxic therapies, and patients with ICI-related non-CV events or prior
CTRCD or CVD (Figure 20).324,325 All patients on ICI treatment should have an ECG and troponin assay at baseline
(Figure 20).326–329 High-risk patients should additionally have a
TTE evaluation at baseline. Due to the lack of evidence-based recommendations, the monitoring of ICI therapy is challenging.
Once started on therapy, ECG, cTn, and NP should be checked.330–332 In the JAVELIN trial, which assessed avelumab plus axitinib vs. sunitinib, no clinical value was observed for ontreatment routine TTE monitoring in asymptomatic patients.333
However, in high-risk patients, and in those with high baseline cTn levels, TTE monitoring may be considered. In patients who develop ECG abnormalities, new biomarker changes, or new cardiac symptoms at any time, prompt cardio-oncology evaluation is strongly recommended, including TTE for the evaluation of LVEF and GLS, and CMR when myocarditis is suspected (Table 3).334
5.5.10. Androgen deprivation therapies for prostate cancer
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is prescribed in 40% of men with prostate cancer as neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy to
RT or for biochemical relapse following prostate cancer surgery.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are the most frequently prescribed ADT. However, GnRH agonists are associated with an increased CV risk and mortality, particularly in patients with prostate cancer aged .60 years.337,338 Baseline risk stratiﬁcation in patients requiring GnRH agonists depends on vascular disease risk (Figure 21).339,340 No dedicated CV toxicity risk calculators have been developed for patients receiving ADT. It was the consensus of the authors to recommend SCORE2 or SCORE2-OP to stratify CV
risk in patients receiving ADT without previous CVD.19
The use of GnRH antagonists represents an alternative in the treatment of prostate cancer, and preclinical and clinical (HERO
trial)341 data suggest that GnRH antagonist use is associated with signiﬁcantly lower overall mortality and CV events compared with agonists.342 However, more research is needed in this ﬁeld. In the
PRONOUNCE trial, no difference in MACE at 1 year was observed between degarelix (a GnRH antagonist) and leuprolide (a GnRH
agonist), although the trial was stopped early.343 Lower CV event rates were detected compared with previous studies and all patients were reviewed by a cardiologist at enrolment (leading to optimal
CVRF management).343
The main CV effects to be considered are hypertension, DM, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and CTRCD.339,344 ADT is uncommonly associated with QTc prolongation and rarely causes torsade de pointes
(TdP) through blockade of testosterone effects on ventricular repolarization.345,346 ECG monitoring and correction of QT prolongation precipitant factors (see Section 6.4.2; Table 9; Supplementary data,
Table S13) is recommended340,347,348 during prostate cancer treatment if the baseline QTc interval is prolonged.49,339,340,347,349,350

5.5.11. Endocrine therapies for breast cancer
Endocrine therapy is a common treatment as 65–70% of all early and metastatic BC patients develop hormone receptor-positive disease.22 Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen,
toremifene) or aromatase inhibitors (AI) (letrozole, anastrozole,
or exemestane) are recommended in early BC (EBC) according to menopausal status, comorbidities, and the risk of disease relapse.
The use of AI in combination with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
4/6 inhibitors is recommended as ﬁrst- or second-line therapy in patient with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative metastatic BC.
The use of AI increases the risk of dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, HF, and MI.339 In the ATAC (‘Arimidex’ and
Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial, anastrozole-treated patients with pre-existing CAD experienced more CV events (17%
vs. 10%) and cholesterol level elevation (9% vs. 5%) than those treated with tamoxifen.351,352 Similarly, HF was signiﬁcantly more common with letrozole compared with tamoxifen in the BIG (Breast
International Group) 1–98 trial.353 Longer AI treatment duration was associated with increased odds of developing CVD in two large meta-analyses.354,355 Signiﬁcantly increased VTE risk has been consistently demonstrated with tamoxifen351,353 and it is not recommended in patients with thrombotic risks. Toremifene and high-dose tamoxifen were found to prolong QTc interval339,340;
however, no risk data have been published in patients treated with the standard tamoxifen dose used in BC (20 mg/day).
The risks of VTE, hypercholesterolaemia, and CVD should be discussed with patients, while recognizing that the absolute beneﬁts of preventing BC recurrence usually outweigh the CV risks.339 In patients ,70 years old without clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic disease, estimation of 10-year fatal and non-fatal CVD risk with
SCORE2
(if
≥70
years,
SCORE2-OP)
is recommended.19
Cholesterol levels and BP should be monitored regularly in patients receiving AI.356 Physical activity and healthy diet are also advised to reduce weight and cholesterol levels. Smoking cessation is strongly recommended to reduce CV risk (e.g. CAD during AI therapy and
VTE during tamoxifen therapy).
5.5.12. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors
The use of CDK 4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) in combination with endocrine therapy is approved for the treatment of patients with hormone receptor-positive/
HER2-negative metastatic BC. This combination has resulted in improvements in progression-free survival and, in some trials, overall survival.357–359 CDK 4/6 inhibitors have demonstrated a potential for QT prolongation,339,360 particularly with ribociclib. The phase
III trials of ribociclib incorporated routine ECG monitoring.361–368

Baseline ECG is recommended and ECGs should be repeated at day
14 of the ﬁrst cycle, before the second cycle, with any dose increase and as clinically indicated.357
In patients who already have, or are at signiﬁcant risk of developing, QT prolongation (Section 6.4.2), the risks/beneﬁts for ribociclib should be discussed by a MDT. Importantly, the use of ribociclib should be avoided in combination with drugs known to prolong
QT interval and/or strong CYP3A inhibitors.357
The prescribing information does not recommend ribociclib in combination with tamoxifen due to a higher risk of QTc prolongation.252,367
5.5.13. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors
Patients with cancer treated with anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) inhibitors may develop adverse CV events including sinus bradycardia, AV block, QTc prolongation, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, and dyslipidaemia.370,371 ACS and HF have rarely been described under crizotinib.372 A baseline ECG is recommended in patients prior to starting an ALK inhibitor, especially crizotinib,
and patients may have an ECG 4 weeks after the start of treatment and every 3–6 months thereafter, particularly if the baseline ECG is abnormal. Home BP monitoring should be considered in patients treated with brigatinib or lorlatinib. Patients receiving lorlatinib or crizotinib treatment should have cholesterol levels checked every
3–6 months and treated if elevated.
5.5.14. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors
Osimertinib is an oral irreversible, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)-TKI approved for patients with non-small cell lung cancer expressing EGFR mutations. Recent data have shown that osimertinib is associated with an increased risk of QTc prolongation, AF, VTE, LVD,
and HF (Figure 22).373,374 A study of 123 patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer treated with osimertinib reported a 4.9%
incidence of HF or MI and a signiﬁcant decrease in LVEF ,53% in
11% of patients with TTE surveillance.375 Pre-existing hypertension and older age are risk factors for LVD and HF (3.9% and 2.6% incidence, respectively).376 LVD and HF were more common during the ﬁrst year of therapy.376
Baseline CV risk stratiﬁcation, ECG and TTE prior to starting osimertinib is recommended. Three-monthly echocardiographic surveillance for new LVD during osimertinib treatment should be considered. Close monitoring of magnesium levels is also recommended to minimize the risk of osimertinib-induced hypomagnesaemia and QTc prolongation.

5.5.15. Chimeric antigen receptor
T cell and tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes therapies
CAR-T therapy is used for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukaemia and aggressive B-cell lymphomas.377 Although the reported incidence is variable, there is a growing recognition of the association between CAR-T therapy and CTR-CVT, including LVD, HF, cardiac arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, TTS, and cardiac arrest.378–383 The majority of the described CV toxicities have been shown to be associated with the occurrence of cytokine release syndrome
(CRS).377,384 Baseline CV evaluation including ECG, NP, and cTn is recommended in all patients. Baseline TTE should also be considered, especially in patients with pre-existing CVRF and CVD. After receiving CAR-T therapy, patients may develop systemic inﬂammatory syndromes.385 CRS should be suspected when a patient develops fever, with or without tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension,
hypoxia, and/or other end-organ dysfunction hours to days after treatment.385 A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose
CRS and to distinguish it from other conditions that occur in these settings (infections, HF, drug reactions, and PE).378,386 Among adults,
there was a relationship between CRS and CV events. An elevation in cTn is commonly seen in patients with CRS and is associated with an increased risk for subsequent CV events.378 In a recent retrospective pharmacovigilance study, CAR-T was associated with tachyarrhythmias (AF the most common, followed by ventricular arrhythmias),

5.5.16. Radiotherapy
RT increases the risk of developing subsequent CVD and peripheral artery disease (PAD).173,389–394 There is ongoing debate regarding the safest radiation dose, which cardiac substructures are most sensitive to RT-induced injury, and the most appropriate strategies to minimize RT-related CVD.395,396 The heart is considered a radiosensitive ‘organ at risk’ during RT and radiation exposure to the heart should be kept as low as reasonably achievable because there is no ‘safe’ dose (Figure 23).389,390 RT-induced CV
toxicity risk categorization based on MHD389,397 is recommended over categorization based on prescribed dose, which may not accurately reﬂect cardiac radiation exposure (e.g. 35 Gray [Gy] prescribed dose to approximately 70% of the heart is equivalent to approximately 25 Gy MHD, whereas 35 Gy prescribed dose to approximately 40% of the heart is equivalent to approximately 15 Gy
MHD). However, MHD is not a perfect metric, and in some patients, a very small portion of the heart might be irradiated to a very high dose, still conveying a substantial risk despite a low
MHD.398 Therefore, depending on dose distribution and exposure of speciﬁc cardiac substructures and CVRFs, the cancer treatment team may judge the patient to belong to a higher-risk category.397,399–401
Strategies to prevent and attenuate CV complications of RT
have focused on reducing radiation exposure of the heart and
CV substructures during cancer treatment and include the following.
(1) Modiﬁcation of cancer management to omit RT. This emphasizes the importance of integrating a personalized cardio-oncology evaluation.402–404
(2) Modiﬁcation of the dose and volume of RT treatments where possible. RT protocols should target the minimum volume required to the minimum dose needed to obtain the desired clinical beneﬁt.
(3) Modiﬁcation of delivery techniques to reduce cardiac radiation exposure should lead to a considerable reduction in risk.
Modern heart-sparing RT strategies include: the optimal use of modern intensity-modulated photon RT technologies; the use of deep inspiration breath-hold or respiratory-gated techniques in BC,405 lymphoma,406 and lung cancer407; or the use of imageguided RT to ensure accuracy of delivery and proton beam therapy.408
The incidence of cardiac events following RT may vary according to patient risk factors and synergistic effects of radiation with other cardiotoxic cancer treatments.12,173
There are no known RT-speciﬁc secondary preventative measures (e.g. drug treatments) to reduce the risk of CV events following
RT.
However,
given the known importance of conventional CVRF on the incidence of RT-related events, optimization of modiﬁable CVRF is recommended in all patients before and after RT.
5.5.17. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation
HSCT constitutes a potentially curative therapeutic option for many haematological malignancies. Improvements in HSCT techniques and supportive strategies have markedly decreased treatment-related mortality (Supplementary data, Table S14).409,410 There is a growing recognition of HSCT-related CV toxicities and HSCT survivors constitute a population at high future CV risk. Several factors contribute to deﬁne the risk of HSCT-related CV toxicities, including the HSCT

GVHD is associated with thrombosis and inﬂammatory myocardial damage (myocarditis, HF, conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias,
and pericardial effusions), and chronic GVHD has been linked with increasing risk of hypertension, DM, and dyslipidaemia.415,416
A comprehensive CV evaluation, including NP assessment, ECG,
and TTE, has become a core component of the pre-HSCT assessment409,410 to detect undiagnosed CVD, stratify CTR-CVT risk,
and optimize pre-existing CV conditions.411,417–420 In early surveillance, TTE monitoring is recommended in high-risk HSCT recipients at 3 and 12 months as LVEF and GLS can decrease after transplant
(see Section 7). Independent factors associated with long-term CVD
in HSCT survivors are allogenic HSCT, pre-existing CVD or multiple uncontrolled CVRF, cancer treatment history (mediastinal or mantle ﬁeld radiation, alkylating agents, .250 mg/m2 doxorubicin or equivalent), high-risk conditioning schemes (total body irradiation,
alkylating agents), and GVHD.410 Figure 24 summarizes strategies for the prevention and attenuation of CV complications in patients undergoing HSCT.

5.5.18. Other cancer treatments
Several other cancer therapies may also induce clinically relevant CV
events. Cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) can induce myocardial dysfunction and HF.4
Cyclophosphamide CV toxicity is primarily seen in patients receiving high doses (.140 mg/kg) before HSCT and typically occurs within days of drug administration.410
Platinum-containing chemotherapy (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin) may cause vascular disease (vasospasm, MI, and venous and arterial thrombosis). These may occur during treatment and also contribute to increased long-term risk of CAD in survivors.
Patients with testicular cancer treated with cisplatin have a higher risk for vascular disease at long-term follow-up.421 The risk of the individual patient is still hard to predict, but lifestyle interventions, a high degree of clinical suspicion in patients who experience chest pain, and close CVRF monitoring is recommended during and after therapy.422 Cisplatin422 infrequently causes HF; however, because it requires the administration of a high i.v. volume to avoid renal toxicity, patients with pre-existing CVD may develop symptomatic HF.
Arsenic trioxide is used to treat some leukaemias and myelomas.
Arsenic trioxide frequently prolongs the QT interval (26–93% of patients), and life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias have been reported.45,259 QTc prolongation was observed 1–5 weeks after arsenic trioxide infusion and then returned towards baseline by the end of 8 weeks. Patients receiving treatment with arsenic trioxide should be monitored weekly with ECG during the ﬁrst 8 weeks of therapy.
Electrolyte monitoring is also required as arsenic trioxide may induce hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and renal dysfunction. Risk factors for QT prolongation should be controlled before, during, and after cancer treatment (Section 6.4.2).
Several FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors (ﬁrst-generation:
midostaurin; second-generation: gilteritinib) have been tested for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemias. Gilterinib-induced differentiation syndrome (fever, dyspnoea, pleuropericardial effusion, pulmonary oedema, peripheral oedema, hypotension, renal dysfunction, and rash) requires early corticosteroid therapy and haemodynamic monitoring until resolution of symptoms. Midostaurin and gilterinib may prolong QTc interval and close electrolyte surveillance and minimizing drug–drug interactions are required (see Section 6.4.2; Table 9;
Supplementary data, Tables S15 and S16).423
6. Diagnosis and management of acute and subacute cardiovascular toxicity in patients receiving anticancer treatment
A coordinated MDT is recommended to discuss patients with cancer who develop acute CV complications of their cancer treatment.5
Referral to a specialized cardio-oncology service is recommended for patients with cancer who present with new CTR-CVT during and after cancer treatment.12 The prevention and management of
CVD in patients with cancer should generally follow published ESC
Guidelines for speciﬁc CVD. This chapter provides guidance on the management of CTR-CVT that occur during cancer treatment,
and highlights where management differs for patients with cancer compared with those without. The decision to initiate CV treatment
(medication, devices) needs to include consideration of a range of factors including both cancer and CV symptom burden, cancer prognosis, ongoing cancer treatment requirements including alternative options, possible adverse drug reactions, drug–drug interactions,
and patient preferences. An extensive list of drug–drug interactions is provided in Supplementary data, Tables S15–S17.
6.1. Cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction
6.1.1. Anthracycline chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction
CTRCD during anthracycline chemotherapy may present clinically or be detected in asymptomatic patients during surveillance (Figure 10;
Table 3).4 The diagnosis of anthracycline chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction includes new CV symptoms, new abnormalities in cardiac function on CV imaging, and/or new increases in cardiac biomarkers (Table 3). A MDT discussion is recommended to consider the risk/beneﬁt ratio of continuing anthracycline chemotherapy in patients who develop new CTRCD.
Discontinuation of anthracycline chemotherapy is recommended in patients with cancer who develop severe symptomatic CTRCD.22
There are rare exceptions where rechallenge with further anthracycline chemotherapy may be considered after a MDT discussion, using prevention strategies described below and under close monitoring with each cycle of anthracycline chemotherapy. Temporary interruption of anthracycline chemotherapy is recommended in patients who develop moderate symptomatic CTRCD, and in patients who develop moderate or severe asymptomatic CTRCD. A MDT approach regarding interruption vs. continuation of anthracycline chemotherapy is recommended in patients who develop mild symptomatic
CTRCD.
Guideline-based HF therapy is recommended in patients who develop symptomatic CTRCD or asymptomatic moderate or severe
CTRCD during anthracycline chemotherapy. The use of an ACE-I/
ARB or angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is recommended unless the drugs are contraindicated or not tolerated. Up-titration to target doses as described in the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic HF is recommended.14 ACE-I, ARB, and/or beta-blockers

CTRCD, after recovery of LV function under HF treatment. If there is a compelling reason to continue anthracycline chemotherapy,
three other strategies exist in addition to continuing ACE-I/ARB

HER2-targeted therapy. In patients with mild symptomatic
CTRCD, a MDT approach is recommended to continue vs. interrupt HER2-targeted therapy.

50% with a signiﬁcant new GLS reduction and/or cardiac biomarker increase), continuing HER2-targeted treatment is recommended and cardioprotective therapy
(ACE-I/ARB

6.1.3. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis and non-inﬂammatory heart failure
Myocarditis is a severe complication of ICI with a high fatality rate that most frequently develops during the ﬁrst 12 weeks of treatment, although late cases (after week 20) may occur.386
Other ICI-related CV toxicities include dyslipidaemia, ACS, vasculitis, AV block, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, sudden death, TTS, non-inﬂammatory LVD, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and ischaemic stroke, with higher risks for myocarditis
(odds ratio
4.42)
and dyslipidaemia
(odds ratio
3.68)
(Figure 27).323,325
The diagnosis of ICI-associated myocarditis is initially based on the presence of symptoms, a new increase in troponin (associated with either CV symptoms or non-CV immuno-related adverse events),
and new ECG abnormalities (AV or intraventricular conduction disorders,
bradycardia,
tachyarrhythmias)
(see
Section
3;
Table 3).17,434,435 Any abnormal ﬁnding should prompt urgent CV imaging and other causes of myocardial injury (e.g. ACS, acute infectious myocarditis) should be excluded. Treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone should be promptly initiated in haemodynamically unstable patients (including those with ventricular arrhythmias
[VA] or complete AV block) while awaiting further conﬁrmatory testing.436 TTE and CMR are recommended in all patients with suspected ICI-associated myocarditis. Currently, speciﬁc CMR features for ICI-induced myocarditis are not well described and modiﬁed Lake
Louise criteria are recommended (Table 3).18 Cardiac ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) may be considered437,438 if CMR is not available or contraindicated, although PET
sensitivity is low and requires a strict 18-h carbohydrate-free fast.439 Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) should be considered in cases where the diagnosis is suspected but not conﬁrmed non-invasively
(e.g. conﬂicting results of cardiac imaging and biomarkers or clinically unstable patients).440 All cases of ICI-associated myocarditis should be classiﬁed according to the severity of the myocarditis (fulminant

Interruption of ICI treatment is recommended in all cases of suspected ICI-associated myocarditis (any patient developing new cardiac symptoms, new cardiac arrhythmias, new heart blocks, or new troponin increase who has received an ICI therapy in the past 12 weeks) while investigations are performed. Once the abnormal ﬁndings have resolved, a MDT discussion is recommended to determine the risk/beneﬁt to permanent stopping vs.
resuming ICI treatment in patients with suspected but not conﬁrmed myocarditis.
Cessation of ICI treatment is recommended in patients with cancer with fulminant or non-fulminant ICI-associated myocarditis and the patient should be admitted to hospital and a level 2 or 3 bed with continuous ECG monitoring is required. CV complications should be treated as per speciﬁc ESC Guidelines (HF,14 tachyarrhythmias,441,442 AV block,443 or pericardial effusion444).
Treatment of both non-fulminant and fulminant ICI-associated myocarditis with methylprednisolone 500–1000 mg i.v. bolus once daily for the ﬁrst 3–5 days should be started as soon as possible,
once the diagnosis is considered likely, to reduce MACE including mortality.386,436 If clinical improvement is observed (cTn reduced by .50% from peak level within 24–72 h and any LVD, AV block,

recommended starting at 1 mg/kg up to 80 mg/day. Although the most appropriate weaning off protocol is not conﬁrmed, a weekly reduction of oral prednisolone (most commonly by 10 mg per week) under clinical, ECG, and cTn surveillance should be considered (Figure 28). A reassessment of LV function and cTn should be considered when the prednisolone dose is reduced to 20 mg/day and then continue weaning the prednisolone by 5 mg per week to
5 mg/day, and a ﬁnal reduction from 5 mg/day in 1-mg per week steps.

There is a lack of data to recommend a speciﬁc second-line immunosuppression regimen and MDT discussion is recommended. Several agents are currently being investigated with promising results from case series including i.v. mycophenolate mofetil, anti-thymocyte globulin (anti-CD3
antibody), i.v. immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, tocilizumab, abatacept
(CTLA-4 agonist), alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 antibody), and tofacitinib.
Caution is advised against the use of inﬂiximab for steroid-refractory myocarditis and HF.447,448 Patients with fulminant ICI-associated myocarditis, complicated by haemodynamic and/or electrical instability, require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and cardiogenic shock should be managed according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic HF.14 A single dose of i.v. methylprednisolone should be considered in clinically unstable patients with cancer where ICI-induced myocarditis is suspected at presentation but before deﬁnitive diagnosis can be conﬁrmed.
Following recovery from ICI-associated myocarditis and weaning of oral steroid therapy, MDT discussion is recommended to review the decision on whether to restart ICI treatment. This depends on various factors including the severity of the ICI-associated myocarditis (fulminant vs. non-fulminant vs. asymptomatic), alternative oncology treatment options,
metastatic vs.
adjuvant/neoadjuvant indication, and reducing from dual ICI to single ICI treatment if triggered by combination ICI treatment.449
Non-inﬂammatory HF syndromes have also been observed in patients treated with ICI. These include TTS, non-inﬂammatory HF or
LVD,450 and post-MI HF.451,452 Non-inﬂammatory HF is generally a late event and the diagnostic workﬂow should be based on deﬁning the HF phenotype and excluding myocarditis, TTS, and ACS.14 There is also evidence that vasculitis and CAD can occur after ICI treatment.335 HF treatment as per the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic HF is indicated,14 but there is no indication for immunosuppression if myocarditis has been excluded.
Interruption vs. continuing ICI therapy depends on the severity of the HF syndrome and each case should be reviewed by a MDT.
Arrhythmias, such as AF, can be seen in patients with ICI therapy without myocarditis (e.g. ICI-associated thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis,
ICI-associated pericarditis, or ICI-associated severe systemic inﬂammatory syndromes). ICI treatment can be continued after excluding myocarditis.

6.1.4. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell and tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes therapies and heart dysfunction
Although no large-scale studies on the multiple CV complications among adults treated with CAR-T therapies exist, small studies and case reports have shown that CV complications represent around 20% of adverse events.378 CV complications are associated with high mortality rates, and are secondary to CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. The most common
CV complications in patients receiving CAR-T therapies are arrhythmias (77.6%), including QTc prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias,
and AF; HF (14.3%); and MI and VTE (0.5%).455 When suspected, a resting 12-lead ECG, continuous ECG monitoring, TTE, and cTn and NP are recommended. Admission to ICU (level 3) is recommended in severe cases due to the risk of malignant cardiac arrhythmias, circulatory collapse, and multiorgan system failure. In general,
the degree of elevation of cytokines correlates with the severity of
CRS. C-reactive protein is not speciﬁc for CRS and changes in
C-reactive protein may lag behind clinical changes by ≥12 h. A dramatic elevation of interleukin-6 is a supportive ﬁnding for the diagnosis of CRS. Management of the speciﬁc CV complication should follow ESC Guidelines, with additional management of the CRS
(e.g. the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, and dexamethasone).381

Although CV complications are common with TIL therapies, survival does not appear to be signiﬁcantly affected. The most frequent
CV events are hypotension that may require treatment with i.v. ﬂuids and pressors, AF, and to a lesser extent, cTn elevation suggestive of myocardial damage.380 Further research is needed to deﬁne mechanisms and potential prevention strategies to help clinicians with the management of these CV events.
6.1.5. Heart failure during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation
CV complications during HSCT, including congestive HF,456 arterial events, tamponade, and rhythm disturbances (AF, atrial ﬂutter, and supraventricular tachycardia),457 are uncommon but clinically relevant, and should be treated as per speciﬁc ESC Guidelines (HF,14 tachyarrhythmias,273,441 pericardial effusion,444 or acute coronary syndrome458). Studies of treatments during HSCT to prevent both acute and late CV toxicity are limited.145 ACE-I and beta-blockers may be effective,
but this requires further conﬁrmation.
Outpatient and home-based exercise and education programmes instituted after HSCT can improve exercise capacity and quality of life,459 and the role of exercise pre-habilitation prior to HSCT is being investigated.460,461
6.1.6. Takotsubo syndrome and cancer
The prevalence of malignant diseases is high in patients with TTS
and is a risk factor for worse outcomes. Malignancy itself, some cancer treatments (5-FU, ICI, VEGFi), and the stress associated with the diagnosis, investigations, and treatment are recognized triggers or predisposing factors for TTS.462–466 Diagnosis using general TTS criteria is recommended.467,468 Investigations in a patient with cancer with suspected TTS should include clinical examination, ECG, TTE, cardiac biomarkers (cTn and NP), and CMR
(Figure 29).468,469 Most patients require invasive coronary angiography to exclude acute MI. In patients with advanced malignancy or signiﬁcant thrombocytopaenia where invasive coronary angiography is contraindicated, a CCTA is recommended. Cardiac imaging studies should be performed as early as possible when the diagnosis is suspected as LVD can be transient, and if signiﬁcant
LVD is detected then repeat imaging to conﬁrm recovery is recommended.
Interruption of the culprit cancer drug in patients with TTS is recommended. QT-prolonging drugs should be avoided.467 In cases of
ICI-associated TTS, the role of immunosuppression is unknown and if myocardial inﬂammation is present in a TTS pattern on CMR then i.v. methylprednisolone is recommended given the overlap between
ICI-induced TTS and ICI-induced myocarditis. Limited information exists regarding the feasibility of ICI rechallenge following TTS and after recovery of LV function.
A MDT discussion is recommended after recovery from the acute phase of TTS and, if restarting the culprit cancer drug is required from an oncology perspective, regular cardiac biomarker monitoring is recommended (e.g. cTn and NP measured before every ICI cycle, and TTE if a new rise in cardiac biomarkers occurs)
(Figure 29).
6.2. Coronary artery disease
6.2.1. Acute coronary syndromes
Patients with cancer are at increased risk of CAD because of shared
CVRFs34 and CV toxicity of cancer therapy12 compounded by a cancer-induced pro-inﬂammatory and prothrombotic state
(Table 7).467,468,470–473
Current knowledge on ACS in patients with cancer is based on observational data and registries demonstrating that, especially when diagnosed within 1 year, they are at increased risk for major
CV events, bleeding, and cardiac and non-cardiac mortality.474–480
The proportion of ACS patients with a diagnosis of cancer is rising and constitutes about 3% of large series.475
Diagnosis of ACS is based on the same principles as in patients without cancer, including symptoms, an early 12-lead ECG, and serial measurements of hs-cTn for patients presenting with possible non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS).458 Clinical presentation can be atypical481 or masked by cancer or therapy-related side effects; therefore, diagnostic suspicion should be increased in patients at high CV risk or treated with vascular cardiotoxic therapies

(Table 7). Echocardiography improves the diagnostic precision in patients with atypical symptoms and assesses for other cardiac causes of chest pain.
Management of ACS in patients with cancer can be challenging because of frailty, increased bleeding risk, thrombocytopaenia, increased thrombotic risk, and the possible need for future surgery/interventions.482 Cancer treatment should be temporarily interrupted, and an urgent multidisciplinary approach5 is indicated to plan an individualized guideline-based management, taking into account cancer status,
prognosis, and the patient’s preferences regarding invasive management. As in patients without cancer, admission to a monitored unit and initiation of appropriate anti-ischaemic and antithrombotic treatment are indicated, in the absence of contraindications.
A large retrospective propensity score-matching analysis found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), despite its lower use, was strongly associated with lower adjusted
MACE
and all-cause mortality in patients with cancer
(Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas and breast, lung, colon,
and prostate cancers).483 Therefore, immediate coronary angiography and PCI are recommended in patients with cancer and ACS if cancer prognosis is ≥6 months or if they have acute complications of ACS (cardiogenic shock, pulmonary oedema,
ventricular tachyarrhythmias), where PCI offers palliation of symptoms.483
When stenting is indicated,
third-generation drug-eluting stents are preferred because of the lower risk of in-stent thrombosis. Balloon angioplasty is associated with worse outcome474 and should only be used in case of severe thrombocytopaenia or need for urgent surgery. Fractional
ﬂow reserve or instantaneous free wave ratio are advised by experts484 to avoid unnecessary interventions while intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography can be used to ensure optimal stent apposition and expansion, to avoid thrombotic complications.485
Retrospective data have demonstrated a lower use of invasive management in patients with cancer with ST-segment elevation MI
(STEMI), with a better outcome for invasively treated patients.475,480,483 PCI has not demonstrated a mortality beneﬁt in patients with advanced cancer and NSTE-ACS compared with optimal medical therapy.479 Therefore, a non-invasive approach can be attempted in low-risk (without signs or symptoms of ongoing ischaemia or haemodynamic instability) NSTE-ACS patients with poor cancer prognosis (,6 months).
Due to a potentially higher bleeding risk (especially in patients with active GI cancer),477 the preferred antithrombotic strategy after drug-eluting stent consists of DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel instead of newer P2Y12 antagonists. The duration of DAPT should be kept as short as possible (1–3 months).458 In patients with need for therapeutic anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, a NOAC and single oral antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) is the default strategy after a short period of triple antithrombotic therapy (up to 1 week in hospital).458 Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery can be considered in patients with extensive CAD who are not amenable with PCI, after MDT discussion and where cancer prognosis is
.12 months.
Thrombocytopaenia (platelet count , 100 000/µL) is present in about 10% of patients with cancer and may complicate ACS management. Based on a small series, coronary angiography can be safely performed in these patients when preventative measures to avoid bleeding are taken: platelet transfusion before catheterization (for platelets ,20 000/µL), radial access, careful haemostasis, and the use of a lower heparin dose (30–50 U/kg).486 Antiplatelets should not be withheld unless platelet count is ,10 000/µL for aspirin or
,30 000/µL for clopidogrel. For PCI and CABG, experts advise minimum platelet counts of 30 000/µL and 50 000/µL, respectively.484
In case of MI with non-obstructive coronary arteries, CMR may be considered to detect other causes of myocardial injury, especially myocarditis and TTS.
When acute ischaemia is provoked by cancer therapy, alternative cancer therapies should be considered after a MDT discussion. In the case of coronary vasospasm secondary to ﬂuoropyrimidines, and in the absence of an alternative therapy, a rechallenge, although controversial, can be considered in a monitored unit after exclusion of severe CAD (CT or coronary angiography) and after initiation of prophylactic therapy with long-acting nitrates and calcium channel blockers (CCB).487–489
Following ACS, a review of the cancer medications is recommended, and any cancer drug associated with thrombosis and MI
should be stopped. Restarting cancer drugs associated with acute thrombosis and MI after ACS (Table 7) should occur only after a
MDT to explore other cancer therapies, with appropriate patient education and consent. Cancer therapies not associated with MI
can be restarted once revascularization, where indicated, has been completed and the patient is stabilized on ACS medical therapy without complications.

6.2.2. Chronic coronary syndromes
Several cancer treatments are associated with an increased risk of stable angina and chronic coronary syndromes (CCS).491 5-FU and capecitabine can precipitate effort angina in some cases.4,482,492
Platinum-containing chemotherapy-induced ischaemia usually occurs after one of the ﬁrst three cycles and in patients with underlying
CAD.493 The incidence of cardiac ischaemia is 1–5% with antimicrotubule agents, 2–3% with small-molecule VEGF-TKI, and 0.6–1.5%
with VEGFi monoclonal antibody therapies.492 Nilotinib, ponatinib,494 and ICI335 also accelerate atherosclerosis, which can lead to stable angina.
Patients receiving cancer therapy who present with new stable angina should have careful clinical evaluation, with aggressive CVRF
modiﬁcation and an initial medical management of their symptoms.484 The diagnosis and management of CAD should follow the
The management of CCS is similar in patients with and without cancer, in accordance with guideline recommendations.100
However, in the setting of CCS, decisions regarding coronary revascularization should be undertaken by a MDT that includes cardio-oncology, intervention, and oncology specialists.5 PCI in patients with cancer is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, 90-day readmissions for acute MI, in-hospital and longterm mortality, and the need for repeat revascularization, with the magnitude of risk depending on both cancer type and stage.495,496 The excess bleeding risk should be mitigated by keeping the duration of DAPT as short as possible.497,498 The risk is higher in patients with a cancer diagnosis within the preceding year.477
6.3. Valvular heart disease
New or worsening VHD in patients with cancer may be related to coexisting conditions, including CTRCD, ACS, PH, endocarditis,
cardiac tumours, and mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis.499,500
Pre-existing severe VHD is associated with an increased risk of
CTRCD,12,501–503 and may also pose a risk for cancer surgery outcomes. In patients with mechanical prosthetic valves, the risk of thrombosis vs. bleeding should be carefully balanced during chemotherapy treatment. In patients with severe VHD diagnosed at baseline assessment, a MDT is required before cancer therapy to decide the best treatment option. Cardiac surgery is frequently challenging in patients with cancer because of comorbidities, frailty, mediastinal ﬁbrosis due to prior RT, impaired wound healing, and the need for urgent oncology treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, targeted cancer therapies that effect wound healing). Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may be a viable option for patients with cancer with severe aortic stenosis to limit recovery time and delays in starting cancer treatment.504–506
Patients with cancer suspected of new or worsening VHD, such as dyspnoea or a new cardiac murmur, or those with fever and positive blood cultures, should be screened for endocarditis and managed according to the recommendations from the 2021 ESC/European
Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) Guidelines for the management of VHD,507 while considering the cancer-related prognosis. If valve surgery or percutaneous valve treatment is indicated in a patient receiving cancer treatment, then a MDT is recommended regarding type of valve treatment and periprocedural management of cancer treatments.

6.4. Cardiac arrhythmias
6.4.1. Atrial ﬁbrillation
AF may occur in patients with cancer in different settings: it may be a marker of cancer type or occult cancer, or it may develop in patients undergoing surgery, chemotherapy, or RT.508,509 All types of cancer show an increased risk of AF compared with the control group, but the risk of AF depends on the cancer type and stage.510,511 AF during a cancer treatment may be caused by a speciﬁc therapy or interaction with a pre-existing substrate in older patients with cancer.
During cancer therapy AF may occur with a frequency ranging from 2% to 16%, according to a variety of factors,4,490,508,512–514
and may present either as ﬁrst-diagnosed AF or as recurrence of paroxysmal AF. The risk of developing AF is greater in patients older than 65 years and/or with pre-existing CVD.4,509,512,515 Cancer surgery is associated with a variable rate of AF occurrence, with the highest incidence reported for lung surgery, ranging from 6% to
32%, but with occurrence also in cases of non-thoracic surgery
(e.g. 4–5% after colectomy).509
Many anticancer drugs have been associated with an increased risk of AF both in terms of incident and recurrent AF (Supplementary data, Table S18).251 AF may occur shortly after treatment516 or weeks or months after starting treatment.517,518 The pathophysiology of AF associated with cancer is complex and has been extensively reviewed elsewhere (Figure 30).509
In patients with cancer, the occurrence of AF is associated with a two-fold higher risk of systemic thromboembolism/stroke and a sixfold increase in the risk of HF.4,509,512 The coexistence of cancer increases the risk of all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial haemorrhage in patients with AF. The association between cancer and ischaemic stroke differs between cancer types, and in some types, the risk of bleeding seems to exceed the thromboembolic risk.519 The management of AF in patients with cancer should follow the 2020 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of atrial
ﬁbrillation273 and the ‘ABC pathway’ (Atrial ﬁbrillation Better Care)
approach should be applied (A: Anticoagulation to avoid stroke/systemic embolism, B: Better symptom control with rate- and/or rhythm-control drugs and interventions, and C: Comorbidities and
CVRF management, including lifestyle changes).273,520
The acute management of AF in patients with cancer should consider electrical cardioversion in cases of haemodynamic instability,521
while in others, the alternative between rate and rhythm control has several important considerations speciﬁc to patients with cancer.
Drugs for rhythm control may lead to QT-interval prolongation,369
frequently have drug–drug interactions with cancer therapies, or may have a limited efﬁcacy if a cancer therapy is the speciﬁc cause of the AF.508 Among rate-control drugs, beta-blockers are preferred,
especially if the cancer therapies have potential CTRCD risk, whereas diltiazem and verapamil should be avoided where possible due to their drug–drug interactions and negative inotropic effects.508 The possibility of AF ablation should be discussed in selected patients with HF/LVD and/or uncontrolled symptoms, taking into consideration cancer status and prognosis in the context of a MDT
approach.522
A complex issue in patients with cancer with new AF is risk stratiﬁcation for stroke/systemic embolism, which according to guidelines,
should be based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years [2 points], Diabetes mellitus,
Stroke [2 points]—Vascular disease, Age 65–74 years, Sex category
[female]).273,523,524 The CHA2DS2-VASc score has not been extensively validated in patients with cancer.525 In a large cohort of patients with AF, the predictive value of the CHA2DS2-VASc score was lower in patients with cancer than in those without, but a progressive increase in the risk of ischaemic stroke according to the
CHA2DS2-VASc score was also found in AF patients with cancer
(from 0.9% per year to 8.9% per year).519 However, the scope of this score is not to identify high-risk patients, but rather to identify low-risk individuals in whom anticoagulation can be avoided. A study based on the Danish healthcare system data set found that
CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 0 and 1 in patients with recent cancer were linked with higher risk of stroke/thromboembolism at 2 years than in patients without recent cancer.526 This concept should be considered in deﬁning the risk/beneﬁt ratio of anticoagulation in individual patients with cancer. Therefore, the decision for anticoagulation in patients with an active malignancy should take into account the enhanced thrombotic and/or bleeding risk and other risk prediction scores used for general AF populations.509 For bleeding risk assessment, the HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal and liver function, Stroke, Bleeding Labile international normalized ratio,
Elderly, Drugs or alcohol) score may be considered. A proposed approach to anticoagulation therapy in cancer, based on the acronym T
(thrombotic risk), B (bleeding risk), I (interactions among drugs), P
(patient access and preferences), is outlined in Figure 31.519,527
Long-term anticoagulation is recommended in adult patients with
CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 in men or ≥3 in women and must be considered also when the score is 1 in men and 2 in women.273 The clinical pattern of AF (i.e. ﬁrst detected, paroxysmal, persistent,
long-standing persistent, permanent, post-operative) should not inﬂuence the indication of thromboprophylaxis.273 The same approach can be proposed for patients with cancer and AF, also considering that the CHA2DS2-VASc score likely underestimates their thromboembolic risk.530 In the speciﬁc setting of cancer, decision-making on long-term oral anticoagulation should also consider the cancerrelated type, stage, prognosis and the potentially changing thromboembolic or bleeding risk.508,509 The use of vitamin K antagonists
(VKA) in cancer is limited by their drawbacks in this setting; however,
they remain the only indicated anticoagulants in patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthetic valve.
LMWH constitute a viable short-term anticoagulation option, particularly in hospitalized patients with a recent cancer diagnosis, advanced cancer disease, or during some cancer treatments (e.g.
In patients with cancer developing new VHD
during cancer therapy, management according to the 2021 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of VHD507 is recommended, taking into consideration cancer prognosis and patient comorbidities.

patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or with recent active bleeding). However, LMWH efﬁcacy for stroke or systemic embolism prevention in AF has not been established and their use is only based on their proven efﬁcacy and safety in VTE. The use of a NOAC for AF has not been evaluated in a dedicated
RCT in patients with cancer. However, secondary analyses of seminal NOAC trials using direct factor Xa inhibitors (ROCKET AF

According to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis,529 major bleeding is deﬁned as a fall in haemoglobin level ≥2 g/dL and/or transfusion of ≥2 units of red blood cells and/or fatal bleeding and/or bleeding in a critical area (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial,
intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal). cPercutaneous left appendage closure may be considered in patients with a life expectancy of .1 year who are at high thromboembolic and bleeding risk and in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated. dConditions favouring LMWH: unoperated GI/GU cancer; GI comorbidities or toxicity; severe renal dysfunction (CrCl , 15 mL/min); NOAC major drug–drug interactions, platelet count ,50 000/µL.

complications related to the implant—including device-related thrombosis—and the lack of prospective data in the setting of patients with cancer have to be taken into consideration for this option. In a recent retrospective analysis of patients referred to LAA occlusion the risk of in-hospital ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack was higher in patients with active cancer than in those with no cancer or prior history of cancer. The rate of in-hospital composite outcome (in-hospital death, ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack, systemic embolism,
bleeding requiring blood transfusion, pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade treated with pericardiocentesis or surgically, and removal of embolized device) and 30-day/180-day readmission outcomes were not signiﬁcantly different between the groups.539
The onset of AF may be related to transient factors, such as the peri-operative period or the effect of drugs known to facilitate AF
onset. The traditional assumption that in these cases, AF may occur as an isolated event without recurrence may not be valid as the occurrence of AF may often be related to a pre-existing atrial substrate with vulnerability to AF.540 Post-operative AF has been associated with a four- to ﬁve-fold risk of AF recurrence in the following 5 years,
along with a comparable long-term thromboembolic risk with AF not related to surgery.273,540,541 Anticoagulation therapy yielded a similarly lower risk of thromboembolic events and all-cause death in both groups.541 In the absence of direct evidence, anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events should be considered in patients at risk for stroke with AF after cancer surgery considering the anticipated net clinical beneﬁt and informed patient preferences.273
Similarly, in patients with AF apparently related to transient factors
—such as chemotherapy, other drugs, or electrolyte disturbances
—a careful clinical assessment of the propensity to further develop
AF is recommended, with need to revisit the risk/beneﬁt ratio of long-term prescription of anticoagulation after a period of 3 months.
In patients with cancer and newly detected or recurrence of AF, decision making on anticancer treatment requires a cardio-oncology MDT
management,5 taking into account that neither the presence nor the risk of AF constitutes contraindications to anticancer treatment.508,517

6.4.2. Long corrected QT interval and ventricular arrhythmias
VA are not common during cancer, although their incidence increases in patients with advanced cancer and CV comorbidities.49,259,516,542
Mechanisms proposed to explain cancer therapy-induced VA include: (1) direct effects of cancer drugs on the activity/expression of ionic channels that regulate the ventricular action potential,4,369,442,516,542,543 and (2) a permanent arrhythmogenic substrate created by cancer and systemic inﬂammation caused by cancer,

Symptomatic VA require cancer drug dose reduction or discontinuation and patients should be referred to the cardiologist for evaluation and treatment.4,442
Recurrent symptomatic life-threatening VA require urgent intervention.4,270,442,544 The administration of class IA, IC, and III antiarrhythmic drugs is limited by the risk of drug–drug interactions and QTc prolongation. Beta-blockers and class IB drugs are less likely to cause drug interactions or QTc prolongation. Beta-blockers are the preferred choice if the cancer drug is also associated with
CTRCD. Amiodarone is the antiarrhythmic drug of choice in patients with structural heart disease and haemodynamic instability.

Decisions on the use of antiarrhythmic drugs or device therapy (cardioverter deﬁbrillators, catheter ablation) should consider life expectancy, quality of life, and complication risks.349
Most cancer therapy-induced VA are related to a prolongation of
QTc leading to the development of TdP.259,516,542 Risk factors for
QTc prolongation and TdP are summarized in Table 8.4,22,45,48,516,543
The upper 99% limits of normal for QTc values in the general population are 450 ms for men and 460 ms for women.545
Although there is no threshold of QTc prolongation at which TdP
can occur, a QTc ≥500 ms is associated with a two- to three-fold higher risk for TdP, while TdP rarely occurs when QTc is
,500 ms.442
Although the incidence of
QTc prolongation
≥500 ms and TdP is low during cancer therapy, QTc prolongation to levels that require closer monitoring (QTc ≥480 ms) is more common (Table 9).4,9,22,45,48,49,259,369,516,543,546 Changes in the QT
interval of .60 ms from baseline should not routinely affect treatment decisions if the QTc remains ,500 ms.1 Cardiology consultation is advised in patients with an abnormal baseline QTc interval,
patients treated with drugs that prolong the QT interval, those who develop new cardiac symptoms (syncope or pre-syncope, rapid palpitations or QTc prolongation with new-onset bradycardia, high degree of heart block), and/or those with known inherited arrhythmia

disorders.4,45,48,442,544 The challenges for the cardio-oncology teams are to identify patients more susceptible to developing VA, determine whether a VA is directly due to CTR-CVT, individualize the treatment strategy, and optimize clinical monitoring during treatment.
Figure 32 shows the algorithm for the management of QTc prolongation during cancer therapy. In patients with cancer, the
Fridericia formula is recommended and has demonstrated less error than other correction methods such as Bazzett at both high and low heart rates.44 In patients treated with QTc-prolonging drugs, serum electrolytes and other risk factors should be closely monitored and corrected, and concomitant QT-prolonging drugs avoided if possible.4,22,45,369,543 For selected cancer drugs, there are speciﬁc manufacturer recommendations for ECG monitoring during treatment,
dosage adjustments, or discontinuation of therapy in case of QTc prolongation.548
Although there are no recommendations, patients with cancer with QTc prolongation associated with severe bradycardia or sinus pauses may beneﬁt from isoprenaline infusion or temporary pacing. Despite present restrictions, the improved prognosis for many malignancies is increasing the number of patients with cancer who are candidates for an implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator
(ICD), particularly when life expectancy is .1 year (including patients who experienced resuscitated sudden cardiac death or severe VA from a QTc-prolonging drug with no alternative treatment available).
6.4.3. Bradyarrhythmias
AV conduction disease can be caused by ICI in the presence or absence of myocarditis. If the PR interval increases (new ﬁrst-degree heart block) in patients treated with ICI, serial ECG monitoring is recommended, and if PR prolongation to .300 ms develops, the patient should be hospitalized under close ECG monitoring and i.v.
methylprednisolone is recommended.550
IMiD (thalidomide, pomalidomide)285 and ALK inhibitors (crizotinib, alectinib, brigatinib, or ceritinib)551 are associated with sinus bradycardia. Holter ECG monitoring is recommended to exclude signiﬁcant sinus pauses in symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients with normal LV function, sinus bradycardia is usually well tolerated and treatment can continue. If patients are symptomatic
(syncope, pre-syncope of reduced exercise tolerance from chronotropic incompetence) then a trial of cancer drug withdrawal to conﬁrm causation with the symptoms is recommended. A MDT
discussion is needed to analyse risks/beneﬁts of alternative cancer therapies vs. restarting the culprit cancer therapy at a lower dose with heart rate monitoring. In selected cases, when no cancer treatment alternative is available, pacing is indicated.
6.5. Arterial hypertension
Arterial hypertension in patients with cancer may be caused by their cancer treatments (e.g. VEGFi, second- and third-generation
BCR-ABL TKI, brigatinib, ibrutinib, ﬂuoropyrimidines, cisplatin, abiraterone, bicalutamide, enzalutamide), non-cancer drugs (e.g. corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs), and other factors including stress, pain, excessive alcohol consumption, renal impairment, untreated sleep apnoea, obesity, and reduced exercise.552 In all patients with cancer with new hypertension assessment,
correction of these other factors is important before considering interruption of a cancer treatment.
Untreated hypertension344 is a conﬁrmed risk factor of HF during treatment with anthracyclines,553 ibrutinib,264 and VEGFi.554 Given that many of the cancer therapies that cause hypertension also cause

CTRCD, treatment of hypertension with ACE-I or ARB as ﬁrst-line therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of
CTRCD.
Combination therapy with an ACE-I or ARB and a dihydropyridine
CCB is recommended in patients with cancer with systolic BP ≥
160 mmHg and diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg due to the more rapid onset of BP control with the combination compared with ACE-I/ARB
monotherapy (Figures 33 and 34).
If severe hypertension is diagnosed (systolic BP ≥180 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg), the competing cancer and CV risks should be evaluated by a MDT, and any cancer therapy associated with hypertension should be deferred or temporarily withheld until the BP is controlled to values ,160 mmHg (systolic BP) and
,100 mmHg (diastolic BP). Culprit cancer therapy can be restarted once BP is controlled, with consideration for dose reduction.
In patients with resistant cancer therapy-related hypertension,
spironolactone, oral or transdermal nitrates, and/or hydralazine should be considered. In patients with cancer with evidence of high sympathetic tone, stress, and/or pain, beta-blockers including carvedilol or nebivolol should be considered. Diuretics, preferably spironolactone, may be considered in patients with cancer with hypertension and evidence of increased ﬂuid retention, with monitoring of BP, electrolytes, and renal function.

6.6. Thrombosis and thromboembolic events
Thromboembolic events that develop during cancer and its treatment encompass both VTE and arterial thromboembolism (ATE)
and are collectively referred to as cancer-associated thrombosis.
Cancer-associated thrombosis is determined by the prothrombotic milieu induced by cancer, the prothrombotic properties of certain anticancer and adjunctive therapies, and patient-related risk factors,
including demographics,
genetic predisposition,
and comorbidities.513
6.6.1. Venous thromboembolism
VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE, is the second-leading cause of death in patients with malignancies.558
Cancer confers a ﬁve-fold higher risk of VTE and cancer-associated
VTE represents 30% of all VTE cases.559,560 The risk of VTE varies in the course of cancer, with the highest risk occurring in the period following cancer diagnosis, during hospitalization and chemotherapy,
and upon development of metastatic disease.561,562 Unprovoked
VTE may be the ﬁrst clinical sign of a malignancy, followed by a 5%
incidence of cancer diagnosis during the subsequent 12 months.563
The risk factors for VTE in cancer are summarized in
Figure 35.564,565 Patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of
VTE, such as unilateral lower limb oedema or unexplained dyspnoea,
should be screened with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography or contrast-enhanced CT for DVT and CT pulmonary angiography for PE, according to the 2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism recommendations566

and the second consensus document on diagnosis and management of acute deep vein thrombosis.567
6.6.2. Arterial thromboembolism
Cancer carries a two-fold higher risk of ATE, including MI and ischaemic stroke.568 ATE risk is higher in men, with advanced age, and in patients with lung or kidney cancer. Pathologies related to ATE in cancer include ischaemic stroke induced by AF or RT-induced carotid artery disease, embolization by tumour cells or non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, disseminated intravascular coagulationrelated peripheral microcirculatory thromboembolism, paradoxical cerebral embolism in the course of VTE, and cerebral sinus thrombosis.569
6.6.3. Intracardiac thrombosis
Intracardiac thrombus in patients with malignancies may result from the prothrombotic properties of cancer and its treatment and the use of central venous catheters. Thrombus is the most common intracardiac mass and it can occur within any cardiac chamber. Right atrial thrombi are often related to a venous catheter where the line has inappropriately advanced into the right atrium.
Intraventricular thrombi usually occur in the setting of CTRCD.
LAA thrombi are most commonly associated with AF, which may also be related to cancer or its therapy.
Patients with systemic embolization should be screened for cardiac origin of thrombus initially with TTE and/or transoesophageal echocardiography.528 CMR is more sensitive and speciﬁc than TTE

(LGE) CMR with the long inversion time technique is currently considered the gold standard.570,571
6.6.4. Anticoagulation therapy
Patients with cancer frequently have both an increased thrombotic risk and an increased bleeding risk associated with certain cancer locations
(e.g. GI, intracranial), thrombocytopaenia, and other coagulation defects (secondary to bone marrow invasion, cancer therapies, or cancer itself) and associated comorbidities (e.g. renal or hepatic dysfunction,
GI toxicities). Several anticancer agents are further characterized by drug–drug interactions with anticoagulants. All these factors may render anticoagulation in cancer quite challenging. A proposed approach to anticoagulation therapy in cancer-associated venous thrombosis,
based on the TBIP acronym (Thromboembolic risk, Bleeding risk,
drug–drug Interactions, Patient preferences), is outlined in Figure 36.527
6.6.4.1. Treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism
Several large RCTs and meta-analyses have shown that LMWH decrease the risk of recurrent VTE by 40% compared to VKA, with a similar risk of major bleeding.572–576 However, VKA are characterized by an unpredictable anticoagulation effect and low time in therapeutic range in patients with malignancies due to multiple drug–drug interactions, GI toxicity, malnutrition, and liver dysfunction.577
NOAC have been assessed as potential alternatives to LMWH for cancer-associated VTE, based on RCTs that compared edoxaban, rivaroxaban or apixaban to dalteparin.578–583 The totality of evidence derived by these trials and subsequent meta-analyses584–586 shows that
NOAC are non-inferior to dalteparin in reducing the risk of VTE recurrence. The risk of major bleeding was similar, although NOAC were associated with an increased risk of clinically relevant non-major bleeding,
particularly in patients with luminal GI and GU malignancies.586 As a result, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are recommended for the treatment of VTE (DVT and PE) in patients with cancer without any of the following bleeding risk factors: unoperated GI or GU malignancies, history of recent bleeding or within 7 days of major surgery, signiﬁcant thrombocytopaenia (platelet count, 50000/µL), severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance (CrCl, 15 mL/min), or GI comorbidities.582,586 In addition, drug–drug interactions between NOAC, cancer therapies, and other concomitant treatments should be checked.587
There are also concerns about NOAC in patients with GI toxicity such as vomiting or those having undergone gastrectomy or extensive intestine resection, as well as those with severely impaired renal function. Shared decision-making considering informed patient preferences should guide the choice of anticoagulation.
Incidentally encountered proximal DVT or PE should be treated in the same manner as symptomatic VTE as they bear similar rates of recurrence and mortality.588
The minimal duration of anticoagulation is 6 months and extended anticoagulation is suggested in the presence of active malignancy,
metastatic disease, or chemotherapy use. Cohort studies have shown that extended LMWH therapy beyond 6 and up to 12 months is safe in cancer-associated VTE.589,590 However, patients with cancer are also at high risk of bleeding during anticoagulant treatment and a periodic assessment of the risk/beneﬁt ratio should performed.
In VTE relapse under anticoagulation, the patient should be investigated for treatment adherence, cancer progression or relapse, while a different anticoagulation strategy should be endorsed (e.g. replacement of NOAC with LMWH). The management of patients with VTE and a platelet count ,25000/µL should be individualized by a MDT.299
The duration of anticoagulation in patients with catheterassociated thrombosis depends upon whether the catheter is removed or remains in situ. If removed, then anticoagulation should continue for a minimum of 3 months and until follow-up cardiac imaging conﬁrms resolution of the thrombus. If the catheter remains in situ, then long-term therapeutic anticoagulation should continue.
6.6.4.2. Primary prevention of venous thromboembolism

Cancer) II study showed favourable outcomes with LMWH as primary thromboprophylaxis for 4 weeks after major abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery.595 For ambulatory patients, VTE risk should be individually determined and proposed scores such as the Khorana or the COMPASS-CAT (prospective COmparison of Methods for thromboembolic risk assessment with clinical Perceptions and
AwareneSS in real-life patients—Cancer Associated Thrombosis)
score may be useful.596,597 Further trials and a meta-analysis have shown that LMWH signiﬁcantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic
VTE in ambulatory patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy with acceptable safety.598–600
Two randomized,
placebo-controlled,
double-blind clinical trials have assessed the role of NOAC in primary prevention of VTE in high-risk ambulatory patients receiving systemic cancer therapy (Khorana score ≥2).601,602 Over a follow-up period of
180 days, apixaban (2.5 mg twice a day)601 therapy resulted in a signiﬁcantly lower rate of VTE, although the rate of major bleeding episodes was higher than with placebo. Rivaroxaban (10 mg once a day)602
treatment resulted in a non-signiﬁcantly lower incidence of VTE or death due to VTE with low bleeding risk (no signiﬁcant differences with placebo). Further data on the use of NOAC in this setting are warranted. Consideration of such therapy should be accompanied by a discussion with the patient about the relative beneﬁts and harms,
cancer prognosis, drug cost, and duration of prophylaxis.
6.7. Bleeding complications
Bleeding complications are more common in patients with cancer than in patients without cancer. This may be directly related to the tumour itself,
or indirectly related to chemotherapyor
RT-induced weakening of mucosal barriers.530
6.7.1. High-risk patients
GI and GU cancers are associated with a signiﬁcant excess bleeding risk compared with other solid tumours.603 Thrombocytopaenia and platelet dysfunction due to haematological malignancies or bone marrow suppression can exacerbate bleeding. Other bleeding risk factors include advancing age, renal or hepatic impairment, metastatic disease, low body mass index, and treatment with ibrutinib, VEGFi, cetuximab, or bevacizumab.578,603–605
Gastric protection with routine proton pump inhibitor use should be considered in all patients with cancer on DAPT606,607
or anticoagulation.530
6.7.2. Antiplatelet therapy
Antiplatelet therapy, in particular DAPT, increases the risk of bleeding in patients with cancer.477 Following ACS and/or PCI, the risk of bleeding is approximately 1.6-fold greater in patients with cancer than in those without.477,605 The risk is greatest in those diagnosed with cancer in the preceding year, whereas more remote cancers carry lower excess risk.477 The PRECISE-DAPT (PREdicting bleeding
Complications In patients undergoing Stent implantation and subsEquent Dual Anti Platelet Therapy) score appears not to perform well for predicting bleeding in patients with cancer.477 In order to reduce bleeding risk, the duration and intensity of DAPT should be minimized477,607 and triple therapy avoided whenever possible. At the same time, DAPT—if indicated—should not be withheld without good reason. A recent expert consensus statement suggests reduced platelet count thresholds for CV therapies, recommending aspirin initiation for platelet counts .10 000/µL and DAPT initiation (with aspirin and clopidogrel) for platelet counts .30 000/µL.608 In patients with platelet counts ,50 000/µL, clopidogrel is preferred over prasugrel or ticagrelor, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors should be avoided.608 To reduce peri-procedural bleeding, PCI
should preferably be undertaken via the radial approach484 and prophylactic platelet transfusion may be considered for patients with platelet count ,20 000/µL.609
6.7.3. Management of bleeding
Basic principles of bleeding management should be followed with control of the bleeding source whenever possible. Platelet transfusions for signiﬁcant thrombocytopaenia and withholding and reversal of anticoagulation for life-threatening bleeding may be needed as in the general population.530,610 Antiﬁbrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid or e-aminocaproic acid, can be considered. Non-speciﬁc support of haemostasis using coagulation factor concentrates and speciﬁc reversal agents may be needed for patients on a NOAC
with life-threatening bleeding.530 Recombinant activated factor VII
or activated prothrombin complex concentrates should be avoided in patients with recent thrombosis.

6.8. Peripheral artery disease
There is growing evidence that cancer therapy affects the vasculature. A recent meta-analysis showed a signiﬁcantly increased arterial stiffness after anthracycline and non-anthracycline treatment.611
Paraneoplastic acral vascular syndrome was described after initiation of nivolumab, with ﬁrst symptoms 3 weeks after initiation of therapy.612 Raynaud phenomenon has been associated with the use of bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids,
and ﬂuoropyrimidines.491 Usual treatment of Raynaud’s includes non-pharmacological measures to help prevent an episode (avoidance of provoking factors such as cold temperature, vasoconstricting drugs)
and a
long-acting dihydropyridine
CCB
(amlodipine,
modiﬁed-release nifedipine).
Treatment with nilotinib or ponatinib may be associated with an increased risk of vascular adverse events, including arterial stiffness and PAD development.494 In a subgroup of patients, these events are severe or even life-threatening.613 Although the exact mechanisms remain unknown, we recommend screening for pre-existing
PAD and for vascular risk factors such as DM in all patients before and during nilotinib or ponatinib therapy. Pooled data from three clinical trials showed arterial occlusive disease to be related to dose intensity in ponatinib-treated patients,614 but PAD was not addressed separately. If rapidly progressive PAD occurs with secondgeneration TKI, it may be advisable to switch to an alternative lowerrisk TKI (e.g. imatinib). Platelet aggregation inhibitors or anticoagulation and statins should be considered. Despite lack of evidence, all risk factors should be corrected.615
6.9. Pulmonary hypertension
All ﬁve groups of the PH classiﬁcation can be observed in patients with cancer. Several cancer drugs can cause group 1 PH (pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]), including carﬁlzomib, bosutinib, dasatinib,616 ponatinib, interferon alpha, and alkylating agents (e.g. mitomycin C and cyclophosphamide, which mostly cause pulmonary veno-occlusive disease).617 PH associated with left heart disease
(group 2) is related to drugs causing HF (e.g. anthracyclines). PH associated with lung disease (group 3) is related to drugs and therapies causing pulmonary ﬁbrosis (e.g. bleomycin, thoracic radiation). The most common pulmonary vascular disease complicating cancer is
VTE, which can cause chronic thromboembolic PH (group 4). Of note, central venous catheters are important causes of group 4 PH
complicating cancer management. Other group 4 PH due to pulmonary artery obstructions includes angiosarcoma and other malignant tumours (e.g. renal carcinoma, uterine carcinoma, germ cell tumours of the testis).618
PH with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (group 5) includes several conditions that may be complicated by complex and sometimes overlapping pulmonary vascular involvement. Tumoral
PH includes pulmonary tumour micro-embolism and pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy.619 Multiple causes of PH have been described in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders.
In chronic myelogenous leukaemia, spleen enlargement and anaemia can give rise to hyperkinetic syndrome. In polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, there is an increased risk of VTE and chronic thromboembolic PH. Moreover, formation of a blood clot within the hepatic veins can lead to Budd–Chiari syndrome and subsequent porto-PH. Pulmonary extramedullary haematopoiesis complicating idiopathic or secondary myeloﬁbrosis may also contribute to dyspnoea and PH.620
Symptoms of PH are non-speciﬁc, such as shortness of breath and fatigue. In later stages, symptoms of right-sided HF may develop. An
ECG should be performed and examined for RV hypertrophy, but a normal ECG does not exclude PH. Echocardiography is the ﬁrst choice for assessing PH probability in patients who develop symptoms and/or signs suggestive of PH during cancer treatment.
When peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) is ≤2.8 m/s
(equating to an estimated systolic PAP [sPAP] of ≤35 mmHg)
and no other signs of PH are present, then the probability of PH
is low. In the absence of a tricuspid regurgitant jet, other echocardiography signs may increase suspicion of PH (e.g. RV/LV basal diameter ratio . 1, RV outﬂow tract acceleration time , 105 ms,
inferior vena cava diameter . 21 mm with decreased inspiratory collapse).620 Baseline TTE should be considered in patients receiving cancer drugs that can cause PH; however, a right-heart catheterization is required for deﬁnitive diagnosis of PH and to support
PAH treatment decisions. In the DASISION (DASatinib vs. Imatinib
Study In treatment-Naïve chronic myeloid leukemia patients) trial,
5% of patients randomized to dasatinib were diagnosed with
PH, compared with 0.4% of those randomized to imatinib.621 In patients who develop PH, dasatinib treatment should be interrupted and an alternative TKI should be used.616
Overall management of PH in oncology patients should be based on the 2022 ESC/European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension.620 Referral to a PH centre is recommended for multidisciplinary management with the oncology team. In patients with CML treated with drugs causing PH-induced PAH, discontinuation of the potential culprit therapy is recommended if there is a high probability of new PH
(peak
TRV . 3.4 m/s,
equating to an estimated sPAP
of
≥50 mmHg) until the diagnosis is conﬁrmed or ruled out by a rightheart catheterization. In CML patients on dasatinib, an alternative
BCR-ABL TKI is recommended if they develop symptomatic PAH
or an asymptomatic increase in peak TRV .3.4 m/s. Dasatinib dose reduction and close monitoring of peak TRV with TTE every
4 weeks should be considered in CML patients who develop new asymptomatic peak TRV ranging from 2.9 to 3.4 m/s.620 If peak
TRV remains normal or mildly elevated on serial monitoring, then dasatinib can continue, with reduced TTE monitoring to every 3

months. If peak TRV continues to rise, then right-heart catheterization should be performed, dasatinib treatment should be stopped,
and PAH drugs should be considered if PAH is conﬁrmed.
6.10. Pericardial diseases
Pericarditis and pericardial effusion can be related to a wide range of cancer treatments including chest radiation, cytotoxic therapies (anthracyclines, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine), targeted therapies (all-trans retinoic acid, arsenic trioxide, dasatinib), and immune-based therapies (interleukin-2, interferon-αICI). A combination of therapies may have a synergistic effect on the pericardium.
These therapy-induced complications must be differentiated from progressive cancer (local invasion, metastatic involvement, or mediastinal lymphatic drainage obstruction) and non-cancer-related causes such as infection, especially in immune-compromised patients.622 A
careful history and clinical examination are of help to determine the cause. TTE plays a central role in diagnosis and management. CT
and CMR can provide additional information on pericardial inﬂammation and constrictive physiology. The principles for the diagnosis and management should follow the 2015 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases,444 but there are some speciﬁc issues to consider in patients with cancer.482
6.10.1. Pericarditis
The diagnosis of pericarditis in patients with cancer follows the same principles as in those without, but symptoms can be atypical.444
Acute pericarditis caused by radiation has become rare due to lower doses and improved radiation techniques. It occurs within days to weeks after treatment and is usually self-limiting, but can evolve towards constrictive pericarditis many years later (Section 8.6).
Pericarditis caused by conventional cancer therapies often resolves with standard therapy or after discontinuation of the treatment.444
Cancer treatment interruption should be discussed with the cardio-oncology team. Treatment with anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(e.g. ibuprofen) and colchicine, in the absence of contraindications,
is recommended as it reduces the rate of recurrence requiring repeat intervention.623 Low-to-moderate doses of steroids are only indicated for resistant cases except ICI-related pericarditis.444
ICI-associated pericarditis has a median time of onset of 30 days in retrospective surveillance studies and is associated with a poor prognosis, especially in case of concomitant myocarditis.444,624
In patients with severe ICI-associated pericarditis with moderate or severe effusion, ICI discontinuation and high-dose steroids (methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day) with or without colchicine are recommended, as well as pericardiocentesis in case of cardiac tamponade.624,625 In case of refractory pericarditis, immunosuppressive drugs should be considered.
For uncomplicated ICI-related pericarditis, the ICI might be continued and colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs could be considered.326,444 For patients requiring ICI discontinuation, restarting ICI
can be considered in a MDT discussion after resolution of pericardial disease and under close monitoring.
6.10.2. Pericardial effusion
Pericardial effusions are often observed as an incidental ﬁnding in patients with cancer. Cancer therapy is the cause of a pericardial effusion in ,30% of cases, although this may increase with the expanding use of ICI in cancer. Malignancy-related pericardial effusions caused by direct (lung, oesophageal, breast) or metastatic invasion (haematological malignancies, ovarian, melanoma) or by lymph node obstruction are generally associated with poor prognosis.
Clinical presentation depends on the size of the effusion and the speed of its growth.444 Malignancy-related pericardial effusions make up .30% of patients presenting with cardiac tamponade626
and usually develop slowly, resulting in larger pericardial effusions at the time of diagnosis compared with non-malignant pericardial effusions. Management consists of determination of the cause and evaluation of the haemodynamic impact. Small-to-medium-sized effusions (.4 and ,20 mm) can be monitored with a reassessment
7–14 days after initial diagnosis and at further 4–6-weekly intervals.444,627 In unstable patients with signs of tamponade, immediate echocardiographic-guided percutaneous pericardiocentesis is preferred over surgical pericardiotomy to minimize potential complications.628 In patients with cardiac tamponade due to malignant pericardial effusions, colchicine may be useful to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the rate of repeat intervention.623 Drainage of a pericardial effusion related to ICI is rarely required629 and corticosteroids should be considered.630 Intrapericardial instillation of cytostatic/sclerosing agents,
colchicine,623
and radiation for radiation-sensitive tumours can reduce recurrence after drainage.
The creation of a pleuropericardial or pleuroperitoneal window with balloon pericardiotomy or surgery should be considered in case of recurrent malignant pericardial effusions after emergency pericardiocentesis.444
A surgical pericardial window should be considered if the percutaneous approach is not feasible and in stable patients with large
(≥20 mm) or rapidly expanding malignant pericardial effusions prior to the development of cardiac tamponade.

### 7 End-of-cancer therapy cardiovascular risk assessment

7.1. Cardiovascular evaluation during the
ﬁrst year after cardiotoxic anticancer therapy
End-of-cancer therapy CV risk assessment covers the ﬁrst 12
months after the last cardiotoxic cancer treatment. These recommendations are where cardiotoxic cancer therapy has been successfully completed with good long-term prognosis.
These recommendations are not indicated when cancer therapies are discontinued due to cancer progression and prognosis is poor, or where end-of-life care is indicated. Selected patients with cancer continue on long-term oncology therapies, e.g. women with oestrogen receptor-positive early invasive BC. In this example, the end-of-therapy risk assessment refers to the timepoint from the last anthracycline or trastuzumab dose.
High-risk patients can be identiﬁed at completion of their cardiotoxic cancer therapies by their clinical characteristics, history of
CTR-CVT during treatment, and by elevated cardiac biomarkers and/or abnormal CV imaging at follow up.53,54,92 Cardiac serum biomarkers (NP and cTn) are useful given their high negative predictive value for future CV events.197,631 In a prospective study of 2625 adult patients with cancer that assessed LVEF after anthracycline-based chemotherapy, the overall incidence of CTRCD was 9%; 98% of cases could be detected within 12 months after chemotherapy and the median time from chemotherapy to CTRCD detection was
3.5 months (interquartile range 3–6 months).208 The response to
ACE-I treatment declined when the interval between the end of chemotherapy and CTRCD detection lengthened; complete LVEF
recovery was not observed in patients where treatment was delayed by .6 months.425
Measurement of cTn after completion of anthracycline chemotherapy during the end-of-treatment assessment should be considered. Rises in cTnI after anthracycline chemotherapy identify patients at risk of future cardiac dysfunction who then beneﬁt from CV protection.4 Educating patients with cancer of their potential increased CVD risk and supporting them to make appropriate healthy lifestyle choices is recommended. CS should also be advised to promptly report early signs and symptoms of possible CVD and inform medical teams of their previous cardiotoxic cancer therapies.
CVRF including hypertension, DM, and dyslipidaemia correlate with the probability of future CV events in CS and should be well controlled after completion of cancer therapy.31,632,633
7.2. Which cancer survivors require cardiovascular surveillance in the ﬁrst year after cancer treatment?
The end-of-treatment risk assessment ideally identiﬁes those high-risk
CS, who require long-term CV surveillance, based on the following criteria (Table 10):
(1) Baseline high or very high risk based on HFA-ICOS risk assessment tools12 (Section 4).
(2) Cardiotoxic cancer therapy with a high risk of long-term CV
complications7,21 (Section 8).
(3) Moderate or severe CTR-CVT diagnosed during cancer treatment (Table 3).68
(4) New abnormalities in cardiac function detected by echocardiography, new elevated cardiac serum biomarkers, or newly CV
symptoms detected at the end-of-therapy assessment (3 or 12
months after treatment).68,208
The timing of the ﬁrst CV assessment after cardiotoxic cancer treatment depends on the risk deﬁned by baseline CV assessment,
the type of cancer therapy, and whether CTR-CVT was diagnosed during treatment.
In asymptomatic high-risk patients (Table 10), echocardiography and cardiac serum biomarkers are recommended at 3 and 12 months after completion of cancer therapy.53,54,59,61,68,148,208,425

asymptomatic moderate-risk patients (according to CV toxicity baseline risk stratiﬁcation), echocardiography and cardiac serum biomarkers should be considered within 12 months after completion of cancer therapy.53,54,59,61,68,148,208 In asymptomatic low-risk patients
(according to CV toxicity baseline risk stratiﬁcation), echocardiography and cardiac serum biomarkers may be considered within 12
months after completion of cancer therapy.634
All patients started on CV therapies (ACE-I/ARB/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, antihypertensive medications, antiarrhythmic medications, antiplatelet therapies, statins) for any CTR-CVT (especially CTRCD) should have a clinical assessment, ECG, echocardiography, and cardiac serum biomarkers (if LV systolic dysfunction/HF is a potential risk) at 3,
6, and 12 months after completing cancer treatment. A MDT-based approach to palliative and end-of-life care for patients with cancer with HF or other CTR-CVT should be focused on symptom relief according to general ESC Guidelines.
7.3. Management of cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction at the end-of-therapy assessment
During this end-of-treatment assessment, a review of cardioprotective medications initiated during cancer therapy to treat CTRCD is recommended (Figure 37). In selected patients with asymptomatic mild or moderate CTRCD who have fully recovered with normal
TTE and cardiac serum biomarkers, a trial of weaning off CV
medication should be considered after MDT discussion. This is most common after asymptomatic mild or moderate CTRCD secondary to trastuzumab, particularly in younger otherwise healthy
HER2+ BC survivors with no exposure to anthracycline chemotherapy. Further assessment of cardiac function with TTE and cardiac serum biomarkers is recommended following withdrawal of CV
medication in patients with previous CTRCD to ensure cardiac function remains normal.
Continuing long-term CV medication is generally recommended in patients with moderate and severe symptomatic or severe asymptomatic CTRCD due to the high rate of recurrent HF. Long-term treatment is also recommended in CS with mild or moderate
CTRCD who fail to recover normal LV function at their end-of-therapy assessment (Figure 37).
7.4. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and ﬁtness during the end-of-therapy assessment
CRF impairment is a strong predictor of patient outcome following cancer treatment and an intervention target in CS. Low CRF is associated with poor quality of life, increased morbidity, reduced exercise cardiac function and worse CVD risk proﬁle, and is a robust independent predictor of all-cause, cancer-related, and CVD-related mortality in CS.119,120 Recent evidence suggests the risk of
CVD-related mortality in CS decreases by 14% per 1 metabolic equivalent (3.5 mL O2/kg/min) increase in CRF.120
CPET may be considered for CS with exertional limitation, who may have substantial beneﬁt from cardiac rehabilitation. Eligible patients include those treated with higher doses of anthracycline chemotherapy and/or RT to a volume including the heart, high CV
toxicity risk at baseline, patients who developed CTRCD during cancer therapy, and those identiﬁed with new abnormalities in LV function at their end-of-therapy assessment.11 CPET can be an objective tool in the diagnosis of decreased physical capacity and identify CV vs.
non-CV causes.635
7.5. The role of cardiac rehabilitation
Exercise is a potent multitargeted therapy that prevents and treats multiple competing mechanisms of CTR-CVT in CS, including CRF impairment,636 CV injury, and pre-existing and new
CVRF.137 Prescribing exercise facilitates the delivery of therapeutic exercise that is individualized to a person’s ﬁtness level and systematically progressed to optimize physiological adaptation.637
Current evidence demonstrates that supervised exercise therapy
(including high-intensity interval training [HIIT]) is safe and well tolerated,638 attenuates CTR-CVT risk, and improves CRF.
Furthermore, HIIT reduces CVRF460 and CV risk639 in patients

### 8 Long-term follow-up and chronic cardiovascular complications in cancer survivors

8.1. Cancer survivors
8.1.1. Adult survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer
The survival of children and adolescents with cancer has increased considerably in recent decades, with 5-year survival rates currently exceeding 80%.647 However, the long-term health effects in the growing population of childhood and adolescent CS are a major concern.648 CTR-CVT, as a consequence of treatment with anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, and/or chest-directed RT can manifest as
CTRCD but also as VHD, CAD, arrhythmias, autonomic dysfunction, pericardial disease, and premature CV mortality, depending on the type of cardiotoxic treatment.643,649
CTRCD is one of the most frequent late effects in childhood CS
who received cardiotoxic cancer treatment and contributes to signiﬁcant morbidity and non-cancer-related mortality later in life.650
The cumulative incidence of CTRCD varies depending on the diagnostic criteria applied and the population studied and ranges from
4.8% to 10.6% at 40–45 years of age.651 RT to a ﬁeld involving the heart increases the risk of CTRCD and valvular and vascular complications.652
Follow-up of paediatric CS according to the International Late
Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group is recommended.653 This includes risk stratiﬁcation based upon the total cumulative dose of anthracycline chemotherapy and MHD delivered
(Table 11). Annual review of CVRF and education to promote a healthy lifestyle is recommended. The frequency of CV review with TTE depends upon risk. A CV review should be considered every 5 years for moderate-risk childhood and adolescent adult CS
and every 2 years for high-risk childhood and adolescent adult CS.
A recent retrospective analysis has shown that quantiﬁcation of
LVEF .5 years after cancer diagnosis improves long-term childhood

CS risk stratiﬁcation. A LVEF of 40–49% is associated with an almost eight-fold increased risk for LVEF ,40% at 10-year follow-up compared with patients with a preserved LVEF (≥50%).654 Lifelong surveillance for high-risk survivors is recommended.7
8.1.2. Adult cancer survivors
Long-term cancer survivorship care is an advancing ﬁeld of research.
Many survivors will experience several cancer- and treatment-related late effects throughout their lives, including CTR-CVT. Besides affecting their physical and psychosocial health status, these might reduce life expectancy and quality of life. This is relevant in some cancer types,
when CVD risk—especially CTRCD risk—exceeds cancer mortality.658,659 The risk of fatal heart disease is increased more than twofold in survivors of several solid cancers and lymphoma compared with the general population.660–662
CV risk assessment at the end of therapy (Section 7) identiﬁes CS
who require long-term cardiology follow-up beyond the ﬁrst 12
months after completing their cancer treatment. Asymptomatic
CS with new or persisting abnormalities at their end-of-therapy assessment will be identiﬁed as at high risk for future CV events and require long-term surveillance.
Speciﬁc cancer treatments carry the highest risk of long-term CV
toxicity including anthracycline chemotherapy and RT where the heart is within the RT treatment volume. Progressive RT-related
CV toxicity typically develops 5–10 years after the initial treatment,
and may cause CAD and HF at an incidence up to six-fold higher than in the general population. An increased CV mortality compared with the general population has been attributed to radiation-associated heart disease in Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, BC,
and patients with lung cancer.663–665 The incidence and progression of the radiation-related CV complications depends on the dose to the CV tissue and on concomitant cancer therapies and patient characteristics, such as pre-existing CVD, CVRF, and age.389,400
Late CV complications are also observed in CS who required HSCT.
The incidence of HF increases up to 14.5% in women 15 years after
HSCT. Risk factors for CVD following HSCT include age, anthracycline dose, chest radiation exposure, hypertension, DM, and smoking.666
Long-term follow-up surveillance, based on CV toxicity risks
(Table 12), includes patient education and CVRF optimization. An annual clinical CV risk assessment is recommended for all adult CS to optimize CVRF control, promote a healthy lifestyle, and symptom review. This can be done in collaboration with primary care or a

specialist in CV medicine with expertise in CVRF management. CS at high or very high risk of future CVD can be divided into those at high early risk (within 5 years of completing cancer therapy) and those at high late risk (.30 years from completing treatment). The timing and frequency of other complementary tests depends upon the risk for
CTR-CVT (Figure 38).
CS with a high or very high baseline risk and patients with abnormal
LV function at the end-of-therapy assessment have a high or very high early risk, particularly in the ﬁrst 2 years.61,667,668 Annual CV assessment with clinical examination, ECG, and NP measurement is recommended in CS. TTE should be considered at years 1, 3, and 5 after completion of cardiotoxic cancer therapy and every 5 years thereafter in asymptomatic very high- and early high-risk adult CS.
In adult CS with late high CTR-CVT risk (e.g. young adults with
Hodgkin lymphoma or sarcomas who received a high total cumulative anthracycline dose or patients treated with high-dose radiation to a ﬁeld involving the heart, e.g. Mantle RT) there is a progressive risk of CTRCD.661,669 Annual CV assessment with clinical examination, ECG, and NP measurement is recommended, starting 5 years after the end of treatment, provided the end-of-therapy assessment at 12 months is normal. TTE should also be considered every 5 years,
as well as non-invasive screening for CAD (Section 8.3) and carotid disease (Section 8.5) according to local protocols.670
The long-term effects of CTRCD caused by trastuzumab and other targeted cancer therapies (e.g. TKI) beyond 10 years are unknown. Currently, there is no recommendation for lifelong surveillance in these CS unless they have another indication.
CV assessment with clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography,
and NP measurement every 5 years should be considered in asymptomatic adult CS at moderate risk of future CTR-CVT and a normal end-of-therapy CV assessment.

8.3. Coronary artery disease
Any vascular location within the RT treatment volume is at increased risk for both accelerated atherosclerosis and RT-related vasculopathy.173,392 RT to the chest (e.g. treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma,
early-stage BC, lung and oesophageal cancer, and for some patients receiving infradiaphragmatic irradiation if the apex of the heart is within the treatment volume) increases the risk of CAD. The latency between RT and the appearance of CAD varies from a few years to several decades, depending upon the presence or absence of preexisting atherosclerosis and the age of the patient at the time of
RT. This is a serious complication for young CS with a good prognosis and long-life expectancy (e.g. BC and Hodgkin lymphoma).389,390
Patients treated for mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma have shown an increased risk of CAD as a ﬁrst cardiac event.400 RT-induced CAD
depends on the location of the RT treatment volume and most commonly affects either the proximal left anterior descending or the right coronary arteries. RT-related vasculopathy is progressive and typically manifests in severe, diffuse, long, smooth and concentric angiographic lesions.679,680
The risk and severity of CAD increases with radiation dose, larger volume exposed, younger age at time of treatment (,25 years),390
time from treatment, smoking,400 the presence of other typical
CVRF, type of radiation source, and concurrent metabolic risk factors.493 RT accelerates pre-existing atherosclerosis leading to increased ACS risk within 10 years of treatment.681
Patients with RT-induced CAD undergoing PCI with bare-metal stent or balloon angioplasty have an increased risk of all-cause and
CV mortality.682 Conversely, after PCI with a drug-eluting stent,
there is no difference in target lesion revascularization or cardiac mortality between patients with and without prior chest RT.683
Surgical revascularization in patients with prior RT may be complicated by poor tissue healing (skin and sternum), RT-induced injury to the left and right internal mammary arteries (LIMA and RIMA, respectively), inadequate target coronary vessels, and increased sternotomy-related pain.684 Pre-operative assessment of internal mammary artery viability, venous access, and sternal wound healing is recommended in CS with RT-induced CAD where CABG is considered. PCI with drug-eluting stents may be considered over CABG
in CS with RT-induced severe left main or three-vessel disease, with a high SYNTAX (SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXus and cardiac surgery) score (.22), in whom the planned PCI is technically feasible given the increased complications associated with CABG after mediastinal RT.
Screening for CAD should be considered in high-risk patients who have received chest RT to a treatment volume including the heart.
Screening should take the form of functional imaging and/or CCTA beginning at 5 years post-RT.234,484 The natural history of RT-related vasculopathy is different to atherosclerosis and may accelerate rapidly.173
Functional cardiac imaging should be considered in asymptomatic CS
with pre-existing CAD or when new signiﬁcant CAD is detected on anatomical imaging. In asymptomatic patients with inducible ischaemia secondary to RT-induced CAD, a MDT is recommended to discuss revascularization needs according to the location of the RT-induced CAD,
the ischaemia burden, LV function, arrhythmia burden, time since treatment, time since previous normal review (if available), concomitant valvular disease, risks of surgical or percutaneous revascularization,
medical options, and patient preference.173
Platinum-based chemotherapies are now recognized to cause
CAD in CS. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy for testicular cancer is associated with a
1.5–7-fold increased risk of developing
CAD.421,493,685 Testicular CS who received platinum-based chemotherapy should have their CVRF tightly controlled and be educated to report any new chest pain or cardiac symptoms to their doctor promptly. The role of screening for CAD in patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy is unknown.
Aggressive risk-factor modiﬁcation and CV diagnostic work-up strongly enhance survival.5,672 Medical therapy with aspirin and statins for primary/secondary prevention, and beta-blockers and nitrates for symptom control, are recommended in CS.686,687

8.4. Valvular heart disease
VHD can appear in CS at any point in time but typically occurs
10 or more years after cancer treatment.691 Chest RT is the main risk factor in CS, in particular at higher dose ranges, which can cause either stenosis or regurgitation,
or both.391
The reported incidences of valvular regurgitation are up to
40% of CS survivors who received high-dose chest RT to a volume involving the heart, with ,10% presenting with clinically signiﬁcant VHD.670
Prognosis and management depend on the extent and severity of
VHD, as it does in patients without cancer.692 TAVI should be considered for patients with symptomatic RT-induced severe aortic stenosis at intermediate surgical risk.504,506,693,694 Similar strategies with percutaneous mitral valve repair or replacement can be considered.695 Importantly, commonly used calculators such STS PROM
(Society of Thoracic Surgeons–Predicted Risk of Mortality) or
EuroSCORE
(European
System for
Cardiac
Operative
Risk
Evaluation) II507 may underestimate the surgery-related risk in CS,
and especially those who develop RT-induced VHD, due to additional RT-related risk factors such as pericardial calciﬁcation, aortic calciﬁcation, increased bleeding risk, impaired skin healing, and RT-related pulmonary ﬁbrosis. A Heart Team with cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists, and cardio-oncology specialists should review each case to guide appropriate treatment. The Heart Team recommendation should be discussed with the patient, who can then make an informed treatment choice.
8.5. Peripheral artery disease and stroke
Peripheral arterial and cerebrovascular disease in CS can be due to the continuum of vascular disease pre-existing before, or developing during or after cancer therapy. Cancer therapies such as cisplatin,
BCR-ABL inhibitors, and RT can have a direct long-lasting effect on the vasculature. Approximately 30% of CML patients on nilotinib may develop PAD, which is clinically recognized 2–4 years after the start of therapy.698 The disease process may progress even after discontinuation of nilotinib. Long-term vascular effects, generally associated with vascular reactivity, can also be seen in patients treated with ponatinib, cisplatin, and bleomycin.699,700 Accelerated vascular aging, inﬂammation, ﬁbrosis, and atherosclerosis are characteristic consequences of RT.701 Up to 30% of patients may develop signiﬁcant carotid artery stenoses (.70%) after head/neck radiation.702,703
Vascular disease can also be an indirect consequence of cancer and its therapy, e.g. via reduction in physical activity, hyperlipidaemia, DM,
obesity, hypothyroidism, and/or kidney disease. These CVRF-related effects are mostly additive to the direct treatment-related effects.
Promoting vascular health and preventing vascular disease in CS is recommended.672 This should be in line with the 2021 ESC Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice.19
8.6. Pericardial complications
The risk of long-term pericardial complications after cancer drug-induced acute pericarditis, caused by anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and bleomycin, is unknown but generally considered low. Long-term dasatinib treatment may lead to pericardial effusion and pericarditis. The incidence of long-term ICI-associated pericardial complications is low.10
RT-induced chronic pericardial diseases can appear months to decades after the initial RT and constrictive pericarditis is the most serious.173,392 Incidence is difﬁcult to determine, and many cases are initially asymptomatic.704 Five-yearly echocardiographic surveillance for pericardial constriction in CS following RT-induced acute pericarditis may be considered. The absolute risk is considerably reduced with modern radiation protocols,704 but a high rate of pericardial effusion has still been reported in patients with lung (grade ≥2,
.40%705) and oesophageal cancer (.25%706) treated with RT.
Pericardial disease has been less investigated than other
RT-induced CVD, and clear protocols for post-therapy surveillance are lacking.707,708 In CS with chronic pericardial effusions following
RT, cardiac imaging can assess for evidence of inﬂammation,
PCI may be considered in CS with radiation-induced CAD with severe left main or three-vessel disease with a high SYNTAX score
(.22) in whom the procedure is technically feasible.682,689,690

constriction, or tamponade.709 Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy or pericardial window creation should be used in selected cases for large or growing chronic effusions if haemodynamic compromise develops. Management of these conditions should follow general guideline recommendations.14,444
8.7. Arrhythmias and autonomic disease
Arrhythmias, conduction disease, and autonomic disease are common complications in CS. Conduction disease after thoracic RT is typically associated with other CTR-CVT.710 It may include AV
block, bundle branch block, and sick sinus syndrome that should be monitored and treated according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy.443
Patients who require valve replacement after thoracic RT have a high risk of post-operative AV block requiring permanent pacemaker therapy.711 Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias are more common in patients after thoracic RT,712 possibly due to RT-induced myocardial ﬁbrosis. A common long-term complication after HSCT is supraventricular arrhythmia including AF and atrial ﬂutter,457 particularly in CS treated with anthracyclines or with new CVRF or CV toxicity.
Autonomic dysfunction is an emerging but poorly understood complication observed in CS, and is most frequently observed as a late complication after thoracic RT. Orthostatic hypotension, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and loss of circadian heart rate variability can occur.713,714
Physicians caring for these patients should consider referral for autonomic evaluation. In addition, the perception of angina pain may be impaired,714 making the diagnosis of post-radiation CAD challenging.
Evidence-based pharmacological treatment strategies are based on studies of patients with other autonomic dysfunction aetiologies
(e.g. DM or inﬁltrative diseases) and the reported effectiveness is generally poor.714
8.8. Metabolic syndrome, lipid abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension
There is a growing understanding about shared CVRF that may be responsible for cancer development or progression and premature
CV morbi-mortality.34 Modiﬁable CVRF continue to be underdiagnosed and undertreated in CS, especially hypertension,715 obesity,
DM, metabolic syndrome,716 and dyslipidaemia. Early diagnosis via standardized risk-based screening and management of these conditions according to general ESC Guidelines is recommended19 to improve long-term outcomes in CS.672
Increasing numbers of patients with cancer are already overweight or obese at cancer diagnosis,717 and additional weight gain is a frequent complication of anticancer treatments.718 Obesity is associated with metabolic syndrome, worsening CVRF, and cancer.
Increasing evidence indicates that being overweight increases the risk of cancer recurrence and reduces the likelihood of disease-free survival and overall survival among those diagnosed with cancer.719–
724 There is also growing evidence to support intentional weight loss post-treatment in CS, which may result in improved prognosis and survival.719 Dietary patterns characterized by a high intake of vegetables/fruits and whole grains has been shown to be associated with reduced mortality and cancer recurrence when compared with a high intake of reﬁned grains, processed and red meats, and high-fat dairy products.725–727
The identiﬁcation and treatment of hyperlipidaemia in CS is associated with a profound impact on outcomes.182,183 There is a beneﬁt for CS from an all-cause mortality perspective as well as for decreasing cancer recurrence.728–730
Several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic beneﬁts of exercise during primary anticancer treatment,731,732 and exercise is recommended during and after anticancer treatment.11,733 For CS,734
aerobic exercise results in improved survival.735 Based on current guidelines, patients undergoing anticancer therapy and long-term
CS should be encouraged to exercise for at least 150 min per week.736
8.9. Pregnancy in cancer survivors
Improvements in the treatment of cancer have led to an increasing number of female paediatric and adolescent CS who experience pregnancy many years after their oncological treatments.
Approximately 60% of them will have been previously exposed to anthracycline chemotherapy or chest RT and they have a 15-fold increase in their lifetime risk of developing HF.737 As young CS enter their reproductive years and contemplate pregnancy, it is important to understand the impact of cancer and its treatment on fertility,
pregnancy outcomes, and CV health. There are limited data available regarding CV risk in pregnancy following cancer treatments. The overall incidence of LVD or HF associated with pregnancy in female adult CS varies according to the studied population. In a single institution report including 337 female CS treated with cardiotoxic therapies, 58 (17%) had a subsequent pregnancy.738 Cardiac events,
deﬁned as LVEF , 50% on two TTE or new CAD, were identiﬁed in 17 patients.738 Patients with cardiac events were likely to be younger at cancer diagnosis, received a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline, and had a longer delay (in years) from cancer treatment to ﬁrst pregnancy compared with pregnant women with no cardiac event.738 In a recent meta-analysis of six studies, the weighted risk of pregnancy-associated LVD or HF in CS treated with anthracyclines was 1.7% with no reported maternal cardiac deaths.739 Major risk factors for CV events during pregnancy in CS include CTRCD (incidence 28%; 47.4-fold higher odds),739 younger age at cancer diagnosis,738,740 longer time from cancer treatment to ﬁrst pregnancy, and cumulative anthracycline dose.738

Management by an expert MDT (the pregnancy heart team) is recommended for all CS with CTRCD who are considering pregnancy.739,741,742 The risk of HF in CS without CTRCD is low,
although vigilance remains important for potential maternal cardiac complications.
8.10. Pulmonary hypertension
Long-term clinical evaluation may be considered in patients who develop PH during therapy (Section 6). In patients with new exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, or angina, a TTE is recommended to assess the probability of PH. As TTE alone is not enough to conﬁrm the diagnosis of PH, CS diagnosed with high PH probability require a right-heart catheterization to conﬁrm the diagnosis. PH should be treated according to general guidelines with referral to a specialist PH service.620
9. Special populations
9.1. Cardiac tumours
Cardiac tumours are classiﬁed as either benign or malignant.743 Over
90% of primary cardiac tumours are benign (myxomas are predominant in adults, rhabdomyomas in children).744 Malignant primary tumours most commonly consist of sarcomas (approximately
65%) or lymphomas (approximately 25%).745 Cardiac metastases
(from melanoma, lymphoma, leukaemia, breast, lung, and oesophageal cancers) are much more common than primary cardiac tumours
(Figure 39).746 Presenting symptoms are paraneoplastic (fever, weakness, fatigue), thromboembolic, haemodynamic (due to compression or obstruction from the tumour) or arrhythmic.747,748
The diagnostic pathway should be based on knowledge about tumour type epidemiology, imaging features, and usually the requirement for a histopathological diagnosis. This topic has been extensively reviewed in
ESC CardioMed,749 and here we summarize the main recommendations for differential diagnosis and management. Differential diagnosis should exclude cardiac thrombi or the presence of chemotherapy catheters. Imaging must assess the possibilities of cardiac surgery, and may include: (1) echocardiography (initial approach using TTE or transoesophageal echocardiography)748,750; (2) CMR (for cardiac tumour tissue characterization)751,752; and (3) CT and PET (to distinguish malignant from benign lesions and assess for non-cardiac metastatic disease or primary cancers) (Figure 40).753,754
Myxomas are primarily treated with surgery with a good prognosis. Malignant tumours are associated with a poor prognosis and evidence of the best treatment is lacking. Complete surgical resection is often impossible and adjuvant RT, systemic chemotherapy, and/or debulking palliative surgery are needed.755 Cardiac aggressive B-cell lymphomas require histopathological diagnosis (often obtained via analysis of pericardial effusion, EMB, or direct surgical biopsy) and are treated with chemotherapy,
possibly followed by
RT
(Table 13).756
9.2. Pregnant patients with cancer
The diagnosis of cancer during pregnancy is uncommon (1 in every
1000 pregnant women is diagnosed with cancer), with BC, melanoma, and cervical cancer being the most frequent diagnoses.757
Chemotherapy is generally not applied during the ﬁrst trimester due to the high risk of foetal congenital abnormalities (up to 20%)
and cytotoxic chemotherapies have different risk proﬁles during the second or third trimesters.758,759 Furthermore, chemotherapy administration is usually not given beyond week 34 of gestation to provide a 3-week window between the last cycle and delivery.757
Supplementary data, Table S19 summarizes the chemotherapies for pregnant patients with cancer.760,761
Cardiac assessment prior to chemotherapy in pregnant women with cancer should consist of clinical history, physical examination,
ECG, cardiac biomarker assessment and TTE (Figure 41).741
Baseline and follow-up TTE should be interpreted in the context of physiological haemodynamic alterations during pregnancy. In normal pregnancy, increase in stroke volume, heart rate, and pre-load blood volume, and decrease in systemic vascular resistance, lead to an increase in cardiac output from the ﬁrst trimester to 80–85%
above baseline by the third trimester.762–764 An increase in LV
mass and LV and RV volumes is observed in the third trimester.
During normal pregnancy, LVEF is usually unchanged and can be used for CTRCD monitoring. Although NP and cTn may be slightly elevated during normal pregnancy (NT-proBNP , 300 ng/L, BNP ,
100 pg/mL,14 and hs-cTnT765,766), serial evaluation may be useful for

close CTRCD monitoring during cancer treatment with the higher cut-off NP levels for pregnancy.
The topic of CVD during pregnancy has been extensively reviewed in the 2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of CVD
during pregnancy.741 Here we focus on speciﬁc recommendations in pregnant women with cancer receiving anthracycline chemotherapy.
9.2.1. Left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure
Medical history evaluating signs and symptoms of HF should be performed at every clinical visit of pregnant women with cancer receiving anthracycline chemotherapy. More frequent CV evaluations with
TTE during treatments with potential CTRCD risk should be advised
(e.g. every 4–8 weeks or every two cycles for a 3-weekly anthracycline chemotherapy cycle). The management of clinical HF or asymptomatic
LVD during pregnancy is fully described in the 2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of CVD during pregnancy.741
9.2.2. Venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism
Pregnant patients with cancer have an increased risk of developing
VTE,
especially when hospitalized.767–769
Identiﬁed risks for VTE in pregnant patients include having a history of BC or previous chemotherapy in the past 6 months.

9.3. Carcinoid valvular heart disease
Carcinoid tumours represent rare neuroendocrine malignancies originating from the enterochromafﬁn cells (Figure 42).771 Carcinoid syndrome is a rare cause of acquired VHD including mainly rightsided valvular lesions, but also left-sided involvement, pericardial effusion, and myocardial metastases.772 Coronary artery vasospasm and paroxysmal atrial or ventricular tachycardias may rarely occur due to sympathetic stimulation. Cardiac metastases are reported with an incidence of 3.8% on the ventricles, conﬁrmed by PET-CT
scans.773,774 Data from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results) registry identiﬁed that approximately 20% of patients with neuroendocrine malignancies develop carcinoid syndrome
(7.6–32.4%), which is associated with shorter survival (4.7 years compared with 7.1 years in patients without carcinoid syndrome)
and poor quality of life.775 It is estimated that 20–50% of these patients present cardiac involvement, especially of the right-sided cardiac valves.771 In the presence of a patent foramen ovale, interatrial shunt, primary bronchial neuroendocrine tumour, or extensive liver metastases, humoral substances directly enter the systemic circulation, causing left-sided valvular involvement in up to one-third of cases.776
NP should be considered for screening and surveillance of patients at risk of carcinoid cardiac involvement and TTE is recommended in patients with NT-proBNP . 260 pg/mL or clinical signs or symptoms.777–780 In asymptomatic patients with NT-proBNP , 260 pg/
mL, repeat clinical and NP assessment should be considered every
6 months.
Survival has improved in carcinoid tumours, with the use of somatostatin analogues and surgical techniques in liver metastasis.
However, right HF still represents a major cause of death.781,782
Many patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to carcinoid syndrome require both tricuspid and pulmonary valve surgery.783
Administration of i.v. somatostatin analogues (e.g. octreotide) is recommended to avoid a peri-operative carcinoid crisis. The infusion should be started on the morning of the procedure (up to 12 h preoperatively), continued throughout the procedure (surgery, preoperative coronary angiography, pacemaker implantation), and postoperatively for at least 48 h following valve surgery or until stable if a carcinoid crisis is triggered post-operatively.772
The optimal choice of valve prosthesis is still a matter of debate due to the balance of risk of both accelerated bioprosthetic valve degeneration vs. bleeding risks in patients with extensive liver metastases requiring therapeutic anticoagulation for mechanical valves.784,785
Complications include AV block, requiring pacemaker implantation in 25% of patients.786 Frequently, the reduced RV function does not improve despite tricuspid valve replacement and HF persists.787
Thrombus formation on the tricuspid bioprosthesis can occur, especially during the ﬁrst 3 months post-operatively, and oral anticoagulation with VKA may be considered. Persistent serotonin elevation can cause recurrent bioprosthesis valve ﬁbrosis. Valve-in-valve transcatheter intervention has been reported in bioprosthetic valve failure in metastatic carcinoid heart disease; however, future research is needed to deﬁne its role.783,788,789
In patients with left-sided carcinoid valvular involvement, closure of interatrial shunts should be considered, although only sparse data exist for this approach.

9.4. Amyloid light-chain cardiac amyloidosis
Amyloid light-chain amyloidosis is a plasma cell dyscrasia, which is typically treated with therapies very similar to those used in
MM, including PI-based therapy.792 It can occur in conjunction with myeloma or independently as a light-chain proteinproducing disorder. Amyloid light-chain amyloidosis is a systemic disease 793,794 and it is critical to have a high degree of suspicion for the diagnosis of cardiac involvement (amyloid light-chain cardiac amyloidosis [AL-CA]) because a combination of specialized tests is needed to make an accurate diagnosis (Figure 43).290,793,795,796

Cardiac serum biomarkers are an essential step in the diagnostic and prognostic assessments for these patients.797–799 AL-CA has been extensively reviewed in a recent position paper from the
Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases.290
The classical non-invasive deﬁnition of AL-CA is based on clinical suspicion, biomarkers, TTE, CMR, and nuclear scintigraphy criteria
(Figure 43). Persistent troponin elevation and disproportionately high NT-proBNP (generally .300 ng/L in the absence of renal failure or AF) to ventricular function parameters on TTE is a characteristic red ﬂag for AL-CA.800 A decrease in GLS with a distinctive apical sparing pattern (preserved GLS values in the LV
apical region) is considered speciﬁc for cardiac amyloidosis, although it is not helpful to distinguish between amyloid light-chain and transthyretin amyloidosis.801 Additionally, GLS ≥−15% may serve as an independent prognostic factor of poor overall survival in patients with AL-CA.802 CMR with LGE and parametric imaging has emerged as a new non-invasive gold-standard for diagnosis
(Figure 43).803,804 Nuclear scintigraphy can differentiate transthyretin amyloidosis from AL-CA supported by the presence of monoclonal protein.290 EMB should be considered in patients with suspected AL-CA involvement if CMR is not diagnostic.290 A rare condition that may coexist with AL-CA is light-chain deposition disease, which frequently associates extensive renal involvement and poor prognosis.799
Recently, a staging system for AL-CA has demonstrated the prognostic impact of cTnT and NT-proBNP levels.797 Heart progression criteria are deﬁned by NT-proBNP progression (.30% and
.300 ng/L increase), cTnT progression (≥33% increase) or ejection fraction decrease (≥10% decrease).805–807 However, evaluating a cardiac response to treatment using a decrease in NT-proBNP levels and New York Heart Association class improvement is still challenging.
AL-CA frequently results in HF, major cardiac arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, sudden cardiac death, and an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis.808–810 Beta-blockers, ACE-I, ARB, or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor may not be well tolerated because of hypotension.290 The management of AF is very complex in this population. Amiodarone is the preferred antiarrhythmic treatment and digitalis should be used with caution. Anticoagulation is recommended in all AL-CA patients with AF independent of the
CHA2DS2-VASc score due to the high prothrombotic risk unless there is a contraindication.290 Currently, the guidelines for implanted devices, including pacemakers and ICDs, do not provide speciﬁc recommendations for AL-CA and decisions should be individualized after a MDT discussion.811
Optimal systemic therapy for AL-CA is rapidly changing, and the efﬁcacy of certain combination therapies continues to improve.812,813 Autologous HSCT for AL-CA is not universally utilized but is a viable treatment option.814 Therapies for AL-CA are evolving, and daratumumab and PI show promise for improved outcomes.792,815–817 Clinical observations, but no RCT evidence,
suggest the potential role of doxycycline to improve survival in patients with AL-CA.818,819
9.5. Cardiac implantable electronic devices
RT can cause malfunction of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).443,823 The risk of RT-induced CIED malfunction generally increases with the radiation dose,824,825 although the strongest predictor of malfunction is the magnitude of exposure to neutron emission from high-energy photon RT, conventionally deﬁned as a beam energy .10 megavolts (MV).824,826,827
Non-neutron-producing treatment is therefore preferable in patients with a CIED.826
RT-induced CIED malfunction can manifest in: (1) transient interference, with inappropriate triggering during the irradiation only; (2)
a reset, reverting to backup settings, recoverable with device reprogramming; and, rarely (3) permanent damage to the device due to direct CIED irradiation.826,827
The clinical consequences of a CIED malfunction include the inhibition of pacing and inappropriate pacing at maximum sensor rate.826
The clinical effects of device malfunction are greatest when the patient is pacing-dependent. Theoretically, oversensing might lead to inappropriate ICD shocks, although this has not been reported in the literature.826
More recent registries have reported minimal or no adverse effects of RT on CIED malfunction.827,828 Nevertheless, as it is not possible to predict the behaviour of a CIED within or close to an RT
treatment volume, general recommendations should be followed to minimize patient risk (Figures 44–46).188,824,825
Patients with a CIED should be reviewed by their cardiologist/
electrophysiologist to assess the risk of CIED malfunction and

patients should be informed of the potential risks of RT.443 For patients with rate-adaptive pacemakers, consideration should be given to temporary deactivation of the sensor during RT. Although inactivation of antitachycardia therapies in patients with ICDs is recommended in several publications, by either reprogramming or application of a magnet to ICDs, it is infrequently performed in clinical practice.826
CIEDs should not be placed directly in the RT treatment volume and the cumulative dose should not exceed 2 Gy to a pacemaker or 1 Gy to an ICD.827 If the CIED is situated in the path of the planned radiation beam, it could also interfere with adequate tumour treatment. The photon beam energy should be kept ,10 MV as the risk of device malfunction/damage increases above this threshold. If higher doses are needed or if the CIED cannot be kept out of the beam, consideration should be given to removing and relocating the CIED away from the beam, although this will only very rarely be necessary. The main reason for device relocation is to allow adequate RT treatment of the tumour, but consideration should also be given to possible
RT-induced CIED malfunction/damage with consequent need for
CIED replacement.826 However, CIED explant and resiting carries signiﬁcant risks, including the risk of infection, which may be of

particular importance in patients receiving chemotherapy or those who are immunosuppressed. For most patients in whom deﬁnitive tumour treatment is planned, the risk/beneﬁt ratio will usually favour device relocation, whereas for patients receiving palliative RT or with signiﬁcant comorbidities, relocation could be avoided.826 These decisions should be made by a MDT in conjunction with the patient. Device relocation is not recommended for CIEDs receiving a maximum cumulative incident dose of ,5 Gy, where the risk is considered negligible.826,828
There should be continuous visual and voice contact with the patient during each treatment fraction. CIEDs should be periodically checked in patients with ICDs, especially those receiving .10 MV

photon beam RT, CIED evaluation appears largely unnecessary.827
For patients treated with proton beam RT, special consideration should be paid to the neutron component of the beam, as the risk of CIED reset is potentially signiﬁcant.824,830 The CIED should be rechecked within 2 weeks of completion of RT treatment. Systematic remote CIED monitoring may be helpful to optimize the patient’s surveillance.831

### 10 Patient information,

communication, and self-management
Collaboration between different healthcare professionals and patients is of paramount importance for the most effective management of patients with cancer and CVD. Appropriate language and communication should be used to allow patients to receive clear and accurate information about their condition, and play an active role in managing their treatment.11
The ﬁrst goal of this process is to raise the patient’s awareness of the possible presence or development of a CVD, either during cancer or after having some oncological therapy. Patients should understand that cancer and CVD share many CVRF and reducing risk is vital for the prevention of cancer, cancer relapse, and the development or worsening of a CVD during or after treatment. Patients should be informed—at the end of chemotherapy—that a personalized follow-up plan and regular CV controls are needed to detect potential reversible stages of CV toxicities.

and support to promote healthy lifestyle and to treat modiﬁable

Patients should also be advised not to stop cardioprotective therapies without medical guidance, even if they recover their cardiac function. To help in this complex task, leaﬂets speciﬁcally designed for this context may be used,832,833 eventually with the aid of digital tools (Figure 47).
11. The role of scientiﬁc societies in the promotion and development of cardio-oncology in modern medicine
Cardio-oncology is a subspecialty that has seen huge development and growth in recent years with the formation—in almost all national and international societies—of cardio-oncology working groups.
Moreover, cancer and medical associations have also developed an increasing interest in cardio-oncology. Important roles of these scientiﬁc societies are clinical research, education, and advocacy. The ESC-CCO
strategic plan and mission include improvement of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of CTR-CVT and enhancement of the standard of care for patients with cancer (Figure 48).
12. Key messages
This is the ﬁrst ESC cardio-oncology Guideline and contains 272 new recommendations. The key messages from this guideline are:
• A guiding principle of cardio-oncology is integration, and cardio-oncology providers must have knowledge of the broad scope of cardiology, oncology, and haematology. Communication between different healthcare professionals is critical to optimize the care of patients with cancer and CVD.
• Cardio-oncology programmes facilitate cancer treatment by minimizing unnecessary cancer therapy interruptions and CTR-CVT

across the entire continuum of cancer care. In patients who develop CTR-CVT, a MDT discussion is required to balance the risk/beneﬁt of cancer treatment discontinuation.
• There is a new international deﬁnition of CTR-CVT (Table 3).
• CV toxicity risk is a dynamic variable. This guideline is structured to provide a personalized approach to care based upon the baseline
CV toxicity risk. A baseline CV risk assessment is recommended for all patients with cancer scheduled to receive a potentially cardiotoxic anticancer therapy. This enables the oncology team to consider CV risk while making cancer treatment choices, educating patients regarding their CV risk, and personalizing CV surveillance and follow-up strategy.
• Primary prevention of CV toxicity from cancer therapy aims to avoid or minimize the development of CTR-CVT in patients without CVD.
• Secondary prevention refers to interventions in patients with preexisting CVD, including prior or new CTR-CVT. A MDT is recommended when patients with cancer have complex CVD that may impact on their cancer treatment.
• Deﬁning and delivering an appropriate prevention and surveillance plan for potential CV complications is recommended. Optimal management of CVRF and pre-existing CVD is mandatory to facilitate cancer therapy and to improve patients’ prognosis.
• Detailed monitoring pathways during cancer therapy—including
3D echocardiography, GLS, and cardiac biomarkers—are provided to detect CV toxicity based upon speciﬁc cancer therapies and baseline CV toxicity risk.
• Treatment recommendations for CTRCD during and after cancer therapy depend upon CTRCD severity and symptoms. New guidance on continuing trastuzumab in BC patients who develop asymptomatic moderate CTRCD (LVEF 40–49%) while starting cardioprotective medication is provided.
• Use of a structured algorithm to guide decisions regarding anticoagulation management in patients with cancer presenting with AF
or VTE encompassing the TBIP assessment is encouraged.
• After cancer treatment is completed,
the focus of the cardio-oncology team shifts to coordination of long-term followup. This starts with an ‘end-of-treatment’ assessment in the ﬁrst year after treatment, reviewing patients with cancer who have received cardiotoxic anticancer therapies to reassess their CV toxicity risk and guide long-term surveillance planning.
• A new algorithm (Figure 37) is provided to guide weaning off of CV
medication in CS.
• Patients with cancer, CS, and the patient’s family/carers should receive guidance to promote healthy lifestyle and recognize and report signs and symptoms of CVD, to receive prompt and effective treatment, without interfering with their cancer treatment.
• Patients must receive psychological support when needed and clear and accurate information about their condition to play an active role in managing their treatment and increase adherence to cancer and CV treatments.
13. Future needs
There are a low number of dedicated cardio-oncology services and most patients are reviewed in general cardiology clinics in Europe and worldwide. Strategic investments in cardio-oncology care networks and cardio-oncology services provision are needed to meet the projected increased clinical demand in the near future,834 and to facilitate research, training, and educational activities. A dedicated training core curriculum for a minimum of
1-year medical training is urgently needed. It may include: (1)
knowledge of the broad scope of cardiology, oncology, and haematology; (2) CV competencies for CTR-CVT prevention,
surveillance, and management of patients with cancer in dedicated outpatients’ cardio-oncology clinics; (3) inpatient consultative services; and (4) dedicated time to achieve competences in CV imaging, HF, and vascular cardiology.
Collaboration between healthcare providers, clinical and basic investigators, healthcare authorities, regulatory bodies, advocacy groups, and patients’ associations is needed to address future needs
(see Section 11).
As this Guideline was developed, it became clear that there is a signiﬁcant lack of RCT to guide decision-making, with many recommendations supported by level of evidence C. This is complicated by the fast-moving pace of new oncology treatment developments against a background of dynamic CV toxicity likelihood. Therefore, large numbers of patients and longer follow-up are required to provide sufﬁcient statistical power and deﬁnitive answers. In the future, the following strategies and areas of research are priorities:
• New trial designs focusing upon the ‘at-risk’ cancer patient populations.
• Validating current HFA-ICOS risk assessment tools and surveillance algorithms.
• Assessment of new technologies for the detection of early
CTRCD, broadening the biomarker panel and recognizing the speciﬁc patterns in early myocardial damage.
• Reﬁning
CV
risk scores
(e.g.
EuroSCORE
II,
SCORE2,
SCORE2-OP, CHA2DS2-VASc, HAS-BLED, SYNTAX) for application in cancer populations.
• Optimal treatment of steroid-resistant ICI CV toxicity and longterm CV effects of ICI therapy.
• Selection criteria for modern percutaneous structural (TAVI,
Mitraclip, LAA occluder devices) and electrophysiological (ablation) CV therapies in patients with active cancer.
• Patient-speciﬁc predictive algorithms for QTc prolongation with cancer drugs.
• Assessment of genetic proﬁles in more speciﬁc CTRCD risk prediction.
• Identiﬁcation of the cancer patient populations with mild or moderate CTRCD during treatment who can safely wean off long-term
CV medication.
• Optimal modalities for screening long-term survivor populations for the complications of anthracycline chemotherapy and mediastinal radiation.
• Creation of large cardio-oncology registries to collect ‘big data’ on large patient populations.
• Application of artiﬁcial intelligence and other new data analytics to identify new patients with cancer at risk and new parameters that can predict risk of CTR-CVT, response to speciﬁc cardioprotective interventions, and long-term risk and safety to wean off CV
therapies initiated during cancer treatment.

### 14 Gaps in evidence

Cancer and CVD are the two major public health problems with great economic and social impact. In addition, CTR-CVT are associated with anexcessofbothCVandoncologicalmortality,especiallywhenthey limit patients’ ability to complete effective treatments. However, the intersection of cancer and CVD has only recently gained wider interest and many areas with lack of evidence need to be addressed in future research.
Role of cardio-oncology services and cardio-oncology care networks
• Robust evidence on the impact of dedicated cardio-oncology programmes and cardio-oncology rehabilitation on the prognosis of patients with cancer and survivors.
• Speciﬁcation of roles of different healthcare professionals (including nurses and pharmacists) in cardio-oncology teams.
• Cardio-oncology care networks to improve the management of patients with cancer and to discuss difﬁcult cases.
• Cardio-oncology team support and involvement in oncology trials design (including patients’ representatives).
• Understand how to engage patients with cancer in their own CV
care (inclusion of digital tools).
Research, education, and training in cardio-oncology
• Consensus about CV toxicity deﬁnitions used in oncology trials.
• Deﬁne standards for CV toxicity monitoring in oncology trials to avoid unexpected CV toxicities when new drugs are approved for clinical use.
• Relevant model systems to allow high-throughput screening of new cancer treatments for CV toxicity.
• Improved knowledge on CV toxicity mechanisms of new targeted cancer therapies and ICI and optimal treatment of CV toxicities.
• Improved knowledge on the effects of radiation to speciﬁc cardiac substructures and the interactions between cardiotoxic systemic therapy and RT.
• Further research into the underlying mechanisms that connect
CVD and cancer, such as a genetic predisposition to CV toxicity.
• Personalized medicine and use of big data and artiﬁcial intelligence tools.
Cardiovascular toxicity risk stratiﬁcation
• Development of CV toxicity risk prediction tools including both treatment- and patient-related risk factors.
• Validated prospective CV toxicity risk scores based on clinical outcomes.
• Further research on the role of genetics in CV toxicity risk stratiﬁcation.
• Validation of CPET parameters for CV outcomes in patients with cancer.
Prevention, diagnosis, and management of CTR-CVT
• Raise awareness of the beneﬁts of minimizing CV risk in patients with cancer in order to reduce the risk of CTR-CVT.
• More data on new technologies (biomarkers, advanced echocardiography, CMR, etc.) and genetic proﬁles for the detection of early
CV toxicity.
• Prospective studies showing the impact on outcomes and/or quality of life (and frailty) of early CTR-CVT diagnosis and treatment.
• Further evidence from prospective RCTs to deﬁne when cardioprotective medications improve patients’ outcomes.
• Further research on the potential for aerobic exercise to reduce
CTR-CVT.
• RCTs of (new) CV therapies in patients with different types of
CTR-CVT.
Long-term cancer survivorship programmes
• Development of optimal CV follow-up programmes after treatment for cancer (research on risk stratiﬁcation, efﬁcacy, and frequency of screening protocols).
• Best screening strategies for RT-induced CAD.
• Further research on CV preventive strategies for long-term CS.

### 16 Quality indicators for cardio-oncology

Quality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care quality, including structural, process, and outcomes of care.835 They may also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to guideline recommendations, through associated quality improvement initiatives and the benchmarking of care providers.836,837 As such, the role of QIs in improving care and outcomes for CVD is increasingly recognized by healthcare authorities, professional organizations,
payers, and the public.835
The ESC understands the need for measuring and reporting quality and outcomes of CV care and has established methods for the development of the ESC QIs for the quantiﬁcation of care and outcomes for CVD.835 These methods were used to develop QIs pertinent to cardio-oncology in parallel with the writing of this
Clinical Practice Guideline document and through the collaboration with patient representatives and domain experts. The QIs, alongside their measurement speciﬁcations and development process will be published separately.
