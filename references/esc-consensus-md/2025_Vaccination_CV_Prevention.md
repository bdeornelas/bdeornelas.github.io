Abstract

Vaccination is increasingly acknowledged as an effective preventive measure not only against specific infections, but also for the prevention of car­
diovascular disease in high-risk patients. Specifically, a growing body of evidence suggests that vaccines against influenza, SARS-CoV-2, respiratory
syncytial virus, herpes zoster, and other viruses significantly reduce infection and for influenza the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in
vaccinated individuals.
   This clinical consensus statement examines the existing literature and accumulated evidence and offers practical clinical advice on vaccination tim­
ing and target demographics, specifically addressing complex clinical scenarios with a focus on cardiovascular conditions. It includes guidelines for
vaccinating vulnerable populations such as immunosuppressed individuals, patients with congenital heart disease, and pregnant women as well as
safety and potential complications of the procedure.
