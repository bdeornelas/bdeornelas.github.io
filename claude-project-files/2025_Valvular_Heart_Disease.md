Disclaimer. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) Guidelines represent the views of the ESC and the EACTS and were produced 
after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their publication. The ESC and the EACTS are not responsible in the event of any contradiction, discrepancy and/or ambiguity between the ESC/EACTS Guidelines and any other official recommendations or guidelines issued by the relevant public health authorities, in particular in relation 
to good use of healthcare or therapeutic strategies. Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC/EACTS Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well as in the 
determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies; however, the ESC/EACTS Guidelines do not override, in any way whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient and, where appropriate and/or 
necessary, the patient’s caregiver. Nor do the ESC/EACTS Guidelines exempt health professionals from taking into full and careful consideration the relevant official updated recommendations or 
guidelines issued by the competent public health authorities, in order to manage each patient’s case in light of the scientifically accepted data pursuant to their respective ethical and professional 
obligations. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the applicable rules and regulations relating to drugs and medical devices prior to making any clinical decision and to check whether 
a more recent version of this document exists. The ESC and the EACTS warn readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and decline any responsibility in this respect.

1. Preamble 
Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of assisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic 
approach for an individual patient with a given condition. ESC/EACTS 
Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals but do not override 
their individual responsibility to make appropriate and accurate decisions 
in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with 
the patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. 
It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription and to respect the ethical rules of their profession. 
ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given 
topic. Guideline topics are selected for updating after annual expert review of new evidence conducted by the ESC Clinical Practice 
Guidelines (CPG) Committee. ESC Policies and Procedures for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website 
(https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/ 
Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines). 
This guideline updates and replaces the previous version from 2021. This 
Task Force was selected by the ESC and the EACTS to include professionals

involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology and to include 
patient representatives and methodologists. The selection procedure included an open call for authors and aimed to include members from across 
the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty 
Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion. 
Guidelines Task Forces perform a critical review and evaluation of the 
published literature on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches including 
assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Recommendations are based on 
major randomized trials and relevant systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses, when available. Systematic literature searches are conducted in cases of controversy or uncertainty to ensure that all key 
studies were considered. For recommendations related to diagnosis 
and prognosis, additional types of evidence are included, such as diagnostic accuracy studies and studies focused on the development and validation of prognostic models. The strength of each recommendation and 
the level of evidence supporting it are weighed and scored according 
to pre-defined criteria as outlined in Tables 1 and 2. Patient-Reported 
Outcome Measures (PROMs) and Patient-Reported Experience 
Measures (PREMs) are also evaluated when available as the basis for recommendations and/or discussion in these guidelines. 
Evidence tables summarizing key information from relevant studies 
are generated to facilitate the formulation of recommendations, to

enhance comprehension of recommendations after publication, and to 
reinforce transparency in the guidelines development process. The tables are published in their own section of the guidelines and reference 
specific recommendation tables. 
After an iterative process of deliberations, a first Task Force vote on 
all recommendations is conducted prior to the initiation of rounds of 
review. A second Task Force vote on all recommendations is conducted after the final round of review and revision. For each vote, 
the Task Force follows ESC voting procedures and all recommendations require at least 75% agreement among voting members to be approved. Voting restrictions may be applied based on declarations of 
interests. 
The writing and reviewing panels provide declaration-of-interest 
forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential 
sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest are reviewed according to the ESC declaration-of-interest rules, which can 
be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/doi) and are 
compiled in a report published in a supplementary document with 
the guidelines. Funding for the development of these ESC/EACTS 
Guidelines was derived entirely from the ESC and the EACTS with 
no involvement of the healthcare industry. 
The ESC CPG Committee supervises and co-ordinates the preparation of new guidelines and approves their publication. In addition to 
review by the ESC CPG Committee, these ESC/EACTS Guidelines 
underwent multiple rounds of double-blind peer review on a dedicated 
online review platform. The review was conducted by topic experts, including members from ESC National Cardiac Societies, EACTS 
Network of National Cardiac Surgery Societies and from relevant 
ESC Subspecialty Communities. The Guideline Task Force considered 
all review comments and was required to respond to all those classified 
as major. After appropriate revisions, the Task Force, the ESC CPG 
Committee members and the EACTS Council members approved 
the final document for publication in the European Heart Journal and 
in the European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. 
Unless otherwise stated, the guideline content refers to sex, understood as the biological condition of being male or female, defined by 
genes, hormones, and sexual organs. Off-label use of medication may 
be presented in this guideline if a sufficient level of evidence shows 
that it can be considered medically appropriate for a given condition. 
However, decisions on off-label use must be made by the responsible 
health professional giving special consideration to ethical rules concerning healthcare, the specific situation of the patient, patient consent, and 
country-specific health regulations. 
2. Introduction 
New evidence has accumulated since the publication of the 2021 
European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Association for 
Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) Guidelines for the management of valvular 
heart disease, leading to the need for new recommendations (Table 3 
New recommendations) and revision of existing recommendations 
(Table 4 Revised recommendations) concerning the following topics: 
• The importance of shared and patient-centred decision-making by 
multidisciplinary expert Heart Teams working within a regional network has been reinforced. Patients with complex conditions or requiring complex procedures should be referred to high-volume 
centres, where corresponding expertise is concentrated to ensure 
high-quality treatment. 
• Advanced imaging modalities—such as three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), and cardiac 
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging—have gained importance and 
become a central aspect in the screening and evaluation of patients 
with valvular heart disease (VHD). 
• Emphasis is put on the importance of correctly assessing the cause(s) 
and mechanism(s) of all valve diseases. In particular, the distinction 
between atrial and ventricular secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) 
has clear implications in terms of prognosis and management. 
• New evidence has been published regarding the benefits of 
intervention for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis (AS) irrespective of symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and 
flow reserve. 
• The criteria used for decision-making concerning the optimal modality of AS treatment [transcatheter aortic valve (AV) implantation 
(TAVI) or surgical AV replacement (SAVR)] based on a Heart Team 
approach have been refined, including the combination of key aspects 
such as age, procedural risk, and anatomical suitability, incorporating 
estimated life expectancy and lifetime management considerations. 
• Further randomized evidence confirming the mid-term safety and efficacy of TAVI in low-risk patients has been published. 
• The indications for TAVI in patients with bicuspid AV (BAV) stenosis 
or severe aortic regurgitation (AR) at high surgical risk, based on anatomical suitability and a comprehensive Heart Team evaluation, are 
discussed. 
• Several advancements have been made regarding the treatment of 
patients with primary mitral regurgitation (PMR): refinement of the 
criteria for intervention in asymptomatic patients; demonstration 
of the value of minimally invasive mitral valve (MV) surgery to reduce 
the length of hospital stay and accelerate recovery; and large-scale 
data confirming the role of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair 
(TEER) in high-risk patients. 
• Longer-term follow-up data and two new randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) concerning the management of patients with ventricular 
SMR have been published. 
• The evidence for the treatment of tricuspid valve (TV) disease is 
growing—including new randomized data supporting concomitant 
TV repair during left-sided valve surgery, and transcatheter options 
(repair and replacement) that reduce tricuspid regurgitation (TR), 
promote reverse right ventricular (RV) remodelling, and improve 
quality of life compared with medical treatment. 
• Efforts have been made to provide improved guidance regarding the 
diagnostic steps and management of patients with multiple and mixed 
VHD. 
• Definitions of structural valve deterioration (SVD) have been updated and unified. 
• The recommendations concerning the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with VHD have been updated, and the importance of education and (self-)monitoring is emphasized. 
• Sex-specific considerations in patients with VHD have been extended and regrouped into a new dedicated section (see Section 17).   
Because of demographic changes, patients with VHD frequently 
present with concomitant cardiovascular diseases, increasing the complexity of treatment strategies. These Guidelines focus on acquired


<!-- PAGE 9 -->

### Page 9

VHD and do not deal in detail with overlapping cardiovascular diseases 
such as infective endocarditis,5 chronic coronary syndrome,6 and atrial 
fibrillation (AF),7 as well as all scenarios of aortic or congenital disease,8,9 because these topics are covered in separate Guidelines. 
The 2025 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart 
disease aim to be concise, focused on relevant issues for clinicians and 
patients, and to provide clear and simple practical recommendations, 
assisting healthcare providers in their daily clinical decision-making. A 
compilation of the evidence considered for new recommendations, or 
those with an updated class of recommendation or level of evidence, 
can be consulted online (see Supplementary data online, Evidence 
Tables). The Task Force for these Guidelines acknowledges that 
multiple factors influence and ultimately determine the most appropriate treatment of individual patients within a given community. 
These factors include the availability of equipment and technology, 
and the expertise and volumes, in complex procedures, such as valve 
repair or transcatheter interventions. Moreover, given the lack of evidence on some topics related to VHD, several recommendations are 
the result of expert consensus opinion. Therefore, deviations from 
these Guidelines may be appropriate in certain clinical circumstances, 
and decision-making should always be based on a collaborative, multidisciplinary Heart Team approach centred on individual characteristics, needs, and prognosis, as well as the preferences of the informed 
patient.

### 3 The Heart Team and Heart Valve

Centre 
3.1. The Heart Valve Network 
Despite increasing attention within the medical community, VHD continues to be underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population, and public awareness remains low.10–13 Beside screening using 
auscultation and imaging when appropriate, the co-ordinated implementation of Heart Teams, Heart Valve Centres, and Heart Valve 
Networks at a local level represents an essential step to timely diagnose 
and treat patients with VHD. 
An integrated regional Heart Valve Network, incorporating outpatient Heart Valve Clinics (for initial diagnosis and ongoing surveillance) and specialist Heart Valve Centres (for advanced imaging and 
surgical or transcatheter intervention), allows optimal patient care 
through timely access to specialist assessment, accurate diagnosis, improved decision-making, and matching of patients to healthcare providers with appropriate expertise, experience, and resources (Figure 1).12 
In addition, dedicated Heart Valve Clinics ensure consistent application 
of clinical guidelines, efficient use of resources, and overall high-quality 
patient care, which in turn may improve outcomes.14,15 Medical goals 
include careful clinical and echocardiographic evaluation, monitoring 
at appropriate time intervals (so-called ‘watchful waiting’), application 
Transcatheter closure should be considered for suitable 
PVLs with clinically significant regurgitation and/or 
haemolysis in patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk.

of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), timely referral, and 
post-procedural follow-up.15,16 Broader aims include patient education, 
the training of physicians and nurse specialists, swift and efficient access 
to specialist care, and recruitment into clinical trials. 
Heart Valve Centres should ensure that their facilities match institutional and local statutory requirements (Table 5), report procedural volumes and outcomes, and monitor treatment quality. They hold 
responsibility for the training and education of surgeons, interventional 
and imaging cardiologists, dedicated nurses, and allied professionals.17,18 
Expertise in the surgical management of coronary artery disease 
(CAD), vascular diseases, and complications must be available. New 
techniques should be taught by trained mentors using simulator models, when feasible, to minimize learning-curve effects. More broadly, 
Heart Valve Centres co-ordinate the management of patients with 
VHD across the entire Heart Valve Network, supporting services at 
community level, encouraging early referral, and promoting education 
and communication with other medical departments, referring cardiologists, primary care physicians, and rehabilitation clinics. 
3.1.1. Composition of the Heart Team 
The Heart Team is now an established feature of VHD programmes that 
has been formally endorsed by previous ESC/EACTS Guidelines19,20 and 
corresponding organizations worldwide.17 
The value of the Heart Team approach has become increasingly 
apparent as options for the treatment of VHD have extended to include high-risk and inoperable patients (most of whom now undergo 
transcatheter interventions), and low-risk and asymptomatic patients (who derive prognostic benefit from increasingly safe procedures). Despite significant accumulation of data concerning the 
management of VHD over the last two decades, many patients in 
daily practice have clinical characteristics that do not match those 
of participants included in clinical trials. The Heart Team approach 
is therefore particularly helpful when there is uncertainty or a lack 
of strong evidence. 
The Heart Team meeting facilitates balanced presentation of all 
appropriate options for medical, interventional, and surgical 
treatment, using tools and techniques for shared decision-making.

The patient’s preference plays a central role in this process, although 
the Heart Team recommendation should be based upon key objective 
medical considerations (particularly the relative risks and benefits of any 
procedure). 
Meetings should take place on a regular basis with standardized 
minimum datasets (to ensure that all relevant information is available) and appropriate administrative support (often provided by 
specialist nurses with expertise in the care of patients with VHD). 
In-person meetings of the full Heart Team may not be feasible for 
every patient, and local standardized protocols may be implemented to facilitate swift decision-making for specific cohorts (e.g. elderly TAVI candidates or young patients with BAV disease). Equally, 
the need for Heart Team evaluation should not paralyse clinical 
decision-making, and ad hoc discussions remain appropriate in urgent situations. 
Core members of the Heart Team include the cardiologist treating 
the patient (who is best placed to present their case and act as their advocate), specialists in advanced cardiovascular imaging and peri- 
procedural guiding,21,22 surgeons, and interventional cardiologists 
with training and expertise in surgical and transcatheter valve procedures. Specialized nursing personnel play an essential role to improve 
patient information and education, as well as co-ordinate work-up 
and management steps in high-volume centres (Figure 1; Table 5). 
Cardiologists with expertise in heart failure (HF) and electrophysiology, 
as well as geriatricians, cardiovascular anaesthetists, and intensivists involved in peri-procedural care, should also be available to facilitate the 
discussion of particularly complex clinical scenarios when needed (extended Heart Team) (Figure 1; Table 5). 
3.1.2. Procedural volume and clinical outcomes 
The correlation between high institutional (and individual operator) 
volume and best procedural outcomes is intuitive, yet complex. 
Nevertheless, there is evidence of such a relationship for many cardiovascular procedures including SAVR,23,24 surgical MV repair,25,26 mitral 
and tricuspid TEER,27–30 and TAVI (particularly in centres with an associated high-volume SAVR programme).31–33 Studies have shown 
that an annualized operator volume of approximately 25 surgical mitral 
valve procedures,26 50 TAVIs (∼100 per centre),33 a cumulative experience of ∼50 M-TEER procedures per operator/centre,27 and a 
site volume of more than 20 T-TEERs/year30 are associated with improved technical and clinical outcomes. Higher institutional surgical 
volume is associated with lower complication rates,34–36 improved 
management,37 and better infrastructural support.38,39 
National procedural activity varies widely between high-, middle-, and 
low-income countries,40 and it is therefore difficult to provide 
recommendations concerning the precise number of institutional or operator procedures that is required for high-quality care, excellent facilities, 
and processes. Instead, a network approach that highlights the importance 
of centres performing a high volume of procedures (e.g. based upon quartiles in individual countries or regions) seems more suitable, with complex 
procedures concentrated in the centres with the highest volumes (Table 6).

Internal quality assessment (see dedicated document concerning TAVI 
from the ESC41), systematic recording, and public availability of the volume 
and outcome data of the performed procedures are essential. Participation 
in national or international registries should be encouraged. These considerations are of particular importance regarding asymptomatic low-risk patients (where low mortality and procedural safety are paramount), those 
with multiple comorbidities (where the need for multidisciplinary collaboration is essential), and new techniques with a steep learning curve (where 
better results may be obtained at experienced centres). 
There is a pressing need to ensure higher dispersion and adoption of 
interventions for VHD, especially (but not exclusively) in middle- and 
lower-income countries where rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains 
the principal cause of VHD.42,43 Key strategies include awareness programmes, increased public and medical education, simplified and improved diagnostic tools, and measures to reduce costs and facilitate 
access to evidence-based treatment options.44 
4. Imaging of patients with valvular 
heart disease 
Multimodality imaging is now the standard approach in VHD 
management to determine the pathophysiology, assess severity, 
plan interventions, and identify complications (Figure 2). The use 
of imaging for the assessment of each specific valve lesion is described in the corresponding sections. The role of imaging is transversal from diagnosis to follow-up and should encompass an 
integrative assessment. 
4.1. Initial valve assessment 
Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first-line 
examination to confirm valve dysfunction, and determine the aetiology, 
mechanism, and severity of VHD, as well as cardiac chamber anatomy 
and damage.45,46 It should be performed by properly trained imagers.47–49 Quantitative imaging analysis (as opposed to visual) should 
be the goal in all patients with relevant VHD, complemented by qualitative and semi-quantitative evaluation. The severity of VHD should be 
assessed using an integrative approach of all criteria checked for consistency. When TTE is of poor quality or inconclusive, transoesophageal 
echocardiography (TOE) and/or additional diagnostic imaging modalities should be applied (e.g. calcium scoring and anatomy of the 
valve using CCT). In specific clinical scenarios [e.g. thrombosis, prosthetic valve dysfunction, endocarditis, mitral stenosis (MS), assessment 
of MV or TV anatomy], TOE has a central diagnostic role.50,51

Moreover, in patients with regurgitant lesions, particularly AR, CMR has 
gained key value in clinical practice. 
4.2. Associated diseases and conditions 
Imaging plays a crucial role in identifying associated diseases and conditions. The presence of concomitant left ventricular (LV) systolic or diastolic dysfunction, RV systolic dysfunction, red flags indicating 
cardiomyopathies (e.g. amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), 
and aortopathy should prompt further examinations to ensure optimal 
risk stratification and VHD management. In addition to TTE, advanced 
imaging modalities, like CCT, may be required to assess the aorta, 
single-photon emission computed tomography (CT) for detection of 
ischaemia/necrosis, positron emission tomography (PET) for inflammation, nuclear scintigraphy for cardiac amyloidosis, or CMR for tissue 
characterization. 
4.3. Evaluation of valvular heart disease 
dynamics and variability 
Serial imaging studies to detect changes over time, or variability due to 
haemodynamic conditions or initiation/up-titration of medical therapy, are of utmost importance to guide decisions. The dynamic pattern of VHD may convey additional prognostic information. 
Exercise echocardiography helps to identify the cause of dyspnoea, 
unveil symptoms in apparently asymptomatic patients, identifies dynamic changes of VHD severity, and can contribute to refinement 
of the indication for an intervention, especially for AS and mitral regurgitation (MR).52 
4.4. Assessment of extravalvular cardiac 
consequences from valvular heart disease 
Several studies investigating different valve lesions have established 
the relevance of extravalvular cardiac damage in terms of prognosis,53–55 recovery after intervention,56 and quality of life.57 The presence of LV hypertrophy, left atrium (LA) dilatation, LV or RV 
dysfunction and/or remodelling, myocardial fibrosis, and pulmonary 
hypertension (PH) provide important prognostic information, and 
may influence the timing and type of treatment. Although not necessarily chronological in their order of appearance, the understanding 
of cardiac damage, particularly damage involving the LV, is essential 
to guide appropriate medical therapy before and after any intervention. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) including global longitudinal strain (GLS) and CMR can be particularly useful in that 
regard.58–60 
4.5. Evaluation of eligibility, planning, and 
guiding of interventions 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) (preferentially 3D) is the 
preferred tool for the assessment of suitability for aortic, mitral, and 
TV repair.45,49,61–63 Risk stratification for an intervention should integrate all the points mentioned above. 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), including standard 3D 
views, is also the modality of choice to guide atrioventricular transcatheter interventions and should be performed by specially trained 
interventional echocardiographers.61,64 Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) is frequently used to evaluate the relationship of the 
valve with adjacent structures [e.g. coronary arteries and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT)], the extension of calcification [e.g. in mitral annular calcification (MAC)], and for sizing of the prosthesis. 
CT angiography is frequently employed to evaluate the anatomy 
of surgical, arterial, or venous access routes and detect cardiac or 
extracardiac complications (e.g. bleeding or embolic events). 
Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is increasingly utilized to assess 
the presence of CAD. 
5. Clinical evaluation of patients 
with valvular heart disease 
5.1. Clinical examination 
Patients with VHD can be either asymptomatic or present with a wide 
spectrum of symptoms, including acute or chronic HF. An initial meticulous history and a comprehensive physical examination of the patient 
with auscultation, documentation of clinical signs of HF such as dyspnoea, impaired physical capacity and fatigue, peripheral oedema, and 
pleural effusion, as well as a systematic frailty assessment, are crucial.65 
In addition, comorbidities and coexisting cardiac conditions should be 
documented (Figure 3). Particular attention should be given to recent 
changes in symptoms or physical findings indicating a potential worsening of the valve lesion or ventricular function. 
5.2. Assessment of comorbidities and risk 
stratification 
Risk stratification of patients with VHD has been mainly developed 
based on surgical populations. The European System for Cardiac 
Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II)66,67 (https://www. 
euroscore.org) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk 
of 
mortality 
(STS-PROM) 
score68 
(http://riskcalc.sts.org/ 
stswebriskcalc/calculate) are the most commonly used scoring systems 
to estimate surgical risk. Both risk scores have been calibrated to predict post-operative outcomes.69–71 The STS-PROM score is dynamic to 
account for changes in patient risk profiles, the type of procedure (aortic, mitral, and tricuspid), and outcomes over time. The outdated (logistic) EuroSCORE I model systematically overestimated surgical 
mortality.70,72 
In patients considered for TAVI, surgical risk scores have lower accuracy and tend to overestimate the risk of events.73–75 Discrepancies 
between observed and predicted peri-procedural mortality after 
TAVI using surgical risk scores point towards a need for 
TAVI-specific scores. Models predicting short- and medium-term survival specifically designed for TAVI are rarely used in daily clinical practice due to limitations of their predictive performance.76–79 Specific 
scores have also been developed for patients undergoing mitral 
TEER (M-TEER),80–82 but the high heterogeneity of the population 
with MR limits their external validity and therefore routine clinical 
use so far.83 Recently, a dedicated clinical score has been calibrated 
and validated to stratify the risk associated with first-time and repeat 
isolated TV surgery (TRI-SCORE; https://www.tri-score.com/), and its 
use should be encouraged for patients with TV disease,84,85 as an alternative to the more complex Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) 
score for isolated TV surgery (https://isolatedtvsurgcalc.research.sts. 
org/).

Other cardiac conditions and comorbidities—such as CAD, concomitant multiple valve and aortic disease, and RV dysfunction, as 
well as chronic kidney disease (CKD)—are not always appropriately 
captured in risk models, even if they are known to impact outcomes.86 
Similarly, specific unfavourable characteristics like porcelain aorta, mobile aortic atheroma, and previous mediastinal radiation therapy increase the surgical risk, and therefore may favour transcatheter 
treatment options. Frailty, including nutritional state, represents another 
important determinant of outcomes after valve interventions,87–89a 
which can be evaluated using appropriate tools as summarized in a recent consensus statement.90 Several methods have been proposed, 
from the simple Fried Frailty Index to more complex scores91 such 
as the Hospital Frailty Risk Score, which has been validated in a large 
cohort of TAVI and M-TEER patients.92 
The use of PROMs that engage patients in the co-evaluation of their 
health and wellbeing is encouraged. Several scoring systems have been 
proposed and validated for reproducibility and association with clinical 
outcomes, like the Quality of Recovery 15-item PROM or the Kansas 
City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).93–95 
5.3. Biomarkers 
Biomarker levels indicating either cardiac wall stress [e.g. brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)] or myocardial damage (e.g. troponin), in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, may help to monitor VHD 
progress and determine the most appropriate timing of intervention. 
In patients with VHD, the natriuretic peptide ratio [the ratio of 
measured BNP or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic protein

(NT-proBNP) to upper limit of normal for age, sex, and assay] 
has been shown to be a powerful, independent, and incremental 
predictor of mortality.96–98 In patients undergoing AV replacement, 
the accumulation of several elevated biomarkers of cardiovascular 
stress was associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and a higher rate of repeat hospitalization.99,100 
5.4. Exercise testing 
Because of the slow progression of valve lesions, patients may gradually 
limit their activity levels over several years and deny having actual symptoms that can be unmasked by exercise testing.12 This is particularly important in cases of AS, because once symptoms occur there is a sharp 
increase in the risk of sudden cardiac death, unless a valve intervention 
is performed.101–104 Exercise testing may provide additional information about the haemodynamic severity of VHD and help determine 
the risk and optimal timing of intervention by objectively evaluating 
functional capacity.101,103 Cardiopulmonary exercise testing has a 
prognostic role and can assist decision-making in patients with VHD 
of intermediate severity, particularly those with asymptomatic 
AR.101,105,106 
Exercise echocardiography is used for the assessment of LV global 
and segmental function, pulmonary artery pressure, and aortic and mitral pressure gradients.101,107 It also documents exercise-induced increase of MR and TR severity, especially in patients with secondary 
disease.108,109 Prognostic impact has been shown mainly for AS and 
MR.110,111 Misconceptions regarding its risk and tolerability contribute 
to the overall underuse of exercise testing in patients with VHD,12 despite data confirming its safety in most asymptomatic patients.112,113 
5.5. Invasive investigations 
5.5.1. Coronary angiography 
Coronary artery assessment is recommended to evaluate the need for 
revascularization when valve surgery or an intervention is planned. The 
information regarding the existence of concomitant CAD should be 
available at the time of Heart Team discussion. CCTA is recommended 
as an alternative to coronary angiography to rule out CAD in patients 
who are at low or moderate risk of obstructive CAD. 
Coronary blood flow and fractional flow reserve (FFR) are altered in 
the setting of concomitant VHD, and functional haemodynamic assessment of CAD in these patients is not well established.114–118 
5.5.2. Cardiac catheterization 
Right heart catheterization (RHC) should be performed in patients with 
equivocal echocardiographic findings, particularly those with MV disease, as well as in all candidates for the treatment of severe TR. In exceptional cases with unclear AS severity, it can be combined with 
measurements of the transaortic gradients allowing estimation of the 
aortic valve area (AVA). Right heart catheterization contributes to assess the repercussions of any left-sided VHD or LV impairment on 
the pulmonary circulation and right side of the heart. It provides information regarding volume state, cardiac output, and vascular resistance, 
differentiating between pre- and post-capillary PH, and should be ideally 
performed in euvolaemia. 
Measurements of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure v-wave 
can inform about MR severity, but are neither sensitive nor specific, 
and may also be increased if the compliance of the LA is reduced or 
in case of diastolic LV dysfunction, as in patients with MS or chronic 
HF.119 
Similarly, the height of the right atrium (RA) v-wave, and the pressure curve mimicking the RV pattern (‘ventricularization’ of the RA 
pressure), are signs of relevant TR, which are frequently accompanied by increased RV end-diastolic pressure in case of associated RV 
dysfunction. In patients with severe TR, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) should be calculated to unmask pulmonary vascular disease, which may not be captured by echocardiography due to RV 
systolic dysfunction or underestimation of pulmonary pressures because of TR. 
5.6. Patient-centred care and shared 
decision-making 
Given that treatment of VHD typically involves several modalities and 
specialities, and may result in a complex and sometimes time- 
consuming decision-making process, patient education and information, using online material and face-to-face conversations, are essential at each step. A clearly defined point of contact for all questions 
relating to the disease or type of treatments should be communicated 
to the patient and their relatives.120 The symptomatic and prognostic 
benefits, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of any treatment 
option, should be presented in an open and evidence-based manner. 
This includes mortality and risks of reintervention and complications 
(also over the long term), as well as recovery time and the need for 
cardiac, and if necessary psychological, rehabilitation until return to 
physical activity and work. Other issues to be discussed before the 
procedure include the need for oral anticoagulation (OAC) and its 
monitoring, as well as the noise generated by mechanical heart valves 
(MHVs). Information regarding centre experience and volume for a 
specific procedure should be provided. Misconceptions (e.g. subjective overestimation of the risk of surgery) should be addressed and potential interactions with individual lifestyle factors—including social 
activities, family and professional life, and hobbies—should be discussed in detail. 
The Heart Team recommendation regarding the treatment and its 
modality must be based on evidence and anatomical considerations, 
balancing the risks and benefits of available treatment options.16 The 
patient and patient’s relatives need to be well informed about the rationale leading to the Heart Team recommendation, and given ample 
time to share personal preferences.121 At the end of the process, a 
shared decision is made between the treating team and the informed 
patient and relatives (Figure 3). 
6. Management of conditions 
associated with valvular heart 
disease 
6.1. Diagnosis and management of 
coronary artery disease 
The presence of CAD plays an important role in decision-making 
regarding the timing and modality of treatment, and should be 
assessed before Heart Team discussion. In patients with a low 
or moderate pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD (≤50%), 
CCTA is recommended to rule out relevant CAD with high sensitivity.122–124 
Several studies have investigated the value of CCT angiography for 
CAD screening in elderly TAVI candidates. While sensitivity for the detection of obstructive CAD is high (95%–97%), specificity (68%–73%) is  
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               21

### Page 22

modest, mainly explained by the high prevalence of coronary artery calcification and AF in patients with severe AS, which limit imaging resolution and interpretability.125,126 If CCT angiography obtained during 
standard pre-TAVI evaluation is of sufficient quality to exclude relevant 
CAD, omission of invasive coronary angiography should be considered.125–129 
The value of invasive functional haemodynamic assessment of CAD 
in patients with severe AS may be limited, because AS impacts coronary 
haemodynamics. Therefore, caution is warranted in the interpretation 
of functional measurements in the presence of severe AS until more 
data are available.115,116 
Recommendations for the management of chronic CAD associated 
with VHD are provided below (Recommendation Table 1), as well as in 
dedicated guideline documents.6 The indications for coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) in patients undergoing surgery for the treatment of VHD are mainly based on observational data, which do not 
provide detailed information on the degree of stenosis and the complexity of CAD.130 It has been demonstrated that subendocardial blood 
flow in the myocardium improves early after SAVR, most likely due to 
improved cardiac output and reduction of LV wall stress.131 The presence of CAD is associated with peri-operative and late adverse events 
in patients with AS undergoing SAVR132 that likely outweigh the increased risk of peri-procedural adverse events of combined SAVR 
and CABG compared with isolated SAVR. Indeed, in a large observational study, patients with CAD demonstrated better long-term survival after combined SAVR and CABG compared with SAVR alone, 
despite longer cross-clamp times.133 In patients with a primary indication for valve surgery, CABG is recommended in patients with coronary artery stenosis of ≥70% and should be considered in those with 
stenosis of ≥50%–70%, given the opportunity of concomitant full 
revascularization. 
The impact of CAD in patients undergoing TAVI remains under investigation. The randomized Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention (NOTION)-3 
trial compared a strategy of routine percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus conservative management in 455 patients with severe 
symptomatic AS undergoing TAVI, who also had stable CAD and at 
least one stenosis of ≥90% based on visual angiographic assessment 
or FFR of ≤0.80 in a segment with ≥2.5 mm reference diameter.134 
Percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with lower risk 
of a composite endpoint event including all-cause death, myocardial infarction or urgent revascularization at a median follow-up of 2 years. 
Exploratory analyses suggest that the increased risk in the conservative treatment arm was driven by differences in the risk of myocardial 
infarction and urgent revascularization in patients with a diameter 
stenosis of ≥90%, rather than those with positive FFR and stenosis 
of <90%. The risk of bleeding was higher in the PCI than in the conservative 
treatment group. Another multicentre RCT, the PercutAneous Coronary 
inTervention prIor to transcatheter aortic VAlve implantaTION 
(ACTIVATION) trial, was discontinued due to slow recruitment.135 
In this underpowered and thus inconclusive trial, a routine PCI strategy 
of ≥70% stenoses in main epicardial vessels (or ≥50% if protected left 
main or vein graft) did not meet non-inferiority compared with conservative CAD treatment with respect to the composite of all-cause death and 
rehospitalization; moreover, PCI was associated with higher bleeding 
rates. Observational data show that TAVI can be performed safely in patients with untreated CAD with low short- and long-term rates of acute 
coronary syndrome and unplanned coronary revascularization.135–139 
In two recent meta-analyses of mostly observational data, PCI was not 
associated with a mortality benefit in patients with chronic CAD 
undergoing TAVI.140,141 
Optimal timing of PCI in patients undergoing TAVI remains yet to 
be determined. In NOTION-3, PCI was performed before TAVI in 
the majority of the patients (concomitantly or shortly after in only 
26% of the patients). Decision-making concerning the timing of 
PCI should take into account the type of valve used for TAVI and 
the complexity of the coronary lesions.142,143 Valves with a high 
frame—particularly in the context of a narrow aortic root, commissural misalignment, or valve-in-valve procedures—can pose challenges for coronary access following TAVI.144,145 The presence 
of significant CAD should therefore be considered for optimal 
transcatheter valve selection and reinforces the importance of optimized implantation technique and commissural alignment.143,146 
Several RCTs comparing the value and timing of PCI with 
medical therapy are ongoing (NCT04634240, NCT04310046, and 
NCT05078619). 
Based on the available data, PCI should be considered in patients with 
a primary indication to undergo TAVI and high-grade (≥90%) coronary 
artery stenosis in large vessels of ≥2.5 mm. In patients with stenosis of 
≥70%, PCI may be considered based on symptom status.142,143 In patients with ischaemic ventricular SMR, surgical revascularization of 
CAD has been associated with MR reduction147 and favourable clinical 
outcomes in observational studies.148,149 According to very limited 
data, improvement of SMR may occur in a minority of patients (about 
one-third) after PCI, which may therefore be considered prior to MV

For patients with VHD presenting with acute coronary syndrome, 
treatment decisions should be made according to the most recent 
ESC Guidelines.151 In patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, it may be particularly challenging to 
determine the leading cause of elevated troponin levels, which are 
also frequently observed in decompensated VHD. Therefore, the 
treatment strategy should be determined by the Heart Team, taking 
into account symptoms, as well as coronary, valve, and access 
anatomy.136,138,139

6.2. Atrial fibrillation 
The interplay between AF and VHD is complex, and has an essential 
role in the prognosis and evolution of VHD during the patient’s lifetime. 
Valvular heart disease is independently associated with AF and almost 
one-third of patients with AF have a history of VHD.152 Conversely, 
AF is the main trigger of the development of atrial secondary MR and 
TR. In a recent cohort study, 8% of individuals with AF developed moderate or severe TR within 3 years of follow-up compared with only 2% 
in those in sinus rhythm.153 While disturbed annular dynamics have 
been postulated,150,154 the exact pathophysiology leading to secondary 
atrioventricular VHD in some, but not all patients with AF remains 
largely unclear. 
Detailed recommendations on the anticoagulation management of 
patients with VHD and AF are provided below (Recommendation 
Table 2) and in Section 14, as well as in specific Guidelines.7 Patients 
with a combination of VHD and AF have a high incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding complications.155 DOACs have replaced vitamin K 
antagonists (VKAs) in most clinical scenarios and are recommended for 
patients with VHD presenting with AF, except for patients with a MHV 
or mitral stenosis with a valve area ≤2.0 cm2. The use of apixaban,156 
dabigatran,157 edoxaban,158 and rivaroxaban159 is supported by subgroup analyses of large RCTs. Recommendations regarding the antithrombotic treatment of patients with MHVs and biological heart valves 
(BHVs) are described in Section 14 of these Guidelines. 
In the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS) III trial, surgical left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in patients with AF and a 
CHA2DS2-VASc [congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, age ≥75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled), vascular disease, age 65–74, sex category (female)] score of ≥2 points 
undergoing cardiac surgery was associated with a 33% reduction of 
the risk of stroke or systemic embolism at a mean follow-up of 
3.8 years.160 These findings were confirmed by a large meta-analysis including four RCTs.161 A subanalysis of LAAOS III showed that the benefit of LAAO remains consistent irrespective of the use of VKAs or 
DOACs, as well as in the absence of OAC (although representing 
only 10% of the included population).162 In an RCT including patients 
with severe AS and AF undergoing TAVI, concomitant transcatheter 
LAAO was non-inferior to medical therapy with respect to a composite 
primary endpoint including all-cause mortality, stroke, and major bleeding at 2 years. Of note, rates of major or life-threatening bleeding were 
similar in the two groups and arterial or venous thromboembolisms 
more frequent in the TAVI/LAAO arm, leaving uncertainty regarding 
the usefulness of combining both procedures.163 
6.3. Cancer and radiation therapy 
Valvular heart disease is commonly associated with cancer and represents a well-known long-term side effect of intensive radiation therapy176 for treatment of Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast 
cancer, and other thoracic malignancies.177 Clinically significant VHD 
most commonly appears decades after radiotherapy. The incidence 
of radiation-induced VHD is increasing owing to longer survival of patients with cancer. Risk factors are summarized in Supplementary data 
online, Table S1. Patients at risk should be screened for VHD using TTE 
10 years after radiation exposure and followed up every 5 years 
thereafter.178

Radiotherapy may lead to aortic and/or valvular calcification, CAD of 
proximal segments, restrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial adhesions 
and calcifications with constriction, restrictive lung disease, chest wall 
scarring, and impaired wound healing, especially in patients who underwent radiation by means of older techniques (>20 years ago). The above 
factors complicate any surgical approach and increase the operative risk, 
which is underestimated by traditional risk scores.179–181 TAVI is proposed as an alternative for patients presenting with radiation-induced 
AS in the 2022 ESC Guidelines on cardio-oncology182 based on favourable, 
but limited, observational data,183,184 because this category of patients 
has been excluded from RCTs.183,184 Furthermore, M-TEER in patients 
presenting with radiation-induced MV disease with MR is often limited 
by thickened leaflets with restricted movement and subsequent risk of 
iatrogenic stenosis. 
In patients with active or stable cancer and severe AS, both TAVI and 
SAVR can be considered based on life expectancy, age, prognosis, and 
disability following cancer treatment, with a trend towards more TAVI 
utilization.185 TAVI procedural complication rates appear similar compared with those of control subjects without cancer.186 To avoid futility, treatment decisions discussed by the Heart Team should involve the 
treating oncologists.5,182 
6.4. Prophylaxis of rheumatic fever 
Rheumatic heart disease remains the most common cause of death 
from VHD worldwide.187 Prevention should preferentially target the 
first occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. Correct diagnosis and early 
antibiotic treatment of group A Streptococcus throat or skin infection 
is key for primary prevention. Large-scale screening combined with 
prophylaxis in children or adolescents with latent RHD appears to be 
an effective strategy to reduce the risk of disease progression and 
RHD prevalence.188–190 In patients with established RHD, secondary 
long-term prophylaxis with benzathine benzyl penicillin 1.2 million 
international units (IU) every 3–4 weeks over 10 years is recommended to prevent recurrent episodes, especially in children and adolescents. Long-term prophylaxis into adulthood should be considered 
in high-risk patients according to the severity of VHD and exposure 
to group A Streptococcus.191,192 
6.5. Cardiogenic shock and acute heart 
failure 
Acute presentation or decompensation of VHD can result in cardiogenic shock due to rapid haemodynamic deterioration and altered cardiac function. Alternatively, pre-existing VHD can be a bystander of an 
acute cardiovascular condition further exacerbating circulatory impairment until the occurrence of cardiogenic shock. In this setting, assessment of the severity of VHD, as well as its contribution to acute HF, 
may be difficult. Evidence concerning acute VHD management in this 
context is scarce and only exists for the MV and AV.193,194 
Hospital admission for acute decompensated AS is a frequent problem seen in up to 25% of AS hospitalizations.195,196 However, only a minority of these patients (1.6%–3.2%) present with cardiogenic 
shock.197,198 While intensive care treatment remains the cornerstone 
of haemodynamic stabilization and support, an intervention should be 
considered early, because it represents the only way to reverse progressive organ dysfunction due to low cardiac output. Balloon aortic 
valvuloplasty has been used in this context in the past, but has been 
largely replaced by TAVI in recent years, due to the high risk of severe 
AR and mortality in the acute setting.199–201 Several large observational 
studies have established the feasibility of TAVI in patients with 
cardiogenic shock with similar device success, even if LVEF is low, although 30-day mortality remains higher (13%–19%) compared with 
routine TAVI.194,197,198 Surgery represents the preferred treatment 
in patients with acute AR, while TAVI has only been described in individual cases or patients with a failed surgical valve (valve-in-valve). Fast 
pacing over a temporary pacemaker lead shortens the diastole and may 
temporarily improve haemodynamics until the intervention.5,8 
Except for papillary muscle rupture, acute PMR rarely leads to cardiogenic shock and may be best treated by surgical valve repair or replacement. In contrast, increasing evidence supports the use of 
M-TEER in patients with acute ventricular SMR, particularly following 
acute myocardial infarction, due to lower mortality compared with surgery or medical treatment in propensity-matched analyses.194,202,203 
This strategy might also be helpful to facilitate weaning from mechanical 
circulatory support. 
6.6. Palliative care 
In some patients with advanced VHD not qualifying for surgical or 
transcatheter therapies, medical HF treatment remains the only, and 
sometimes best, available option. These patients usually present late, 
have extensive cardiac damage, develop terminal HF during the natural 
evolution of VHD, and are ineligible for mechanical circulatory support 
or heart transplantation (HTx). Early implementation of expert multidisciplinary palliative and end-of-life care, with the support of HF specialists,204–206 reduces the number of hospitalizations and improves 
quality of life and symptom burden, in particular dyspnoea, pain, and 
anxiety.207 Continuous co-ordination between all involved subspecialties, and transparent communication with the patient and their relatives, are key to ensure high quality of care. 
7. Aortic regurgitation 
7.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Chronic AR is mainly due to intrinsic abnormalities of the AV cusps and/ 
or secondary to progressive dilatation of the aortic root and/or ascending aorta. In high-income countries, degenerative changes are the leading cause of AR, while RHD is more frequent in middle- and 
low-income countries.12 Acute presentations are usually related to infective endocarditis or extension of aortic dissection into the aortic 
root. Chronic pure severe AR is more frequent in men and is associated 
with BAV and concomitant dilatation of the aorta in more than one-half 
of cases.208 
7.2. Evaluation 
During stepwise AR evaluation, the following aspects should be addressed: the severity of AR, its mechanism, and aetiology; the haemodynamic impact on LV function and pulmonary pressure; and 
evaluation of the ascending aorta. While echocardiography is the first- 
line modality, CMR and CCT are more accurate for the measurement 
of specific parameters (Figure 4). The results of the evaluation need to 
take into consideration the haemodynamic condition of the patient, 
particularly the blood pressure (BP), since high pressures can lead to 
overestimation of the regurgitant volume (RVol). 
Assessment of AR severity with TTE follows an integrative approach 
considering qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative parameters, 
but remains challenging.45 Consequences of AR on LV size and function 
must be carefully assessed. Cut-offs for intervention are mostly 
based on two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic measurements. 
However, 3D echocardiography and CMR allow more accurate


<!-- PAGE 25 -->

### Page 25

evaluation of LV volumes and LVEF than 2D echocardiography, and are 
useful in borderline cases (Figure 4).45,209 Strain imaging can be helpful in 
identifying subclinical LV dysfunction209–211 and can therefore influence 
the optimal timing of intervention. Reduced longitudinal strain and contractile reserve at stress echocardiography,212 elevated biomarkers 
(BNP),213,214 and the presence of myocardial fibrosis detected by 
CMR need to be integrated in the decision-making process, even if 
not entirely validated yet.209 
Given its close relationship with AV function, accurate measurements of the aortic diameter are required at all levels: the annulus, 
sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, and ascending aorta.8,215,216 
The largest diameter is used to indicate the specific aortic phenotype: root phenotype, ascending phenotypes, and extended or 
mixed forms (see Supplementary data online, Figure S1).8 The mechanism of AR and aortic diameters determine suitability for AV sparing or repair.217,218

The morphology of the AV represents a critical aspect in the diagnosis and treatment of AR. Pure AR in the context of BAV uncommonly 
manifests with normal aortic diameters, being more often associated 
with a dilated ascending aorta and/or root. It is important to define 
the valve phenotype to determine the repair probability and long-term 
result of AV repair or AV-sparing procedures. The degree of symmetry 
is an important predictor of BAV reparability with better long-term results in more symmetric phenotypes.219–221 
7.3. Medical therapy 
Medical therapy, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors 
(ACE-Is) or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, may provide 
symptomatic improvement in individuals with chronic severe AR for 
whom surgery is not feasible or contraindicated. The value of ACE-Is 
or dihydropyridines in delaying surgery in the presence of moderate 
or severe AR in asymptomatic patients has not been established, and 
their use is not recommended for this indication. The use of beta- 
blockers increases the length of the diastole and therefore the RVol, 
and should be used with caution if indicated for another reason. 
However, beta-blockers can be used along with ACE-Is or angiotensin 
receptor blockers (ARBs) after surgery, if indicated (systolic HF or 
heart rate control).222,223 
7.4. Indications for intervention 
Acute severe AR usually requires immediate surgery depending on the 
aetiology, such as infective endocarditis or spontaneous, traumatic, 
or iatrogenic aortic dissection.5,8 Surgery for the treatment of chronic 
severe AR is indicated depending on symptoms and/or the effects of 
the RVol on LV size and function (see Recommendation Table 3 and  
Figure 5). The presence of associated aortic dilatation dictates surgery, 
irrespective of AR severity. When the patient is symptomatic and AR 
severe, surgery is recommended unless the anticipated surgical risk is 
prohibitive.224–228 Concomitant surgical treatment of severe AR 
is also recommended, irrespective of symptoms, in patients requiring 
CABG, ascending aorta surgery, or any other cardiac surgical 
procedures.229,230 
For the asymptomatic patient with severe AR, indications for 
surgery are based on the degree of functional impairment of the 
LV [LVEF ≤50%, left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD)  
>50 mm, or left ventricular end-systolic diameter indexed to body surface area (BSA) (LVESDi) >25 mm/m2, especially in those with small 
BSA (BSA <1.68 m2) and elderly patients with low ventricular compliance].226,228,231–234 If surgery is deemed low risk, there is observational 
evidence from echocardiographic studies that early intervention might 
be beneficial for long-term prognosis when LVEF is ≤55%, LVESDi is 
>22 mm/m2, and/or left ventricular end-systolic volume indexed to 
BSA (LVESVi) is >45 mL/m2.235–239 A volumetric cut-off value of 
LVESVi ≥43 mL/m2 using CMR was recently proposed to guide the 
management of asymptomatic patients240,241 and appears to have better predictive value than LV diameter.242 Surgery may also be discussed 
in selected low-risk asymptomatic patients with significant LV dilatation 
(left ventricular end-diastolic diameter >65 mm) and progressive increase of LV diameters and/or decrease of LVEF during follow-up. 
Exercise testing should be performed, when feasible, in patients with 
severe AR who do not report symptoms and do not meet criteria 
for surgery.212 
AV replacement is still the standard surgical approach in most AR 
cases (see Section 14.1 regarding prosthesis type considerations). 
However, owing to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of 
the aortic root (see Supplementary data online, Figure S1) paralleled 
with favourable long-term results, valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) and AV repair are increasingly performed in centres 
with appropriate expertise (Figure 5).243–255 In patients with root enlargement and good tissue quality (i.e. pliable AV cusps with normal motion), a valve-sparing procedure has been demonstrated to be superior 
to the use of a composite valve graft (Bentall procedure) in terms of 
long-term mortality and overall morbidity (thromboembolism and 
endocarditis, with similar need for reoperation),250–253,255–257 and 
should be therefore favoured by experienced centres, in particular 
in patients with an estimated long life expectancy.258 Valve preservation or valve repair should also be considered for patients with BAV 
based on age, anatomical presentation, and centre experience 
(Figure 5).220,245,246,259 
When performed by experienced surgeons in well-selected young 
individuals, pulmonary autograft implantation (Ross operation) may 
also be a good alternative to prosthetic valve replacement.260–263 
TAVI may be considered at experienced centres for selected patients 
with AR who are ineligible for surgery. The use of non-dedicated transcatheter valves for this indication is off-label and associated with an increased risk of valve malpositioning and residual AR, with consecutively 
higher rates of second valve implantation (about 10%) or surgical conversion, as compared with TAVI in AS.264–268 Dedicated devices appear 
to minimize the risk of valve migration and residual AR in selected patients, but are associated with a high new permanent pacemaker implantation rate (24%).267–269 
Aortic dilatation is closely linked to AR. Dedicated ESC Guidelines 
give guidance regarding the evaluation and management of aortic 
root and ascending aortic dilatation.8 The aortic phenotype (see  
Supplementary data online, Figure S1), degree and rate of progression 
of aortic dilatation, and the underlying aetiology all affect timing of surgery, with the main indication being maximum aortic diameter.270–272 
Dilation of the aortic root, which typically occurs in Marfan syndrome 
and other patients with connective tissue disease, has a worse prognosis compared with isolated dilatation of the ascending aorta and requires closer surveillance.270–272 Surgery is recommended in all 
patients with a maximal aortic root or ascending aneurysm diameter 
of ≥55 mm. In the presence of additional risk factors, a threshold of 
50 mm may be considered for selected low-risk patients treated at experienced centres.8 If the patient has an established indication for AV 
surgery (due to AR or AS), concomitant surgery of the aortic root 
or the ascending aorta should be considered at a diameter of 
≥45 mm. This threshold has been more clearly demonstrated in patients with BAV and should also be based on the patient’s height273 
or specific intraoperative findings, such as the shape and thickness of 
the aortic wall. 
7.5. Follow-up 
A multimodality imaging approach45,274 and biomarkers like BNP213,214 
might help identify patients at increased risk of LV damage early 
and guide the appropriate timing of intervention. Yearly follow-up is recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe AR. Closer follow- 
up (3–6 months) is recommended for those approaching thresholds 
for surgery, or showing a progressive dilatation of the LV or decrease 
of LVEF. Cardiac magnetic resonance can be especially useful in such 
a setting. Patients with moderate AR should be followed on a yearly basis, with echocardiography performed every 2 years. 
When a dilated ascending aorta is initially diagnosed by TTE, a multislice electrocardiographic-triggered CCT/CMR scan is recommended

to confirm maximal diameter, rule out isolated single sinus dilatation, 
and provide a baseline reference. When the baseline aortic diameter 
is >45 mm, a second TTE examination is recommended at 6 months 
to confirm the stability of the finding, followed by serial examinations 
on a yearly basis thereafter.275 Any increase of >3 mm should be validated by CT angiography/CMR and compared with baseline data.275 
After repair of the ascending aorta, patients with Marfan syndrome 
and other connective tissue diseases remain at risk for dissection of untreated portions of the aorta, and require lifelong regular multidisciplinary follow-up at an expert centre.8 
7.6. Special patient populations 
Patients with concomitant VHD and those with AS combined with AR 
are discussed in Section 13.3.3. In patients with moderate AR and indication for CABG or MV surgery, the decision to treat the AV should be 
discussed by the Heart Team based on the aetiology of AR and other 
clinical factors, like the estimated life expectancy and the operative risk, 
as data show that progression of moderate AR may be very slow.276 
The presence of aortic dilation and AR in asymptomatic patients 
poses the problem of limiting the level of physical activity, but consistent data are lacking. Current recommendations for participation in 
competitive sport are restrictive, especially regarding isometric exercise in patients with connective tissue disease,277 while a more liberal 
approach is likely to be appropriate in other patients. 
Given the familial risk of thoracic aortic aneurysms, screening with 
appropriate imaging studies and testing for genetic abnormalities in 
first-degree relatives is indicated in patients with connective tissue disease.278 Since aortic dilation is present in ∼10% of first-degree relatives 
of patients with a BAV, it is also considered appropriate to encourage 
echocardiographic screening in this specific population.275,279 
8. Aortic stenosis 
8.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Even if AS is the most common primary valve lesion referred for intervention in Europe and North America,12 underdiagnosis and undertreatment remain relevant concerns.10 Degenerative pathogenesis 
with cusps calcification is most common in developed countries and 
prevalence is rising rapidly because of the ageing population.11,12,187 
BAVs, or more rarely unicuspid AVs, are prone to earlier degeneration, 
constitute the dominant valve morphology in younger patients requiring AV replacement, and are frequently associated with dilatation of the 
aortic root or ascending aorta.280,281 In low- and middle-income countries, rheumatic aetiology remains frequent and AS usually presents 
combined with rheumatic MV disease.282 
8.2. Evaluation 
8.2.1. Echocardiography and cardiac computed 
tomography 
Aortic stenosis is a disease slowly evolving from mild to severe valve 
obstruction as a consequence of increasing valve fibrosis and calcification, although progression accelerates as haemodynamic severity 
increases.283 
Echocardiography is key to confirm the diagnosis and allows comprehensive assessment of the anatomy and severity of stenosis. Evaluation 
of the haemodynamic consequences on cardiac function and geometry, 
and the detection of aortic pathology or concomitant valve disease, 
provide important prognostic information that may influence management.284 Staging of extravalvular damage has been proposed,53 but 
it may be difficult to attribute other cardiac abnormalities to AS itself, 
because comorbidities are frequent in patients with AS and the 
observed damage may not occur in the expected chronological sequence. However, the detection of concomitant cardiac conditions 
[e.g. HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), amyloidosis, or hypertrophic

cardiomyopathy] may help to optimize medical treatment before and 
after valve intervention.285,286 
Current European recommendations for the echocardiographic 
grading of AS rely on measurement of the mean pressure gradient 
(most robust parameter), peak transvalvular velocity (Vmax), and effective AVA. Although AVA is theoretically the ideal parameter for assessing severity, there are numerous technical limitations associated with 
its calculation.284,287 
Aortic stenosis may be further categorized according to flow state 
based on stroke volume index (SVi) when there is discordance between 
echocardiographic parameters (Figure 6). A threshold of 35 mL/m2 is 
conventionally accepted to discern low from normal flow, although 
sex-specific thresholds have been proposed.292  
Concordant criteria: 
• High-gradient AS [mean gradient ≥40 mmHg, Vmax ≥4.0 m/s, AVA 
≤1 cm2 (or ≤0.6 cm2/m2)] is considered severe irrespective of LV 
function and flow conditions.  
Discordant criteria: 
• Low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced LVEF  
(mean gradient <40 mmHg, AVA ≤1 cm2, SVi ≤35 mL/m2, LVEF <50%). 
• Low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved LVEF  
(mean gradient <40 mmHg, AVA ≤1 cm2, SVi ≤35 mL/m2,  
LVEF ≥50%). 
• Normal-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved EF  
(mean gradient <40 mmHg, AVA ≤1 cm2, SVi >35 mL/m2,  
LVEF ≥50%). 
• Discordant high-gradient AS (mean gradient ≥40 mmHg,  
AVA >1 cm2).  
Patients with discordant normal-flow, low-gradient AS usually have 
moderate stenosis.293–295 Discordant high-gradient AS is considered 
severe if not caused by a reversible high-flow status.296–298 
In patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced LVEF, dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) can help to discriminate between pseudo-severe and true severe AS in the presence of flow 
reserve (increase in stroke volume of ≥20%).289,299 
Cardiac computed tomography calcium AV scoring is readily available and provides important adjunctive information in patients with 
low-flow, low-gradient AS because it correlates with haemodynamic 
severity, progression, and clinical outcomes.300,301 Values of >2000 
Agatston units (AU) in men and >1200 AU in women indicate severe 
AS with high sensitivity and specificity (∼85%).302,303 While higher 
thresholds (men >3000 AU, women >1600 AU) are very specific, severe AS becomes unlikely in patients with calcium AV scoring of 
<1600 AU in men and <800 AU in women.284,302,303 Cautious interpretation is required in patients who can develop severe AS without 
pronounced AV calcification such as in BAV, concomitant amyloidosis, 
and predominantly fibrotic stenosis associated with post-rheumatic, 
radiation-induced and inflammatory disease.304–308 
In low-flow, low gradient AS with reduced LVEF, CCT AV calcium 
scoring and DSE provide complementary information. If findings are 
equivocal, an integrated assessment considering all available clinical, 
morphological, and haemodynamic factors is required. 
8.2.2. Additional diagnostic and prognostic 
parameters 
The ratio of the LVOT to the AV Doppler jet velocity time integral 
(VTI, dimensionless index or velocity ratio) does not require 
calculation of LVOT area and may assist evaluation when other parameters are equivocal (<0.25 suggests that severe AS is highly likely).309 
Assessment of GLS can be useful for risk stratification310 and evaluation of extravalvular cardiac damage.311,312 It provides additional information regarding LV function and a threshold of −15% may contribute 
to identifying patients with severe asymptomatic AS at increased risk of 
clinical deterioration or premature mortality.59 
Estimated valvuloarterial impedance has been shown to be prognostic 
of adverse clinical outcomes before and after valve replacement.313–315 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) allows morphological 
evaluation of the valve, planimetry of AVA and assessment of potential subvalvular obstruction (unless there is acoustic shadowing caused by calcification), and evaluation of concomitant valve disease, and can be of value for 
peri-procedural imaging in challenging clinical or anatomical scenarios.316 
Natriuretic peptides can be used to arbitrate the sources of symptoms in patients with multiple potential causes and help to identify 
those with high-risk asymptomatic AS who may benefit from early 
intervention.97,317 
Exercise testing can unmask symptoms and haemodynamic intolerance 
(fall in BP >20 mm Hg) and is recommended for risk stratification in 
asymptomatic patients with severe AS.102,318 Exercise echocardiography 
may provide additional prognostic information by assessing the increase in 
mean pressure gradient and change in LV function.319 Cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing, eventually complemented by echocardiography, can 
help to uncover cardiac dysfunction in asymptomatic patients, discriminate cardiac from pulmonary limitation or deconditioning in patients with 
non-specific symptoms, and inform risk stratification.105,106,320,321 
Cardiac magnetic resonance is used to identify altered global LV 
geometry due to remodelling, as well as to quantify myocardial scarring 
and diffuse fibrosis, which are associated with the occurrence of adverse events.322–324 
Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis may coexist with AS in elderly patients and the two conditions may causally interrelate.325 When transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is suspected, the presence of monoclonal protein 
in serum and urine should be excluded using immunofixation and quantitative determination of free light chains, and diagnosis ascertained by 
means of diphosphonate scintigraphy.326 Despite the limited long-term 
prognosis associated with cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis, patients 
with concomitant severe AS usually benefit from valve intervention.327 
LV catheterization is not recommended unless there are symptoms 
and signs of severe AS, and non-invasive investigations are inconclusive. 
8.2.3. Procedural planning 
Cardiac computed tomography is key to determining suitability for 
TAVI and planning the procedure. It is the preferred imaging tool to assess AV anatomy including annulus size, dimensions of the aortic root 
and ascending aorta, the extent and distribution of valve and LVOT calcification, the distance of coronary ostia from the annular plane, optimal 
fluoroscopic projections for transcatheter valve deployment, and the 
feasibility of vascular access.49,328,329 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), which is more operator- 
dependent and does not allow assessment of coronary and peripheral 
vascular anatomy, or CMR may be considered when CCT is difficult to interpret or relatively contraindicated (e.g. in patients with renal failure).330,331 
8.3. Medical therapy 
No medical therapies have been shown to influence the natural 
history of AS to date. Neither statins, which demonstrated 
favourable effects in pre-clinical studies,332–334 nor substances

targeting calcification pathways alter disease progression.335,336 
Coexistent hypertension should be treated to avoid additional afterload, preferably using renin-angiotensin system blockers, although 
careful titration is required to avoid symptomatic hypotension.337 
In patients with symptomatic severe AS and HF, initiation of medical 
therapy or temporary improvement in symptoms should not delay 
intervention. Medication frequently requires re-adjustment following 
valve intervention and preventive therapies should be implemented 
according to current Guidelines.338 In patients with persisting HF 
and/or reduced LVEF, medical therapy should be introduced before 
and up-titrated after valve intervention according to the current HF 
Guidelines.339,340 
8.4. Indication for intervention 
8.4.1. Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis 
Symptomatic severe AS has an unfavourable prognosis if left untreated, 
and early intervention is strongly recommended in all patients with an 
estimated life expectancy exceeding 1 year10 (Figure 7). 
Intervention is recommended in all eligible symptomatic patients 
with high-gradient severe AS. However, management of patients with 
low-gradient AS is more challenging: 
• Low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced LVEF: reduced LV function usually improves after intervention if it is predominantly 
caused by excessive afterload.341–343 However, improvement is 
unlikely if the primary cause is fibrosis due to myocardial infarction 
or cardiomyopathy. Intervention is recommended when severe AS 
is confirmed by CCT (calcium scoring) or stress echocardiography,341 while patients with pseudo-severe AS should receive 
GDMT.339,344 Although the absence of flow reserve is associated 
with increased surgical and long-term mortality, both modes of 
intervention improved LVEF and clinical outcomes in observational 
studies.341,342,345–347 
• Low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved LVEF: outcomes are improved with intervention (either TAVI or SAVR) compared with 
medical treatment alone in patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS 
and preserved LVEF.348,349 Intervention should therefore be considered in patients with symptoms after careful confirmation that AS is 
severe. 
• Normal-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved LVEF: prognosis 
of these patients is similar to that of moderate AS. Unless 
multimodality diagnostic evaluation clearly suggests severe 
AS, regular clinical and echocardiographic surveillance is 
recommended.293,294,350  
8.4.2. Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis 
Up to 40% of patients with severe AS do not report symptoms at the 
time of diagnosis.351,352 In roughly one-third of these, exercise testing 
can uncover symptoms or reduced exercise capacity attributable to 
AS,102,103,318 and such patients should be treated as symptomatic. 
However, exercise testing is not always feasible because of frailty or impaired mobility.353 Intervention is recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe AS and an LVEF of <50% without another 
cause.14,102,318,319,354–360 For patients with severe high-gradient AS 
and no adverse prognostic features, close active clinical surveillance, 
so-called ‘watchful waiting’, has previously been the default management strategy. However, four RCTs comparing early AV intervention 
with clinical surveillance suggest that early intervention should be 
considered as an alternative in patients at low procedural risk.360–363 
This approach is reinforced if additional adverse prognostic features 
(very high Vmax,14,353,364 elevated natriuretic peptides,97,317,365,366 severe valve calcification,303,364 rapid Vmax progression,353,364 or LVEF 
of <55%14,354,356–359) are present. Restricted local resources (that 
may impede close surveillance) or long waiting lists (that preclude 
prompt treatment when symptoms develop) are further arguments favouring an early intervention. 
The Evaluation of TAVR Compared to Surveillance for Patients with 
Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis (EARLY TAVR) trial360 randomized 901 patients to early TAVI or clinical surveillance and demonstrated 
a reduction of 50% in the primary composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, stroke, or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular causes associated with pre-emptive intervention.360 The result was driven by 26.2% 
of the patients in the clinical surveillance group who converted to TAVI 
within 6 months of randomization due to the development of symptoms 
or adverse prognostic factors. There was no significant difference in 
strokes and all-cause mortality over 5-year follow-up. 
In the Early Valve Replacement Guided by Biomarkers of LV 
Decompensation in Asymptomatic Patients with Severe AS 
(EVoLVeD) RCT, which included 224 asymptomatic patients with severe AS and myocardial fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement on 
CMR), early valve intervention (with SAVR or TAVI) failed to reduce 
the incidence of all-cause death or unplanned AS-related hospitalization 
compared with clinical surveillance.361 However, the study was underpowered and the median time to intervention was prolonged to 
5 months in the experimental arm. 
Two previous smaller trials compared early SAVR with clinical 
surveillance. In the Randomized Comparison of Early Surgery vs 
Conventional 
Treatment 
in 
Very 
Severe 
Aortic 
Stenosis 
(RECOVERY) trial (145 patients), there was a reduction in all-cause 
mortality following early SAVR over a mean follow-up of 6.2 years.362 
In the Aortic Valve Replacement Versus Conservative Treatment 
in Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis (AVATAR) trial (157 
patients), a reduction in the composite primary endpoint was noted 
after a mean follow-up of 2.5 years with a significant reduction in 
HF hospitalizations and mortality at long-term follow-up.363,367 
Limitations of these surgical studies included their small sample sizes, 
enrolment of selected young populations at low surgical risk (mean 
ages 64 and 67 years, respectively), and inclusion of patients with mostly very severe AS. 
A meta-analysis of the four RCTs showed that early intervention is 
associated with a significant reduction in unplanned cardiovascular or 
HF hospitalization and stroke, but not all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Limitations of this analysis include the heterogeneity of the 
pooled trials and lack of granularity with respect to specific events owing to the study-level analysis.368 
Additional RCTs (NCT04204915 and NCT03972644) will further 
inform and refine the management of patients with severe asymptomatic AS. 
8.4.3. Moderate aortic stenosis 
Surgical intervention for moderate AS should only be performed in patients undergoing CABG,369 surgery of the ascending aorta or other 
valve disease (see Section 13). There is evidence of an association between moderate AS and adverse outcomes in patients with and without HF with reduced EF (HFrEF),370–372 but it is unknown whether 
this is causal or related to comorbidities. In an early terminated trial randomizing 178 patients with moderate AS and HFrEF to TAVI or clinical 
surveillance, no differences with respect to hard clinical endpoints were

found, while patients undergoing TAVI had improved quality of 
life (change in KCCQ of 12.8 ± 21.9 points vs 3.2 ± 22.8 points; 
P = 0.018).373 Ongoing trials are expected to provide new insights 
(NCT04889872 and NCT05149755). 
8.5. Treatment options 
The mode of AV intervention depends on the estimated life expectancy, expected prosthesis durability, patient preference, and specific 
trade-offs associated with different treatment options (Figure 8). 
Most patients with AS undergoing valve intervention in Europe and 
North America receive a BHV (by either SAVR or TAVI).374 BHVs 
do not require long-term anticoagulation but have limited durability 
that varies between devices and is inversely associated with age.375 
MHVs are durable but require long-term anticoagulation, with associated thromboembolic and bleeding risks.260,376 In general, an MHV 
should be preferred in patients aged <60 years and a BHV in patients 
aged >65 years in aortic position (see Section 14.1). 
The Ross procedure (replacement of the AV with the patient’s pulmonary autograft combined with homograft pulmonary valve 
replacement) is associated with excellent long-term survival when performed in selected patients at centres with high expertise.260,263,377,378 
Although a valuable surgical option in young patients with prolonged life 
expectancy in whom anticoagulation is undesirable or contraindicated, 
it is associated with procedural complexity and the need for reintervention in ∼15% of patients within 15 years (Figure 8).263,377 
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty may be rarely considered as a bridge to 
TAVI or SAVR in carefully selected patients with decompensated AS, 
and in those with severe AS who require urgent high-risk non-cardiac 
surgery (NCS) (see Section 15.2.1). The procedure carries significant 
risks of acute complications.379 
A substantial increase in the number of patients undergoing AV intervention has been observed over the past decade as a consequence of the 
introduction of TAVI, improved diagnostic techniques, and evolving indications for intervention.374,380–383 Nevertheless, there is still wide variation in worldwide access to TAVI as a result of high device costs in 
comparison with surgical prostheses and variation in healthcare resources and reimbursement systems between countries.384–386 In addition, registries suggest that late referral and undertreatment remain 
frequent.12,387 
8.5.1. The mode of intervention in candidates for a 
bioprosthesis 
The two modes of BHV replacement, TAVI and SAVR, have been compared in RCTs across the spectrum of surgical risk in predominantly 
elderly patients with tricuspid AS. 
In patients unsuitable for surgery, TAVI was superior to medical 
therapy with a number-needed-to-treat of five to prevent one death 
at 1-year follow-up.388 Subsequently, RCTs showed non-inferiority of 
TAVI compared with SAVR in patients at high,389–391 intermediate,3,392,393 and low surgical risk,1,394,395 with comparable longer-term 
outcomes demonstrated during follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 
10 years.2,4,396–398 Of note, the majority of patients included in 
RCTs were male, while patients with low-flow low-gradient AS or adverse anatomical characteristics (including BAVs or complex CAD) 
were excluded per protocol. 
Meta-analyses of RCTs show a risk reduction in all-cause death and 
disabling stroke with TAVI in low-risk patients at 1 year, but no differences to SAVR at longer-term follow-up or in patients at intermediate 
or high surgical risk.399,400 The early benefit of TAVI in low-risk patients 
has since been corroborated in the investigator-initiated Randomized, 
Multicenter, Event-Driven Trial of TAVI vs SAVR in Patients with 
Symptomatic Severe Aortic-Valve Stenosis (DEDICATE), which met 
its non-inferiority target with a composite of death and stroke rate at 
1 year of 5.4% in the TAVI group vs 10.0% in the SAVR group [hazard 
ratio (HR), 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35–0.79] and all- 
cause death rates of 2.6% and 6.2% (HR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24–0.73), 
respectively.395 
Rates of vascular complications and paravalvular leak (PVL) are consistently higher after TAVI despite refined transcatheter heart valve 
(THV) designs, whereas severe bleeding, acute kidney injury, and new- 
onset AF are more frequent after SAVR.2,4,399,401 Even though PVL has 
been associated with adverse clinical outcomes,402,403 it does not seem 
to impact the comparison of clinical outcomes between TAVI and 
SAVR in RCTs.2,4,395 
New pacemaker implantations are more frequent after TAVI, particularly when using self-expanding valves.3,394,404 Conflicting data exist 
regarding the long-term impact of new pacemaker implantation or 
new-onset left bundle branch block following AV intervention.405–407 
Patients undergoing TAVI have quicker recoveries, shorter hospital

stays, and more rapid improvements in quality of life compared with 
those who undergo SAVR.1,2,408,409 
Available data do not suggest systematic differences in durability between the two treatment modalities. Randomized controlled trials and 
observational studies have reported comparable rates of BHV failure related to SVD with transcatheter and surgical valves up to 10 years.2,398,410 
However, potential selection and survival bias, the use of variable definitions of SVD, limited follow-up durations, differential attrition 
rates,2,4,396,400 competing risk of death, and the use of multiple valve 
types in the surgical arms of RCTs may limit direct comparison.411 
Although conclusive evidence is still lacking, concomitant non- 
complex CAD can be addressed either by CABG or PCI, while 
complex CAD favours CABG (see Section 6.1). In the only RCT comparing these two strategies, the transcatheter valve and vessels 
(TCW) trial, randomization of patients with severe AS and concomitant CAD to FFR-guided PCI plus TAVI resulted in fewer deaths and 
major bleeding events compared with combined SAVR plus CABG at 
12 months.412 However, inferences from trial results are limited due 
to early termination, modest sample sizes, event rates deviating from 
those observed in registries and other RCTs, and a low prevalence of 
complex CAD. 
8.5.1.1. Age and life expectancy 
The relationship between estimated life expectancy and prosthetic heart 
valve durability determines the likelihood of a future reintervention. 
Although life expectancy may be a theoretically better guide than age 
alone for treatment decisions, it is difficult to estimate for an individual patient owing to large geographical (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ 
ihme-data/gbd-2019-life-tables-1950-2019) and interindividual variability.413 In combination with cardiac and extracardiac comorbidities, as 
well as anatomical factors, age contributes to risk estimation and represents a pragmatic surrogate for life expectancy. In addition, age thresholds 
characterize the populations enrolled in RCTs better than life expectancy. 
It is notable that younger patients with AS seem to have lower life expectancy than the general population despite valve replacement, whereas life 
expectancy almost normalizes after treatment in older cohorts.414,415 
While several trials compared TAVI with SAVR in study populations 
aged 70–85 years accross the surgical risk spectrum, the representation 
of patients aged <70 years in RCTs is low and therefore evidence 
limited.1,394,395,416 
8.5.1.2. Anatomical features 
The advantages of TAVI demonstrated in RCTs are largely confined to 
patients treated via the transfemoral approach.401 While SAVR remains 
the preferred treatment option when iliofemoral artery disease precludes transfemoral TAVI, TAVI via a non-transfemoral access (transaxillary, transcarotid, transcaval, transinnominate, or transapical) 
constitutes an alternative supported by observational data in patients 
unsuitable for surgery.417–423 
Other anatomical factors that favour SAVR or led to exclusion of patients from RCTs comparing TAVI with SAVR are  (Figure 9): 
• Aortic annular dimensions that lie outside sizing recommendations 
for currently available transcatheter devices. 
• Excessive or bulky calcifications of the annulus or LVOT, which increase the risk of PVL and annular rupture.424,425 
• Increased risk of coronary obstruction with TAVI (cusp height greater 
than coronary height in combination with shallow sinuses of Valsalva, 
or high calcium burden of corresponding cusp).329 
In contrast, anatomical findings such as porcelain aorta, severe chest 
deformation, or intact grafts post-CABG favour TAVI. Right anterior 
thoracotomy or upper hemisternotomy are minimally invasive access 
alternatives to sternotomy for performing SAVR, which are being 
used with increasing frequency.426,427 
In BAV patients, severe AS usually occurs earlier compared with tricuspid AV and is frequently associated with aortopathy.219,281,428 
Prevalence of BAV anatomy sharply increases in younger AS patients.429 BAV anatomy adds complexity to TAVI because of asymmetric AV calcification and elliptical annular shape, as well as the lack of 
standardization of valve sizing. 
Patients with BAV have been excluded from almost all landmark 
RCTs comparing TAVI with SAVR to date.429,430 In the NOTION 2 
trial, the composite of all-cause death, stroke, or valve- or HF-related 
rehospitalization was numerically more frequent (seven vs two events) 
at 1 year in the underpowered subgroup of 100 patients with BAV (HR, 
3.8; 95% CI, 0.8–18.5; P = 0.07).416 Whereas some observational studies 
report favourable outcomes with TAVI in selected BAV patients,430–432 
others suggest higher stroke, annular rupture, and PVL rates as compared with TAVI in tricuspid AS.433 Heavy cusp calcification, particularly 
in conjunction with a calcified raphe, is associated with increased risk 
of aortic root injury, PVL, and mortality after TAVI.434 Data on TAVI 
in two-sinus BAV (Sievers type 0) are scarce.219,435 
For the above-mentioned reasons, SAVR remains the primary mode 
of treatment for stenotic BAV, particularly if patients are young or have 
coexistent aortopathy or unfavourable valve morphology. TAVI may be 
considered in patients at increased surgical risk, if anatomy is suitable. 
Patients with small annuli in relation to their body stature are at increased risk of prosthesis–patient mismatch (PPM) after valve replacement. Annular enlargement allows for implantation of larger BHVs 
with SAVR. Given its technical complexity it should be performed 
in experienced centres, and the benefit must be balanced against a 
possibly higher risk of operative mortality.436 Prostheses with 
supra-annular design reduce PPM risk with TAVI, although randomized 
long-term data evaluating the impact on clinical outcomes or valve 
durability are pending.394,437,438 
8.5.1.3. Lifetime management 
Decision-making concerning the mode of intervention and type of 
prosthesis needs to integrate expected valve durability, and the potential risks of future reinterventions (Figure 9). Surgical THV explantation 
followed by SAVR is a rare (<1% of all TAVI procedures) but technically 
challenging procedure.439–441 Although its incidence among patients 
undergoing TAVI is stable, absolute numbers are increasing due to 
the total increase in TAVI procedures performed and the peri- 
operative risk remains high (early mortality rates as high as 12%– 
17%).440–445 The majority of surgical THV explantations are performed 
in patients at high surgical risk with urgent or emergent, 
non-SVD-related indication for reintervention (frequently endocarditis) within 2 years after TAVI.440,442–444 
Implanting a transcatheter aortic valve inside a surgical (TAV-in-SAV) 
or prior transcatheter valve (TAV-in-TAV) is associated with lower 
peri-procedural risk compared with redo SAVR.446–451 However, 
valve-in-valve implantation (particularly TAV-in-SAV) increases the 
risk of severe PPM,448 which has been linked to adverse outcomes in 
observational studies.452–455 In addition, valve-in-valve implantation immobilizes the leaflets of the failed prosthesis in an open position, creating a covered tube (or neo-skirt) that may cause direct coronary 
obstruction in patients with shallow sinuses of Valsalva or indirect


<!-- PAGE 35 -->

### Page 35

coronary flow obstruction as a result of sinus sequestration if the ascending aorta is narrow and the neo-skirt reaches the sinotubular 
junction.456,457 
The risk of coronary obstruction varies considerably depending on 
the index valve type, and is particularly increased if a stentless SAV or 
stented SAV with externally mounted leaflets is in place.457 The risk 
of sinus sequestration at the time of TAV-in-TAV implantation is particularly increased in supra-annular valves with a high neo-skirt.458,459 
Even if coronary flow is preserved, coronary access may be difficult 
or impossible in a relevant proportion of patients after valve-in-valve 
implantation, especially after TAV-in-TAV.460–462 
In patients who require a reintervention due to dysfunction of a surgical or transcatheter bioprosthesis, but are at increased risk of severe 
PPM or coronary obstruction, redo SAVR may be preferable despite 
the increased surgical risk. Fracture of surgical valves and leaflet modification techniques have been proposed for patients at high surgical risk 
and, if contemplated, should be performed in carefully selected patients 
at experienced centres (Table 6).463,464 
The need for a meticulous CT-based anatomical analysis is paramount in patients with an estimated life expectancy exceeding the 
assumed valve durability to anticipate future risks at the time of 
the index valve intervention. Based on individual assessment, the 
following measures should be considered with respect to lifetime 
management: 
• Use of surgical and transcatheter valves with proven long-term durability to reduce the likelihood of reintervention.2,4,375,410,411,465–467 
• SAVR with aortic root enlargement or implantation of a supra-annular 
transcatheter valve in patients with a small annulus at risk of severe 
PPM based on the predicted effective orifice area (EOA).436,438,468,469 
• No implantation of stentless prostheses or prostheses with externally mounted leaflets in patients at risk of coronary obstruction during 
future TAV-in-SAV implantation.457

• Anticipation of the feasibility and risks of a possible future TAV-in-TAV 
procedure considering related technical aspects at the index TAVI 
(device choice, neo-skirt height, commissural alignment, and implantation depth).456,470  
Considering life-time management aspects and the scarcity of randomized data in patients younger than 70 years, SAVR remains the preferred treatment in patients <70 years of age if surgical risk is low. 
TAVI is recommended as the primary treatment modality in elderly patients ≥70 years of age with a tricuspid AV, if anatomy is suitable and 
transfemoral access is feasible, to reduce the risk of early adverse outcomes and accelerate recovery. 
For all other candidates for a bioprosthesis, the most appropriate 
mode of intervention should be carefully selected by the Heart 
Team, taking into account procedural risk based on anatomical characteristics and comorbidities, expected outcomes, lifetime management 
considerations, and patient preference (Figure 9; Recommendation 
Table 4). Recommendations for concomitant valve replacement at 
the time of CABG or ascending aortic surgery are listed in

8.6. Follow-up 
The rate of progression of AS varies widely and asymptomatic patients, 
their family, and medical caregivers need careful education, with particular emphasis on the importance of regular follow-up (ideally at a Heart 
Valve Centre)14 and prompt reporting of symptoms. Asymptomatic patients with severe AS should be followed up at least every 6 months to 
allow detection of early symptoms (using exercise testing if complaints 
are inconclusive) and any change in echocardiographic parameters (particularly LVEF). Serial measurements of natriuretic peptides can provide 
additional useful information regarding the timing of treatment. 
Younger patients with mild AS and no significant leaflet calcification 
may be followed up every 2–3 years. With increasing stenosis severity, 
progression accelerates and follow-up intervals should be gradually reduced.283,503 Several studies suggest that the prognosis of moderate degenerative AS is worse than previously considered,504,505 particularly if 
there is significant valve calcification, and these patients should be re- 
evaluated at least annually. 
Cardiac rehabilitation is frequently performed after AV intervention, 
especially after surgery and in elderly patients, and is associated with improved activities of daily living and 6-minute walking distance.506 After 
valve intervention, an early echocardiographic examination within the 
first weeks after valve replacement is recommended to document baseline prosthetic valve function. Cardiological evaluations and echocardiographic examinations are recommended annually in patients with a 
bioprosthesis, and whenever changes in clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of valve dysfunction are noted. 
9. Mitral regurgitation 
Chronic MR is one of the most common acquired valve pathologies,12,187 while acute MR is observed in the context of infective endocarditis, chordal rupture, or as a complication of myocardial infarction 
(papillary muscle rupture). MR either relates to anatomical changes of 
the MV apparatus (primary), or to LV or LA dilatation and dysfunction 
(secondary).193 Since natural history, prognosis, and management differ 
according to aetiologies, populations should be clearly distinguished in 
clinical practice and research.12,507 
9.1. Primary mitral regurgitation 
9.1.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Primary mitral regurgitation relates to an anatomical lesion of one or 
more of the three main components (not including the annulus) of the 
MV apparatus (valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles). 
PMR is observed in 55% of patients with MR who require treatment.507 
While degenerative disease related to fibroelastic deficiency or myxomatous alterations (in its most severe form, Barlow’s disease) are the most 
common aetiologies in higher-income countries, RHD is most frequently 
found in the rest of the world. MV endocarditis is a separate entity of PMR 
caused by acute or chronic infectious conditions and is discussed in the 
corresponding Guidelines.5 In a small subgroup of patients, PMR is associated with a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death has been reported in individual cases, especially in patients with 
Barlow’s disease.508 The arrhythmogenic burden is independent from MR 
severity and has been associated with mitral annular disjunction. Atrial displacement of the posterior MV leaflet hinge point is assumed to cause excessive mobility of the valvular apparatus and increases tension on the 
papillary muscles and the posterobasal myocardium, causing local fibrosis, 
which may lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.509 
9.1.2. Evaluation 
9.1.2.1. Echocardiography and right heart catheterization 
Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice for the quantification of MR, determination of its aetiology, and identification of cardiac 
consequences (Figure 10). TTE is used for initial evaluation that includes: 
(i) assessment of valve morphology (presence and location of prolapse 
or flail, calcifications, and/or mitral annular disjunction); (ii) integrative 
severity grading; and (iii) quantification of LV and LA dimensions and 
function, as well as assessment of concomitant RV dysfunction.46 
Quantitative parameters such as the effective regurgitant orifice area 
(EROA) have prognostic implications.510,511 Volumetric methods provide additional information on MR severity [RVol and regurgitant fraction (RF)].512 Accurate colour flow settings must be used to avoid 
overestimation of MR severity. 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) represents the method of 
choice to assess valve anatomy, leaflet quality, motion, and coaptation, as 
well as to confirm MR severity.513 Three-dimensional TOE provides an 
excellent morphological and functional view of the different valve segments, and should be used systematically when planning and performing 
surgical or transcatheter repair.514 
Exercise echocardiography evaluates dynamic changes in regurgitant jet 
and pulmonary pressures during peak exercise, and might be helpful in patients with discordant symptoms and regurgitation severity at rest.515,516 
In asymptomatic patients with severe PMR, increased LV or LA dimensions, as well as elevated pulmonary pressures (>50 mmHg at 
rest), moderate or more secondary TR, and AF are important markers 
of worse prognosis, and should be considered for intervention timing 
(Figure 11; Section 9.1.4).517,518 
Right heart catheterization remains important in patients with PMR 
for confirmation of pulmonary artery pressures in case of discrepancy 
between echocardiographic MR severity and clinical symptoms, as well 
as in the presence of concomitant lung disease.519 
9.1.2.2. Biomarkers 
Cardiac biomarkers are recognized indicators of disease 
severity with prognostic implications, but may also be non- 
specific. NT-proBNP levels are directly related to the 
New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in PMR.520

In a multicentre registry including more than 1300 patients with PMR, 
increased BNP level was an independent predictor of long-term mortality under medical treatment. However, pre-operative BNP activation 
did not impact long-term mortality after surgical treatment.96 
9.1.2.3. Cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography 
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is an alternative to precisely quantify RVol and RF in cases of inconclusive or discordant measurements, 
and the gold standard to determine cardiac dimensions and chamber 
volumes.521,522 The combination of planimetered volumetric methods 
and phase contrast measurement of the MV inflow are used for this 
purpose.523 In patients with Barlow’s disease and mitral annular disjunction, CMR-detected myocardial fibrosis524 has been associated with 
ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.525 
Cardiac computed tomography provides high-resolution anatomical 
details of the entire MV apparatus523,526 and increasingly plays a role in 
MV intervention planning, particularly in the assessment of arterial access 
for extracorporeal circulation and the presence of MV calcification in minimally invasive surgery,527 as well as the feasibility of transcatheter MV implantation (TMVI) based on annulus size and risk of LVOT obstruction.528

Due its high sensitivity for detection of calcifications, CCT is instrumental for procedural planning (surgical and transcatheter) in patients 
with MAC.529 
9.1.2.4. Genetic evaluation 
There is increasing evidence that specific mitral pathologies may be associated with genetic conditions. A meta-analysis of six genome-wide 
association studies identified 14 potential genetic loci associated with 
primary MR. By comprising epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic 
data, the following genes could be identified as potential genetic sources 
of the pathology: LMCD1, SPTBN1, LTBP2, TGFB2, NMB, and ALPK3.530 
However, genetic testing is not recommended in routine practice. 
9.1.3. Medical therapy 
Medical therapy has a limited role in patients with PMR. Afterload reduction with sodium nitroprusside has been used as a bridge to an 
intervention in patients with acute severe PMR without signs of hypotension. Inotropic agents and diuretics are usually indicated to reduce 
filling pressures and control pulmonary congestion, while the implantation of an intra-aortic balloon pump helps to further reduce afterload 
in exceptional cases of acute PMR. 
In chronic PMR without signs of LV dysfunction or criteria for an 
intervention, there is no evidence supporting prophylactic afterload reduction. Patients with PMR and impaired LV function should receive 
GDMT according to HF Guidelines.340 
9.1.4. Indications for intervention 
Urgent surgery or transcatheter treatment is indicated in patients with 
acute severe PMR because it is poorly haemodynamically tolerated. In patients with papillary muscle rupture and endocarditis, surgical valve replacement is generally required, while acute degenerative chordal rupture can be 
treated with surgical MV repair or TEER in high-risk patients. 
Indications for surgery in patients with chronic asymptomatic and 
symptomatic PMR are summarized in Recommendation Table 6 and  
Figure 11. In cases of severe PMR, restoring the anatomy by surgical 
MV repair, including annuloplasty, is the treatment of choice in operable 
patients when an optimal and durable result is expected. According 
to contemporary data, the procedure can be performed with 
a low mortality risk (1.2%) in appropriately selected patients.531 
Compared with replacement, MV repair has been associated with 
lower peri-operative mortality along with significantly better long- 
term survival and functional outcomes.532,533 Repair of more complex pathologies such as valves with annular or leaflet calcifications, 
as well as in cases of RHD, is challenging and should be attempted in 
experienced Heart Valve Centres.534–536 When MV repair is not 
feasible, valve replacement with preservation of the subvalvular apparatus should be performed.537 
High-risk and elderly patients with chronic PMR, though uncommon, 
may benefit from a less-invasive M-TEER procedure.538 Peri- 
interventional and mid-term results with regard to residual MR and 
mean transmitral gradient are closely related to patient outcomes.538 
The use of latest-generation devices along with a growing team experience have improved results, and allow for the successful treatment 
of more complex anatomical conditions (Supplementary data online,  
Table S2).539,540 The decision regarding the mode of intervention or 
conservative treatment should be made by the Heart Team, considering 
clinical and anatomical characteristics, as well as procedural risks and 
patient preference. The longer-term efficacy of TEER compared with 
surgery is still under investigation in high- (NCT03271762) and 
intermediate-risk PMR patients (NCT04198870), as well as in 
all-risk-category patients >60 years of age (NCT05051033).541 TMVI 
is very effective in abolishing MR in selected high-risk patients, particularly those with complex MV anatomy for TEER (Supplementary data 
online, Table S2).542,543 The major drawbacks of current TMVI systems 
include limited availability, high screening failure rate, as well as the risk of 
LVOT obstruction and valve thrombosis. Limited data exist for PMR patients and regarding mid-term prosthesis durability. 
In patients with asymptomatic PMR with signs of LV dysfunction 
(i.e. LVEF ≤60%, LVESD ≥40 mm, or LVESDi ≥20 mm/m2) the benefit of early surgery is well established.544–546 Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the presence of LA dilatation [LA volume index 
(LAVI) ≥60 mL/m2 or LA diameter ≥55 mm], AF, systolic pulmonary 
artery pressure (SPAP) at rest of >50 mmHg, and concomitant moderate or severe secondary TR are associated with worse long-term 
prognosis irrespective of LV function after corrective surgery, and 
should therefore prompt referral in low-risk patients, particularly if 
a high probability of MV repair is expected.517,518,547 A recent study 
showed that women have a higher risk of long-term mortality after 
MV repair than men, even at lower degrees of ventricular dilatation 
and dysfunction, suggesting the potential usefulness of sex-specific indexed thresholds.548 Ventricular arrhythmias in patients with MV prolapse have been linked to impaired prognosis and possibly sudden 
cardiac death, especially in the presence of mitral annular disjunction.549–551 Ring annuloplasty stabilizes the posterior annulus, reduces 
traction on the subvalvular apparatus,552 and may lower the risk of arrhythmias.553 Minimally invasive surgery via right mini-thoracotomy is 
used with increasing frequency in experienced centres.554–556 A recent RCT demonstrated similar safety and efficacy compared with 
conventional sternotomy. Mini-thoracotomy was associated with 
shorter hospital stay and improved physical activity within the first 
6 weeks after surgery, a difference that disappeared at 12 weeks.557 
The use of minimally invasive MV surgery may therefore be considered to reduce hospital stay and accelerate recovery in experienced 
centres. However, in a national registry, these benefits were less 
clear.558

9.1.5. Follow-up 
Asymptomatic patients with severe MR not fulfilling the criteria for an 
intervention, and with documented preserved exercise capacity, should 
undergo clinical and echocardiographic follow-up twice per year (watchful waiting strategy), ideally in the setting of a Heart Valve Clinic.568 
Follow-up may also include serial measurements of BNP levels, electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or Holter monitoring, and (in selected cases) exercise echocardiography and CMR to confirm MR severity, and cardiac 
chamber function and dimensions.46 Asymptomatic patients with moderate MR and preserved LV function can be followed on a yearly basis 
with echocardiographic assessment every 1 or 2 years. 
The frequency of follow-up after an intervention depends on the type 
of procedure performed. Very good long-term durability of MV repair in 
PMR due to valve prolapse with a low recurrence rate has been reported 
at experienced centres with freedom from moderate or severe MR of 
87.5% at 20 years.533,559 Serial clinical and echocardiographic follow-up 
in patients without pre-operative LV dysfunction or rhythm abnormalities every 2–3 years thereafter is sufficient. Patients with atrial or ventricular arrhythmias possibly related to MV disease should be further 
evaluated using continuous ECG monitoring. Patients with recurrent 
MR after surgical ring annuloplasty frequently undergo repeat surgery 
(usually MV replacement), while transcatheter alternatives are reserved 
for selected high-risk patients because of the risk of increased gradients 
(M-TEER), PVL, and LVOT obstruction (mitral valve-in-ring procedures).569,570 In patients undergoing MV replacement, closer follow-up 
on a yearly basis is required due to the risk of prosthetic valve dysfunction 
or SVD (see Section 14.4). Following TEER, reported rates of residual MR 
and increased transmitral gradients are higher than after surgical repair, 
suggesting that yearly follow-up is appropriate.571 Although rare, the 
need for surgical treatment after failed TEER is associated with increased 
peri-operative mortality and low valve repair rates,541,572 while transcatheter solutions to detach TEER implants and replace the valve have 
been described in few cases.573,574 
9.2. Secondary mitral regurgitation 
9.2.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Secondary mitral regurgitation is present when the MV structure appears 
grossly normal but the MV is nonetheless incompetent, due to alterations 
in LV and LA geometry, dyssynchrony, and imbalances between MV closing and tethering forces.575 The prevalence of severe SMR in patients with 
chronic HF is ∼10% and higher in patients with reduced vs preserved LVEF 
(25% vs 4%).576 Secondary mitral regurgitation can be classified as atrial or 
ventricular with different pathophysiological and morphological characteristics, as well as contrasting prognostic and therapeutic implications.577 
Ventricular SMR is more common and associated with worse long-term 
prognosis.513,578–580 Dilated or ischaemic cardiomyopathy are the most 
frequent causes of severe ventricular SMR. Acute HF exacerbation may 
occur in patients with chronic HF due to a renewed ischaemic event, arrhythmia, infection, or volume overload. Atrial SMR is due to pure mitral 
annular dilation and is observed in patients with long-standing AF and/or 
HFpEF.581 Factors predisposing to atrial SMR include age ≥65 years, female sex, LA dilatation, and diastolic dysfunction.582 From a morphological 
point of view, ventricular SMR is characterized by leaflet tethering and restricted motion combined with annular dilation, while annulus enlargement and flattening leading to planar coaptation are predominantly 
observed in atrial SMR. The prevalence of atrial SMR has been underestimated in the past and was occasionally misclassified as PMR due to 
pseudo-prolapse with leaflet tethering in advanced stages. 
9.2.2. Evaluation 
Echocardiographic criteria to define significant SMR according to aetiology are reported in Figure 10. Importantly, SMR assessment should 
be performed after optimization of medical therapy and in a euvolaemic 
and normotensive state. When quantifying EROA and RVol in SMR, 
lower thresholds may apply to define severe regurgitation because of 
the potential elliptical regurgitant orifice and/or the low-flow state. 
An EROA of ≥30 mm2 and/or an RVol of ≥45 mL has been identified 
as having a significant impact on outcomes,45 with prognosis improved 
after treatment.583,584 Cardiac magnetic resonance is used to confirm 
SMR severity and assess cardiac chamber function and dimensions. 
The extent of myocardial fibrosis, as assessed with CMR, has been associated with poor prognosis.585 Owing to the dynamic nature of SMR, 
exercise echocardiography may help to identify patients with severe 
SMR when values at rest are inconclusive.45 
9.2.3. Definition of atrial secondary mitral 
regurgitation 
Characteristics distinguishing between atrial and ventricular SMR are 
displayed in Figure 12. 
Surgical MV repair is recommended in low-risk 
asymptomatic patients with severe PMR without LV 
dysfunction (LVESD <40 mm, LVESDi <20 mm/m2, 
and LVEF >60%) when a durable result is likely, if at 
least three of the following criteria are 
fulfilled:517,547,562–564

Atrial SMR is most frequently defined by the presence of the following key criteria:513,578–580,586–590 
• preserved LVEF (≥50%) without regional wall motion abnormalities 
or leaflet tethering; AND 
• no or mildly dilated LV cavity [LV end-diastolic dimension of <56 mm 
in women and <63 mm in men; indexed LV end-diastolic volume of 
<71 mL/m2 (in women) or <79 mL/m2 (in men)]; AND 
• mitral annulus (MA) dilatation [anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 
>35 mm]; AND 
• enlarged LA (LAVI >34 mL/m2).  
Echocardiography frequently reveals normal leaflet motion with planar coaptation, and normal leaflet morphology with a central MR jet in 
atrial SMR. However, at advanced stages, an overlap between atrial and 
ventricular SMR criteria can be observed in the case of late LV damage 
due to continuous volume overload.591,592 Clinical criteria (i.e. history 
of AF and/or diagnosis of HFpEF) are also useful and should be taken 
into consideration. 
9.2.4. Management of ventricular secondary mitral  
regurgitation 
9.2.4.1. Medical and device therapy 
In patients with ventricular SMR, GDMT for the treatment of HF is recommended prior to any MV intervention.339,340 The combination of 
ACE-Is/ARBs or angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors, beta- 
blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium–glucose 
co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) at the maximum tolerated doses 
is recommended according to the HF Guidelines.340 Initiation and up- 
titration of neurohormonal drugs need to be tailored according to 
the patient profile, mainly based on BP, heart rate, potassium levels, 
and renal function.593 Notably, GDMT up-titration must be rapid (within 6 weeks) and take place in the context of close follow-up visits, especially in the case of a recent hospitalization for acute HF.594 About 
40% of patients with ventricular SMR experience improvement of 
SMR severity after 1–3 months of optimized GDMT.595,596 Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) should also be considered as part of HF 
management before an MV intervention according to HF guideline criteria (LVEF ≤35% and wide QRS).597,598 Although no dedicated RCTs

exist, SMR reduction by at least one grade has been described in 40%– 
60% of patients and is associated with reverse LV remodelling and improved clinical outcomes.597,599,600 
9.2.4.2. Indications for intervention 
The management of patients with ventricular SMR should be discussed 
by a multidisciplinary Heart Team including HF specialists. The indication for intervention is based on the persistence of symptoms (i.e. 
NYHA class II–V) despite adequate GDMT and CRT, if indicated 
(Figure 13). GDMT is the only option for very frail patients or those 
with limited life expectancy. 
In the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip 
Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional 
Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT) trial, M-TEER was shown to be safe 
and reduced recurrent HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality 
at 2 and 5 years of follow-up, compared with optimized GDMT 
in patients with ventricular SMR without relevant CAD.583,584

Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation, MITRA-FR), no differences were demonstrated for the combined primary endpoint of all- 
cause mortality or HF hospitalization at 1 and 2 years.601,602 These diverging results might be explained by effect sizes of the trials, differences 
in trial design, patient selection and follow-up, echocardiographic assessment of SMR severity, use of GDMT, and technical factors.603–605 A 
third RCT, the Randomized Investigation of the MitraClip Device in 
Heart Failure: 2nd Trial in Patients with Clinically Significant 
Functional Mitral Regurgitation (RESHAPE-HF-2) trial showed a 36% 
reduction in the rates of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death 
at 2 years in the intervention arm driven by reduction of first or recurrent HF hospitalization. When considered in isolation, cardiovascular 
mortality was not significantly reduced during the observation period. 
In addition, there was a significant improvement in quality of life as 
measured by the KCCQ overall score (mean difference between study 
groups, 10.9 points; 95% CI, 6.8–15.0; P <0.001).606 A recent study-level 
meta-analysis of these three trials showed a significant reduction of HF 
rehospitalization at 24 months (HR, 0.63, 95% CI, 0.50–0.80) and the 
composite of death and all-cause hospitalizations (HR, 0.72, 95% CI, 
0.51–0.999).607 However, there was no statistically significant difference 
in death from any cause or cardiovascular death at 24 months. 
Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is therefore recommended to reduce HF hospitalizations, and improve quality of life, in symptomatic patients with persisting severe SMR despite optimized GDMT fulfilling 
specific clinical and echocardiographic criteria (Table 7). Although less 
challenging than in PMR, anatomical suitability for TEER needs to be assessed upfront (Supplementary data online, Table S2). There is also increasing observational evidence supporting the use of TEER for the 
improvement of symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with ventricular SMR not fulfilling the clinical and echocardiographic criteria for outcome improvement.608–612 This particularly 
applies to patients not tolerating GDMT in whom TEER may help up- 
titration, as well as those with recent myocardial infarction and persistent severe ventricular SMR.203,613 
Transcatheter implantation of an indirect annuloplasty device into 
the coronary sinus has been proposed as an alternative that preserves 
valve integrity. Despite rather modest SMR reduction (22.4% decrease 
in mitral RVol) and no significant effect on quality of life in a small sham- 
controlled RCT, symptomatic improvement and reverse remodelling 
were observed in registries at 1 year.614,615 Heart transplantation or 
left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation should be considered 
in selected patients with severe ventricular SMR and advanced HF. 
In patients with ventricular SMR without relevant CAD, indications 
for isolated MV surgery are restrictive owing to procedural risks and 
the absence of proven mortality benefit.616 The Multicenter, 
Randomized, Controlled Study to Assess Mitral Valve Reconstruction 
for Advanced Insufficiency of Functional or Ischemic Origin 
(MATTERHORN) trial, which included a mixed population mainly composed of patients with ventricular SMR (84%), demonstrated that TEER 
is non-inferior to surgical repair or replacement with regard to a composite endpoint of death, HF hospitalization, MV reintervention, implantation of an assist device, or stroke within 1 year after the 
procedure, and showed a better safety profile.617 In patients with severe ischaemic ventricular SMR and concomitant CAD requiring coronary revascularization, MV surgery at the time of CABG is 
recommended, unless the patient is at high surgical risk and/or the coronary anatomy is suitable for PCI. Although isolated undersized mitral 
annuloplasty is the most commonly performed MV repair procedure, 
recurrent MR rates were high with this technique in an RCT618 and reverse LV remodelling is limited, especially in patients with an increased 
tenting area (>1.35 cm2/m2 BSA),619 in whom MV replacement is usually required.620 The addition of subvalvular modification in patients 
with LV dilatation and pronounced MV leaflet tenting may improve results for MV repair,621 but durability and impact on HF symptoms with 
this technique require further investigation. 
The treatment of moderate ischaemic SMR in patients undergoing 
CABG remains controversial. Meta-analyses, including four RCTs comparing CABG with concomitant MV surgery vs CABG alone, have 
shown lower rates of recurrent MR but no benefit in terms of mortality 
and clinical outcomes.622–624 Therefore, clinical decision-making should 
weigh peri-operative risks of more complex surgery against the long- 
term risk of MR progression. 
9.2.4.3. Follow-up 
Patients with ventricular SMR need to be followed up carefully after 
intervention by an HF specialist, because they remain at increased 
risk of events despite intervention. The 5-year cumulative incidence 
of all-cause death or HF hospitalization was 73.6% in the device arm 
of the COAPT study.584 Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic 
evaluation every 3 or 6 months, according to the HF stage, is recommended. Durability of the procedural result, as well as congestion status 
and the need for further GDMT optimization facilitated by SMR reduction,613 need to be assessed. Patients and families should be trained in 
monitoring vital signs, body weight, and HF symptoms to avoid late hospital admissions and facilitate management of possible decompensation. 
Also, patients must be educated on the importance of not discontinuing 
medical therapies after intervention since the two treatments (devices 
and drugs) are complementary. 
Patients with ventricular SMR, who are asymptomatic and/or have 
moderate or dynamic MR, should undergo clinical and echocardiographic follow-up at least twice per year.

9.2.5. Management of atrial secondary mitral 
regurgitation 
9.2.5.1. Medical therapy and rhythm management 
In patients with atrial SMR, underlying causes need to be recognized and 
treated. Associated HFpEF and AF should be managed according to the 
relevant Guidelines.7,340 The use of SGLT2is should be encouraged in 
patients with HFpEF due to their proven efficacy in reducing cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization.625 Limited data show that rhythm 
control may contribute to reduce atrial SMR severity and reverse LA 
dilatation.626 
9.2.5.2. Indications for intervention 
Registry data demonstrate that patients with atrial SMR are typically 
elderly with associated AF. Mitral valve surgery has been recently associated with lower rates of HF hospitalizations and mortality compared 
with GDMT in a matched population, despite a higher risk profile in the 
surgical arm at baseline.627 Data from several observational studies also 
suggest that surgical annuloplasty is effective and durable in patients with 
atrial SMR, because it counteracts the main mechanism of MR progression.628–630 Its combination with surgical AF ablation (Maze procedure) 
and concomitant LAAO may have further advantages,630,631 while the frequently associated relevant TR can also be addressed during the same procedure.627 Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair may also be considered 
because observational studies have demonstrated high safety and procedural success,588–590,632,633 as well as compared with surgery in a small subgroup (n = 34) of the MATTERHORN RCT.634 However, the risk of 
increased gradient due to planar leaflet coaptation, large regurgitant jet, 
and limited MV area (MVA) needs to be taken into consideration.592,635 
Further studies are warranted to investigate the treatment modalities of 
patients with atrial SMR. 
9.2.5.3. Follow-up 
Patients with atrial SMR undergoing surgical or transcatheter intervention should be followed up on a yearly basis, including clinical and echocardiographic evaluation. In cases of HFpEF, as an underlying cause of 
atrial SMR, consultation with an HF specialist is necessary. 
Asymptomatic patients with severe atrial SMR not fulfilling the criteria for an intervention should undergo clinical and echocardiographic 
follow-up at least once per year. 
10. Mitral stenosis 
10.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
The aetiology of MS is most frequently rheumatic or degenerative, 
while rare forms can be drug-induced, inflammatory, or 
carcinoid-related. Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of 
MS and death due to VHD worldwide. Its prevalence has decreased 
in high- and middle-income countries, but remains a major healthcare problem in low-income countries, where it predominantly 
affects young patients.12,187,644 Degenerative MS related to MAC 
is 
a 
distinct 
age-dependent 
pathology 
requiring 
different 
treatment strategies.645–647 Both aetiologies are more frequent in 
females.648 
10.2. Rheumatic mitral stenosis 
10.2.1. Evaluation 
Echocardiography is the preferred method for screening in endemic regions and the assessment of the severity, extent of anatomical lesions, 
and haemodynamic consequences of MS. Involvement of other valves,

2D planimetry is the most commonly used measurement to assess 
stenosis severity, but 3D TTE and TOE have additional diagnostic 
value.649 An MVA of ≤1.5 cm2 in conjunction with clinical factors 
(symptoms, high risk of thromboembolism, or haemodynamic decompensation) is indicative of clinically severe MS. Mean transvalvular gradient and pulmonary pressures reflect its consequences and have 
prognostic value.649,650 Leaflet thickening and fibrosis, along with commissural fusion and shortening of the subvalvular apparatus, are the 
most important pathomechanisms of stenosis associated with RHD. 
The presence and extent of leaflet and subvalvular calcifications influence treatment decisions. Scoring systems have been developed to assess the suitability of patients for percutaneous mitral commissurotomy 
(PMC) (see Supplementary data online, Table S3).651–653 
Exercise testing is indicated in asymptomatic patients or patients 
with symptoms that are equivocal or discordant with the severity of 
stenosis. Exercise echocardiography provides additional information 
on exercise capacity and related changes in mitral gradient and pulmonary artery pressure, and is preferred over DSE, especially when there 
are contraindications to dobutamine.654 Transoesophageal echocardiography should be systematically performed in PMC candidates to exclude LA thrombus or after an embolic episode, and may play an 
essential role for procedural guidance.52,655 
10.2.2. Medical therapy 
Diuretics, beta-blockers, digoxin, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers, and ivabradine can improve symptoms by controlling volume 
overload and heart rate. Anticoagulation with a VKA with a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is indicated in patients 
with AF, and DOACs should be avoided in patients with an MVA of 
≤2.0 cm2 according to current evidence.165,656,657 Interventions to restore sinus rhythm (cardioversion or catheter pulmonary vein isolation) 
are unlikely to be successful in patients with untreated severe MS. If AF 
is of recent onset and the LA moderately enlarged, cardioversion can be 
attempted soon after successful intervention or in patients with moderate MS combined with amiodarone treatment.658,659 In patients in 
sinus rhythm, OAC is indicated after systemic embolism or if a thrombus is present in the LA, and should also be considered when TOE 
shows dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast or an enlarged 
LA (M-mode diameter >50 mm or LA volume >60 mL/m2).660 
Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis is indicated as appropriate.5 
10.2.3. Indications for intervention 
The type (PMC or surgery) and timing of treatment should be decided 
based on clinical characteristics, the anatomy of the valve and subvalvular apparatus, and local expertise.661–663 The management of clinically 
severe rheumatic MS is summarized in Figure 14 and Recommendation 
Table 8. 
In general, indication for intervention should be limited to patients 
with clinically severe rheumatic MS (MVA <1.5 cm2) in whom PMC is 
expected to have a significant impact on clinical outcome. In higher- 
income countries, where the incidence of rheumatic fever and the number of PMCs performed is low, this treatment should be restricted to 
expert operators in specialized centres to improve safety and procedural success rate.661,664 Efforts should be made to increase the availability of PMC in lower-income countries, where access to treatment is 
limited for economic reasons.665,666 Percutaneous mitral commissurotomy 
may be also considered in symptomatic patients with an MVA of 
>1.5 cm2, if symptoms cannot be explained by another cause and 
if the anatomy is favourable (see Table 8). Percutaneous mitral 
commissurotomy should be considered as a first-line treatment for patients with anatomically suitable rheumatic MS and mild-to-moderate 
calcification without severe subvalvular impairment. Selected patients 
with unfavourable anatomical and clinical characteristics can still benefit 
from PMC, particularly if they are at increased surgical risk. When 
symptomatic restenosis occurs after surgical commissurotomy or 
PMC, reintervention in most cases requires surgical valve replacement, 
but redo PMC can be proposed in selected candidates with favourable 
characteristics, if the predominant mechanism is commissural refusion. 
Long-term follow-up has shown favourable results following PMC despite a growing number of elderly patients with suboptimal clinical and 
anatomical characteristics.663–665 
For patients in whom PMC is contraindicated (Table 8), surgical MV 
repair or, more frequently, replacement are good alternatives. 
Although repair is much more challenging than for PMR, it can be attempted at experienced centres.663 
For patients with multiple VHD including MS, a comprehensive 
evaluation by the Heart Team and an individualized approach is necessary. Surgery is preferable to PMC in patients with severe MS and severe AV disease, unless the surgical risk is high. In selected cases with 
severe MS and moderate AV disease, PMC can be performed to postpone surgical treatment of both valves. 
In high-risk cases with concomitant severe TR, PMC may be considered in selected patients with sinus rhythm, moderate atrial enlargement, and secondary TR due to post-capillary PH. In non-high-risk 
cases, surgery on both valves is preferred.651,652,662,667 Treatment of 
patients with low-gradient severe MS (MVA <1.5 cm2, mean gradient  
<10 mmHg) is challenging, because these patients are often older 
and have unfavourable anatomy.668,669 
10.2.4. Follow-up 
Asymptomatic patients with clinically severe MS who have not undergone intervention should be followed up yearly by TTE, and at longer intervals (2–3 years) in cases of moderate stenosis. After PMC, the 
post-procedural MVA and mean mitral gradient are important parameters that influence long-term clinical outcomes. Follow-up of patients 
after successful PMC is necessary because asymptomatic restenosis may 
occur. Progressive rheumatic involvement of other valves should be periodically assessed, irrespective of the therapy modality. Finally, education 
and the engagement of the family is key in patients with rheumatic MS, 
since it usually affects young individuals and women of childbearing age. 
10.3. Degenerative mitral stenosis with 
mitral annular calcification 
Patients presenting with MAC are elderly and have significant comorbidities, including disease of other valves. Mitral annular calcification is also an 
indicator of cardiovascular disease severity and is associated with an increased risk of AF, stroke, and death.670,671 The incidence of MAC varies 
substantially, depending on the age of the studied population and the imaging modality used. It can be a consequence of many different pathological processes and, depending on the underlying disease, can be 
accompanied by stenosis, regurgitation, or both. However, most patients 
with MAC do not have significant valvular dysfunction.647,672 
Generally, MS occurs due to calcific extension into the MV leaflets or 
subvalvular apparatus, and in some patients it is associated with combined MR.673 Treatment options (including transcatheter and surgical 
approaches) are high-risk procedures and evidence from RCTs is 
lacking.

10.3.1. Evaluation 
Echocardiography is used for initial evaluation, but is frequently limited 
by acoustic shadowing due to severe calcification. Evaluation of MVA by 
planimetry is less reliable than in rheumatic MS, and TOE should 
therefore be used liberally. Degenerative MS can coexist with varying 
degrees of MR. Mean transmitral gradient has been shown to be associated with increased mortality irrespective of MR severity.674 
Electrocardiogram-gated CCT is necessary to assess the degree and locations of calcifications, especially if an intervention is planned.647,674–676 
Calcifications are usually more prominent at the posterior aspect of the 
annulus. 
10.3.2. Indications for intervention 
Intervention is recommended in symptomatic patients who are not responsive to medical therapy, weighing the potential benefits of the procedure against its associated risks. In elderly patients with degenerative MS 
and MAC, surgery is technically challenging and high risk. However,

surgical MV repair or replacement with extensive decalcification and 
patch reconstruction of the annulus can be performed in selected patients 
at experienced centres (e.g. young patients post-chest radiation), where 
mortality rates of <5% have been reported.677–679 
Degenerative MS is not amenable to PMC because commissural fusion is absent. In symptomatic high-risk patients with suitable anatomy, transcatheter implantation of a TAVI prosthesis in the mitral 
position is feasible but associated with frequent complications, including LVOT obstruction, valve embolization, stroke, and haemolysis due 
to PVL. Open surgical valve replacement via the LA with a TAVI device 
is an alternative that allows complete anterior leaflet removal;680 
however, mortality remains high. The use of dedicated TMVI devices 
is therefore encouraged because it appears to be safer.542,681 Heart 
Team evaluation should guide the choice of treatment avoiding futility, 
because mortality remains high, even after successful treatment 
(10%–30% within 1 year). 
11. Tricuspid regurgitation 
11.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
TR is a common echocardiographic finding in the general population, 
with higher prevalence in women and older patients. Trivial or mild 
TR is mostly a benign condition. Significant TR (≥ moderate) has a reported age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of 0.55% (4% in people aged 
≥75 years).682 Severe TR is associated with increased risk of death 
and HF, independent of comorbidities, ventricular function, and pulmonary pressures.683–686 
Only 8%–10% of patients with TR present with clear anatomical abnormalities of the TV apparatus (primary TR), which can be due to infective endocarditis, RHD, carcinoid syndrome, congenital abnormalities (e.g. 
Ebstein’s anomaly), chest radiation, or myxomatous disease, as well as 
trauma or iatrogenic valve damage (e.g. after endomyocardial biopsy).682 
Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)-related TR represents a 
separate entity requiring a specific diagnostic approach and management.687 In patients with a CIED, diagnostic efforts should be made to 
clarify if the lead is the cause of TR (CIED-related TR) or incidental 
(CIED-associated TR).688 
In patients with secondary TR, TV leaflets are structurally normal and 
regurgitation is caused by annular dilatation and/or leaflet tethering due 
to RA dilatation, and/or RV dilation and dysfunction. Based on the main 
morphological and haemodynamic characteristics, two phenotypes of 
secondary TR have been proposed:689 (i) atrial secondary TR, mainly 
due to AF and characterized by the absence of significant leaflet tethering, but with marked RA and annular dilatation along with preserved RV 
size/function, pulmonary pressure, and LV function; and (ii) ventricular 
secondary TR, due to annular dilatation and leaflet tethering as a consequence of left-sided ventricular or valvular disease (post-capillary 
PH), pre-capillary PH, or primary RV cardiomyopathy/ischaemia (also 
after left-sided valve surgery).690 At an advanced disease stage, these 
two phenotypes may no longer be distinguishable, and therefore early 
characterization is key to determine outcome.691,692 Evidence of an impact on patient management is currently lacking; therefore, current 
recommendations for intervention consider mainly primary vs secondary TR.

11.2. Evaluation 
Echocardiography is recommended to assess patients with TR45 and 
should include evaluation of severity and aetiology (including characterization of left-sided heart disease and, if applicable, CIED lead location 
and interaction with the valve apparatus), the impact of TR on the right- 
sided chambers (RV and RA size and function), and assessment of central venous (inferior vena cava) and pulmonary pressures. Transthoracic 
echocardiography provides sufficient diagnostic information in most 
patients. Transoesophageal echocardiography is necessary for when 
visualization of the TV apparatus. In candidates for an intervention, advanced techniques, such as strain analysis and 3D echocardiography, 
should also be applied when available. 
Assessment of TR severity should be ideally performed in euvolaemic status, with optimized pulmonary and systemic pressures, and 
based on an integrative approach considering multiple qualitative and 
quantitative parameters (Figure 15).45,693 A grading scheme extending 
beyond severe, including ‘massive’ and ‘torrential’ grades, has been proposed to refine TR reduction assessment after transcatheter interventions and has been used in several studies.694,695 Although this 
five-grade scale may be associated with a proportional increase in 
symptoms and event risk,694,695 an intervention should be considered 
without delay, as soon as TR is severe, with the aim of reducing TR 
to moderate or less.696,697 
Echocardiographic assessment of the RV is challenging due to its 
complex geometry, imaging constraints, and the high dependency on 
loading conditions. When accurate measurements of RV size and function, as well as RV volume, are necessary for decision-making, CMR 
should be used because of its high accuracy and reproducibility.698,699 
In Figure 15, upper limits of normal for different RV size parameters 
are provided to guide definition of RV dilatation and remodelling. In 
the setting of severe TR, RV function is often overestimated and therefore the most conservative/cautious thresholds are suggested for the 
currently used echocardiographic parameters to identify RV dysfunction at the earliest stage possible. Cut-off values for severe RV dysfunction are also provided to indicate high-risk or possibly futile 
interventions. Although robust validation is lacking, all these reference 
values are chosen based on large multicentre reports of normative data 
and outcomes.60,697,700–704 
Echocardiography often underestimates pulmonary pressures in 
cases of severe TR.705 Right heart catheterization is therefore recommended in all candidates for an intervention to assess the haemodynamic consequences of TR on the RA and venous circulation (e.g. 
ventricularization of the RA pressure curves), measure end-diastolic 
RV pressure, and document volume overload. The assessment of pulmonary pressures and vascular resistance are key to exclude masked 
severe pre-capillary PH.706 
RV–pulmonary artery coupling refers to the ability of the RV systolic 
performance to match a given pulmonary afterload maintaining adequate cardiac output, and can be measured invasively or approximated using echocardiography [i.e. tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE)/SPAP].707,708 RV–pulmonary artery uncoupling 
(low TAPSE/SPAP) occurs when sustained increases in afterload cannot be matched by RV contractile reserve and has been associated 
with poor prognosis in different HF conditions, including severe TR. 
Although not yet prospectively validated, this index may improve 
risk stratification. 
Electrocardiogram-gated CCT with dedicated protocols ensuring 
sufficient contrast enhancement of the right heart cavities provides detailed characterization of the RA, RV, and vena cava anatomy, the location of the right coronary artery, and is crucial to assess suitability and 
device sizing for several transcatheter interventions.689,697 
Before any intervention is considered, careful evaluation of TR aetiology, disease stage (TR severity, RV and LV dysfunction, and PH), patient operative risk, and likelihood of recovery by a dedicated 
collaborative Heart Team is recommended (Figure 16). Dedicated clinical risk scores for TR patients have been described recently. The 
TRI-SCORE709 and the STS isolated TV risk calculator710 take into consideration clinical and echocardiographic signs of RV dysfunction, and 
secondary organ (particularly hepatic and renal) impairment. They 
both allow improved estimates of peri-procedural risk in patients 
with severe TR undergoing surgery and possibly help to avoid futile interventions.84,711 The importance of risk stratification was demonstrated in a recent registry analysis (n = 2413) comparing any 
interventions with conservative management. Early TV intervention 
(transcatheter valve repair or surgery) was associated with improved 
mid-term survival in patients with a low or intermediate TRI-SCORE 
(up to 5 points), while patients with a high TRI-SCORE (≥6) did not derive any benefit compared with conservative management.696 
Moreover, isolated TV surgery (repair or replacement) improved survival at 10 years in patients with a low TRI-SCORE (≤3). The same 
benefit was observed in patients with an intermediate TRI-SCORE 
(4–5) after successful TV repair only.689,697,709 Patients with moderate 
or severe TR should be regularly followed up clinically and by echocardiography at least every 6 months. 
11.3. Medical therapy 
Patients with relevant TR should be first treated according to the assumed aetiology, including optimal HF treatment, pulmonary vasodilators for PH, and rhythm control for AF.339,693 
In the case of HF symptoms, diuretics should be initiated in a stepwise approach,339 beginning with loop diuretics eventually combined 
with aldosterone antagonists, thiazide diuretics, and/or SGLT2is.712 
However, according to current knowledge, medical therapy has very 
limited effect on the evolution of TR severity and none of these measures should delay evaluation of an intervention at an expert centre.713 
11.4. Indications for intervention 
11.4.1. Surgery 
Patients are often referred too late for surgery when significant RV and 
other organ failure have occurred. Isolated TV surgery has therefore 
been considered to be generally high risk, with in-hospital mortality 
rates of 8%–10% in several reports,714,715 but contemporary cohorts 
have demonstrated improved outcomes when patients are referred 
earlier and more effective techniques are used.716 Valve repair using 
an annuloplasty ring is preferred over replacement, whenever technically feasible, especially in low-risk patients with suitable anatomy.709 
However, TV replacement may be necessary in cases of advanced disease with marked annular dilatation and leaflet tethering.688,717 For 
CIED-related TR, preparation of any entrapped tricuspid leaflet and 
possibly lead extraction with implantation of an epicardial system has 
been associated with improved TV function.688,717

11.4.1.1. Patients without indication for left-sided valve  
surgery 
In patients with severe TR but without the need for left-sided valve surgery, surgical intervention is recommended in operable symptomatic 
patients with primary TR (Figure 17; Recommendation Table 9).718 
Furthermore, it should be considered in symptomatic patients with secondary TR, or in asymptomatic patients with primary or secondary TR 
and signs of RV dilatation or RV function deterioration.719 However, 
patients with severe LV/RV dysfunction or PH do not qualify due to 
high operative risk.84,686,720 
11.4.1.2. Patients with indication for left-sided valve surgery 
Severe primary or secondary TR is unlikely to improve after isolated 
surgical treatment of left-sided valve disease, and reoperation for 
TR treatment is associated with high peri-operative mortality.721 
Therefore, TV surgery is recommended at the time of the index 
procedure. 
Mild TR with associated significant annular dilatation or moderate 
TR, if left uncorrected at the time of left-sided valve surgery, will progress in approximately one-quarter of patients and is associated with 
worse outcome.690,722 In patients with moderate TR, TV repair annuloplasty during MV surgery should be considered, because large retrospective studies723,724 and two recent RCTs have shown beneficial 
effects on TR progression and RV remodelling over time.725,726 
However, no effects on mortality, HF events, or reoperation were observed in the repair group.725,727 Concomitant TV repair has also 
been associated with a higher risk of conduction disturbances requiring pacemaker implantation (up to 14%),725,728 with potential negative 
impacts on longer-term outcomes.729,730 In patients with mild TR and 
annular dilatation (≥40 mm or >21 mm/m2) undergoing left-sided 
valve surgery, previous observational studies have demonstrated a 
benefit of concomitant TV repair in terms of TR progression723,724 
and RV function,731 and a trend towards improved long-term survival.724 
However, a subanalysis of a recent RCT did not identify any difference in 
the progression of TR or other outcomes in this category of patients

during a 2-year follow-up period.725 In turn, the need of pacemaker implantation after surgery led to a subsequent increase in HF hospitalizations, endocarditis, and mortality.729 Annuloplasty may therefore 
be considered after careful evaluation of the risk factors for progressive annular dilatation and TR (AF, RA size, pulmonary pressures, 
etc.), balancing against the risk of possible pacemaker implantation 
(Supplementary data online, Table S5).732 
11.4.2. Transcatheter techniques 
Several transcatheter approaches for the treatment of TR have been 
developed, including TEER, direct annuloplasty, and orthotopic and heterotopic TV replacement. Data from large multicentre registries, single- 
arm clinical trials, and two recent RCTs in patients with severe TR at 
intermediate and high risk for surgery have shown the safety of transcatheter repair, as well as the ability to reduce TR to moderate or less in

more than 80% of cases when anatomical suitability was confirmed.713,733–735 The Clinical Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular 
Outcomes in Patients Treated With the Tricuspid Valve Repair 
System (TRILUMINATE) Pivotal Trial showed also a lower incidence 
of the composite endpoint of death from any cause or TV surgery, 
HF hospitalization, and improvement in quality of life as measured 
with the KCCQ score after tricuspid TEER compared with medical 
treatment that was exclusively driven by improved quality of life 
[11.7 points (95% CI, 6.8–16.6); P <0.001].713 At 2 years, a lower incidence of HF hospitalizations has been observed in the intervention 
group, despite a high rate of crossovers (59%).736 
Another investigator-initiated RCT (the Tri.Fr trial) demonstrated 
the benefit of tricuspid TEER in combination with GDMT over medical 
therapy alone, for a composite score driven by improved PROMs.737 
Another recent RCT (the Edwards EVOQUE Transcatheter 
Tricuspid Valve Replacement: Pivotal Clinical Investigation of Safety 
and Clinical Efficacy using a Novel Device (TRISCEND) II trial), comparing transcatheter TV replacement with optimized medical therapy in 
patients with symptomatic severe TR, showed similar results with a 
win ratio favouring TV replacement mainly explained by symptom 
and quality-of-life improvement. In these studies, reverse RV remodelling was also observed. However, the safety profile of transcatheter TV 
replacement was less favourable, including higher risk for major bleeding (15%) and post-procedural pacemaker implantation in about one- 
quarter of the pacemaker-naïve patients after 12 months of follow- 
up.738 Based on these data, transcatheter treatment should be considered to improve quality of life and RV remodelling in high-risk patients 
with symptomatic severe TR, despite optimal medical therapy, but 
without severe RV dysfunction or pre-capillary PH. 
Transvenous CIED lead repositioning or extraction can be considered in selected patients to improve TR or avoid lead jailing before 
any tricuspid interventions, although the efficacy of this procedure is 
uncertain and the risk of damaging the TV not negligible.688,717,739 
Recurrent TR after previous tricuspid annuloplasty usually requires cardiac reoperation for surgical TV replacement. Transcatheter valve-in-ring 
implantation is an off-label procedure to treat residual TR in high-risk patients. Challenges are the non-circular shape and the open form of the surgical annuloplasty ring.740 However, transcatheter tricuspid valve-in-valve 
procedures have been performed with satisfactory results.741 
Transcatheter TV procedures should be performed at an experienced Heart Valve Centre with expertise in the treatment of 
TV disease (Table 6). Careful evaluation of clinical and anatomical 
suitability is key for appropriate patient and device selection to 
achieve optimal TR reduction and symptomatic response to the 
therapy. 
12. Tricuspid stenosis 
12.1. Prevalence and aetiology 
Tricuspid stenosis (TS) is a relatively rare disease that is most commonly 
associated with congenital conditions or enzymatic disorders, such as 
Whipple’s or Fabry’s disease. It can also be acquired as an isolated manifestation of RHD or occur in combination with aortic and/or MV involvement. Moreover, TS can be the consequence of carcinoid disease due to 
serotonin-mediated proliferation, causing apposition of fibroblasts and 
extracellular matrix on the valve leaflets and the subvalvular apparatus. 
Rare causes include medications (e.g. fenfluramine or methysergide) or inflow obstruction due to CIED-associated thrombus formation or endocarditis with large vegetations. 
12.2. Evaluation 
Valve evaluation and diagnosis of TS is based on echocardiography, and 
consists of the anatomical assessment of the leaflet tissue and the subvalvular apparatus. Leaflet thickening with or without calcifications and

commissural fusions are pathognomonic findings of rheumatic involvement. A mean diastolic transvalvular gradient of >5 mmHg at a normal 
heart rate indicates severe TS.649 
12.3. Medical therapy 
Medical therapy is a bridge to surgical or transcatheter intervention. 
Intensive sodium restriction and concomitant diuretic therapy can 
lead to symptom improvement and diminish hepatic congestion. 
12.4. Indications for intervention 
Although valve repair is preferred in younger patients,752 valve replacement is frequently required (see Recommendation Table 10). Biological 
heart valves have demonstrated adequate mid- and long-term results, 
and are preferred over MHVs because of high thrombogenicity in the 
low-pressure system.753 In the case of BHV degeneration, transcatheter 
valve-in-valve procedures are good alternatives to re-replacement.754 
Transcatheter TV implantation is an emerging field, although limited experience is available for the treatment of TS.749,755 In patients with carcinoid disease, a stable oncological situation is a prerequisite for any 
valve intervention to maximize survival and valve durability.756 
Although data are very limited, TV balloon valvuloplasty can be an 
option in selected patients with TS (and no relevant TR), as well as in 
those with concomitant mitral and tricuspid rheumatic pathology.757 
However, in contrast to rheumatic MS, tricuspid rheumatic disease 
more frequently presents as combined stenosis and regurgitation, 
which limits the applicability of balloon valvuloplasty. 
13. Multiple and mixed valvular 
heart disease 
13.1. Prevalence and undertreatment 
Patients frequently present with disease of more than one native heart 
valve [multiple VHD (MVHD)], or coexisting stenosis and regurgitation 
of the same valve (mixed VHD).758 While the main cause of MVHD or 
mixed VHD has shifted to degeneration in high-income countries, the 
leading aetiology in low- and middle-income countries remains 
RHD.758,759 Regurgitation of atrioventricular valves secondary to cardiomyopathy or long-standing primary valve disease, and late effects of radiation therapy, are further causes of MVHD.758,760 Challenges in diagnostic 
evaluation coupled with limited data to guide clinical decisions contribute 
to late referral and undertreatment of patients with MVHD.758 
13.2. Evaluation and diagnostic pitfalls 
In view of the complex haemodynamic interplay of multiple and mixed 
valve lesions, assessment by a Heart Team at a Heart Valve Centre and 
use of an integrative multimodality approach is key to gain diagnostic 
certainty, detect cardiac damage, and evaluate therapeutic options.761,762 In the light of paucity of data on diagnostic and prognostic 
parameters in patients with MVHD, assessment largely focuses on 
pathophysiological considerations and evidence derived from isolated 
valve lesions. 
Echocardiography is the main tool to diagnose MVHD, assess mechanism, severity, and associated cardiac damage, and monitor disease 
progression.761 Haemodynamic interdependence between multiple 
valve defects alters the loading and flow conditions, thereby limiting 
the diagnostic validity of measures established to grade single valve defects (Table 9). In the presence of MVHD, low-flow states are frequent. 
The continuity equation becomes erroneous if transvalvular flows are 
unequal, and pressure half-time (PHT)-derived methods are inaccurate 
if the ventricular compliance or filling is altered.761 In this context, 
TOE can provide important detailed anatomical and mechanistic 
flow-independent information.46,761 
If symptoms or echocardiographic findings are equivocal, multimodality diagnostics should be considered on an individual basis to assess 
the cumulative repercussions of MVHD. 
Measures obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing reflect 
the effect of MVHD on functional capacity.52,105,654,761,779 Levels of 
natriuretic peptides such as NT-proBNP correlate with functional 
and echocardiographic parameters, and provide incremental prognostic value in patients with mixed aortic disease and MVHD.98,780 AV calcium scoring confirms the diagnosis of true severe AS under low-flow 
conditions, as described in Section 8.2.777 Cardiac magnetic resonance 
imaging enables the independent assessment of valvular regurgitation 
using volumetric methods or direct flow quantification.45,46,522,762,781 
Importantly, invasive cardiac output-derived measures based on 
thermodilution or the Fick equation using estimated oxygen uptake 
are inaccurate in low-flow conditions or severe TR, commonly present in MVHD.782 
13.3. Indications for intervention 
Given the heterogeneity of clinical scenarios and the lack of evidence on 
optimal treatment pathways, it is recommended that patients with 
MVHD are evaluated for intervention by a collaborative Heart Team 
at a Heart Valve Centre with experience in multimodality imaging 
and treatment of complex VHD.16,764 
Patients presenting with a lesion fulfilling criteria for an intervention 
based on recommendations for single VHD should be treated accordingly. In the remaining patients, assessment of symptoms and functional 
status, as well as cardiac damage (which may be masked by the consequences of concomitant lesions and occur before symptoms manifest), 
is required. The risk–benefit ratio of intervention needs to take into 
account diagnostic (un)certainty, the mechanisms and severity of 
MVHD, and patient-specific factors, as well as procedural options and 
risks to determine the mode, timing, and sequence of valve treatment. 
13.3.1. Multiple valvular heart disease 
Multiple VHD with primary (as opposed to secondary) valvular disease 
usually requires surgical treatment of all relevant valvular lesions. 
Simultaneous treatment of concomitant severe valve defects is recommended and treatment of concomitant moderate AS, or moderate TR, 
should be considered (Recommendation Table 11).

Transcatheter treatment options are established for severe AS 
(TAVI), rheumatic MS (PMC), and primary MR and TR (TEER or transcatheter replacement) in patients with MVHD at high surgical risk, if 
anatomy is suitable.401,783 In the context of a transcatheter strategy, 
a staged approach—typically beginning with the downstream lesion 
(aortic, followed by mitral and tricuspid)—is generally preferred to 
avoid potential haemodynamic deterioration.784,785 
MVHD with severe secondary regurgitation of both atrioventricular 
valves is usually the consequence of either HFrEF with ventricular SMR 
and secondary TR, or atrial dilatation leading to both atrial MR and TR

(often TR > MR). While surgery aims to address all relevant valve lesions 
in a single procedure, a stepwise transcatheter strategy offers the possibility of reassessing the upstream valve(s) under altered loading conditions, usually 3 months after the initial intervention. In very selected 
cases simultaneous transcatheter valve treatment may be considered.788,789 However, evidence is limited and primarily derived from 
modestly sized observational studies.786–789 
13.3.2. Mixed aortic valve disease 
The severity of mixed AV disease is often underestimated and patients 
with balanced moderate AR and AS show adverse event rates comparable to patients with severe isolated AS.790,791 
Transvalvular gradients measured by Doppler reflect the overall 
haemodynamic burden of both regurgitation and stenosis, and are strongly associated with adverse outcomes.765,791–793 Therefore, the presence 
of high transvalvular gradients justifies valve intervention in patients 
with moderate mixed AV disease, even if regurgitation is graded as moderate and the calculated or planimetric AVA is >1 cm2 (Recommendation 
Table 12). Patients presenting with mixed AV disease, but with gradients 
below thresholds for intervention, should undergo careful multimodality 
diagnostics including assessment of cardiac damage to inform individual 
treatment strategies. Global longitudinal strain and natriuretic peptides 
have shown incremental prognostic value beyond symptom status and 
single lesion severity in patients with preserved LVEF.762,794–796 
13.3.3. Mixed mitral valve disease 
Mixed MV disease is usually present in patients with rheumatic valve disease or MAC. If MVA is ≤1.5 cm2, recommendations for isolated MS 
apply. However, patients with an MVA of >1.5 cm2 and moderate 
MR may be evaluated for valve replacement based on symptoms, anatomical characteristics, transmitral gradient, and signs of cardiac damage 
such as LA dilatation, AF, or PH.529,674,776,797 
13.4. Follow-up 
Due to the cumulative haemodynamic impact of MVHD or mixed 
VHD, progression of its severity and the development of cardiac damage may be faster than in single VHD.761 Therefore, follow-up intervals 
should be adjusted according to individual patient characteristics. 
14. Management of patients with 
prosthetic valves or valve repair 
14.1. Choice of prosthetic valve 
When choosing between an MHV and a BHV prosthesis for an individual 
patient, age, life expectancy, lifestyle, bleeding and thromboembolic risks, 
possibility of pregnancy, and patient preference should be considered. 
Life expectancy is estimated according to age, sex, comorbidities, ethnicity, 
and geographical area.798 An MHV is preferred in younger patients with 
longer life expectancy and in those with a pre-existing indication for long- 
term OAC (Recommendation Table 13). Generally, a BHV is implanted in 
patients with shorter life expectancy, increased bleeding risk due to frailty 
or comorbidities, in women contemplating pregnancy, and in patients in 
whom stable INRs with adequate times in therapeutic range are unlikely.799 
Importantly, the performance of different BHV prostheses can vary considerably.800 The impact of the aetiology of the native valve disease, if any, on 
the choice between an MHV and a BHV remains unexplored. 
Several large observational studies, smaller RCTs, and meta-analyses 
have compared long-term mortality with BHV and MHV prostheses in 
patients aged 50–70 years.376,801–805 Some of the studies showed 
lower mortality with an MHV in AV patients <60 years and MV patients 
<65 years old,801,804 while others failed to show any differences.376,802,803 Most of these studies were limited by their observational nature and missing information on the type of prostheses 
implanted. RCTs with sufficient statistical power comparing biological 
and mechanical prostheses are warranted. 
Replacement of the AV using an autograft (Ross procedure) is an 
alternative to an MHV in young patients that should be performed 
at experienced centres by operators with dedicated expertise (see 
also Section 8).806 General recommendations are summarized in

14.2. Follow-up of patients with prosthetic 
valves 
All patients with prosthetic valves require lifelong clinical and echocardiographic follow-up to detect deterioration of prosthetic function, 
associated cardiac damage, or progressive disease of another valve. 
Serial TTE measurements of transprosthetic gradients, calculation of 
the effective valve area, and evaluation of leaflet motion and morphology should be performed in patients receiving a BHV within 
3 months after valve implantation, again at 1 year, and annually thereafter, or sooner if new cardiovascular symptoms occur.812 TOE is recommended in all cases of suspected prosthetic valve dysfunction or 
endocarditis. In the latter case, CCT and PET-CT are also recommended, if the diagnosis is unclear, and to identify primary or secondary infection foci.5 
Cinefluoroscopy for MHVs and CCT provide useful additional information, if valve thrombus or pannus is suspected.812 Imaging should be 
repeated in the case of thrombolytic and antithrombotic treatment of 
MVH thrombosis, even if gradients are normalized.813 
14.3. Antithrombotic therapy in patients 
with treated valvular heart disease 
14.3.1. Mechanical heart valves 
14.3.1.1. Post-operative anticoagulation and therapeutic targets 
Mechanical heart valves require lifelong treatment with a VKA 
guided by the INR. Bridging with either therapeutic unfractionated 
heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and 
VKA should be initiated within 24 h after MHV implantation, or as 
soon as considered safe. Heparin can be stopped when the INR is 
documented for 2 consecutive days within the therapeutic range 
(Figure 18).814 Two meta-analyses and a prospective study have suggested slightly lower bleeding rates using UFH bridging compared 
with LMWH after MHV replacement or cardiac surgery.814–816 
However, RCTs comparing the timing and dosage of each bridging 
strategy are lacking. 
For all patients with an MHV, lifelong VKA is recommended to 
avoid major thrombotic complications, since cardioembolic or valve 
thrombosis rates without anticoagulation are substantial (12% per 
year and 22% per year for first-generation aortic and mitral MHVs, 
respectively).817 The INR target and range should be chosen considering the type, position, and number of valves, the patient’s thrombotic risk, and comorbidities (see Table 10 and Recommendation 
Table 14). In patients with an MHV developing a major thromboembolic complication despite adequate INR and time in therapeutic 
range (TTR, usually defined as >60%),820 either increased VKA intensity (e.g. INR target and range increased by 0.5 units) or the addition 
of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (75–100 mg/day) should be considered.818 Direct oral anticoagulants or dual antiplatelet therapy 
(DAPT) are contraindicated to prevent thromboembolism in patients 
with an MHV.821–824 
Given the complexity of lifelong VKA therapy due to high intra- 
and interpatient variability, the need for monitoring, drug and food 
interactions,825,826 the narrow therapeutic window, influence of comorbidities, and non-modifiable characteristics (e.g. ageing, genetics, 
and ethnicity), RCTs have shown that patient’s education, as well 
as disease and treatment awareness, significantly improves anticoagulation quality and adherence.827–830 International normalized ratio self-monitoring and/or self-management increase efficacy, but 
not safety, as compared with a standard approach; INR self- 
monitoring can be used by motivated patients after adequate 
training.827–830 
The indication for VKA and DAPT combination in MHV patients 
presenting with acute coronary syndrome is described in the corresponding ESC Guidelines.151,831 In patients with an MHV and an indication for single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) due to symptomatic 
major atherosclerotic diseases and low bleeding risk, low-dose 
ASA in combination with a VKA should be considered, because 
this strategy has been shown to significantly lower the incidence 
of major adverse cardiovascular events.818 However, the combination of antiplatelet agents (single or dual) and VKA increases the 
risk of bleeding,825 and therefore their use should be carefully 
weighted. In a large meta-analysis that included MHV patients, the 
combination of VKA with either ASA or clopidogrel increased clinically relevant bleeding compared with VKA alone (clopidogrel odds 
ratio, 3.55; 95% CI, 2.78–4.54; ASA odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.29– 
1.74), which may be aggravated because of potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions on the cytochrome P (CYP)450s 2C19 and

14.3.1.2. Prevention and management of bleeding 
Since patients with MHVs receive lifelong VKA, strategies to prevent 
bleeding need to be implemented. Proton pump inhibitors reduce 
the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding by approximately 40% in patients taking VKAs825,839,840 and should therefore be prescribed to patients with MHVs, particularly in those with additional bleeding risk 
factors (e.g. elderly, antiplatelet agent co-administration, chronic use 
of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, high INR, or alcohol abuse). 
Randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis did not demonstrate 
a benefit of oral vitamin K1 supplementation in addition to temporary 
VKA cessation in non-bleeding patients with a supratherapeutic INR 
(4.5–10.0), with a trend toward reduced safety, which may be relevant 
for MHV patients.841,842 For non-bleeding patients with an INR of 
>10.0, oral vitamin K1 (2.0–3.0 mg) should be administered, avoiding 
overcorrection.841,843 
In cases of uncontrolled life-threatening or other major bleeding,844 
VKA use must be interrupted and reversal with non-activated 
four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates is preferred over fresh 
frozen plasma, because of higher safety and effectiveness.845–848 A reduced 
starting dose (12.5 rather than 25 IU/kg) in patients with more thrombogenic MHVs may be considered.849 In addition, vitamin K1 should be administered to reverse the effect of VKA. Intravenous route corrects 
INR ∼4 h faster than oral administration,850 with no differences at 24 h 
and an unknown clinical impact. VKA should be restarted as soon as major 
bleeding is controlled. 
14.3.1.3. Management of anticoagulation therapy before and after 
non-cardiac invasive procedures 
In patients with an MHV, VKA treatment should not be interrupted for: 
minor or minimally invasive procedures on the skin or eyes (including 
cataract with topical anaesthesia); dental cleaning, treatment of caries, 
and dental extractions; pacemaker implantation; cardiac catheterization; 
and endoscopic procedures (Recommendation Table 15; Table 11).851–856 
Topical antifibrinolytic or haemostatic agents may improve local 
haemostasis.853 
In patients with an MHV and high thromboembolic risk 
(Recommendation Table 16; Table 11) undergoing non-cardiac, elective 
major invasive procedures with high risk of bleeding (see  
Supplementary data online, Table S6), VKA treatment must be interrupted at least 4 days before the procedure, bridging with LMWH 
should be started as soon as the INR reaches a subtherapeutic value, 
and the INR should be <1.5 on the day of surgery.816,857,858 
Measuring anti-Xa activity at peak and trough may be appropriate to 
manage LMWH dosing in selected patients, such as those with severe 
obesity or underweight.859 In cases of urgent, major invasive procedures, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate should be administrated to timely correct the INR for the intervention, if needed. For 
the management of antithrombotic drugs in patients undergoing major 
cardiac surgery, please refer to recent EACTS Guidelines.860

For patients with an MHV and low cardioembolic risk (e.g. a new- 
generation MHV in the aortic position without additional risk factors) 
undergoing elective major NCS or invasive procedures, VKA interruption (3–4 days before surgery)816,857,858,861–864 and resumption861–863 
within 24 h may be performed without bridging to reduce post-surgical 
bleeding without increasing the risk of thrombosis (see Figure 18). 
14.3.2. Biological heart valves 
The management of antithrombotic treatment after BHV implantation 
or valve repair is summarized in Recommendation Table 16 and Figure 19. 
14.3.2.1. Patients with a surgical biological heart valve and no 
indication for oral anticoagulation 
The optimal antithrombotic strategy early after surgical implantation of 
an aortic BHV remains controversial due to the lack of high-quality evidence. Multiple observational studies support the short-term use of 
VKAs to reduce the risk of thromboembolism,865,866 while data on 
DOACs are missing. A small RCT and a meta-analysis found that 
VKA treatment for 3 months significantly increased major bleeding 
compared with low-dose ASA, without reducing mortality or 
thromboembolic events, but statistical power was low.867,868 
Therefore, both strategies (OAC or ASA) are reasonable within 
3 months of surgical aortic BHV implantation. In the absence of randomized evidence, patients undergoing mitral or tricuspid BHV implantation should receive OAC for at least 3 months due to the increased 
risk of AF and thromboembolisms. 
14.3.2.2. Patients with a transcatheter heart valve and no indication 
for oral anticoagulation 
Based on evidence from RCTs, lifelong low-dose ASA is the recommended antithrombotic treatment after TAVI in patients without 
OAC indication. In the Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing 
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (POPular TAVI) trial (cohort 
A), the incidence of bleeding and the composite of bleeding or 
thromboembolic events were both reduced with ASA compared 
with DAPT at 1 year.869 One RCT [Global multicenter, open-label, randomized,

antithrombotic strategy of rivaroxaban (10 mg/day) in combination 
with low-dose ASA compared with DAPT with clopidogrel for the first 
3 months, was halted prematurely due to an increased risk of death or 
thromboembolic complications, and an increased risk of bleeding in 
the rivaroxaban/ASA group.870 The systematic use of DOACs after 
TAVI in patients without indication for OAC is therefore not recommended. Data on antithrombotic management after implantation of 
transcatheter mitral BHVs or tricuspid BHVs are limited. Vitamin K antagonist treatment for ≥3 months is commonly prescribed, while 
DOACs may represent an alternative allowing for earlier discharge 
and a lower risk of short-term bleeding complications (median follow- 
up, 4.7 months).871 
For patients without baseline OAC undergoing mitral or tricuspid 
transcatheter valve implantation, OAC (either with DOAC or VKA) 
is initiated and usually pursued for at least 6 months or indefinitely 
(in particular after valve implantation in the tricuspid position), while 
patients undergoing TEER usually receive single long-term antiplatelet 
therapy with ASA. 
14.3.2.3. Patients with a surgical biological heart valve and an 
indication for oral anticoagulation 
Lifelong OAC is recommended for patients with surgical BHVs with 
other indications for OAC. The evidence supports the use of 
DOACs in preference to VKAs in patients with AF, even during the 
early post-operative period.872–877 A previously existing therapy with 
a DOAC may be continued after BHV implantation and should be restarted, as soon as considered surgically safe, usually within 2–3 days of 
surgery.860 
14.3.2.4. Patients with a transcatheter biological heart valve and an 
indication for oral anticoagulation 
In the POPular TAVI trial (cohort B), the incidence of bleeding over a period of 1 month or 1 year was lower with OAC than with OAC plus clopidogrel.878 Oral anticoagulation alone was non-inferior to OAC plus 
clopidogrel with respect to ischaemic events, but the non-inferiority margin was large. In Edoxaban vs Standard of Care and Their Effects on 
Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic 
Valve Implantation–Atrial Fibrillation (ENVISAGE-TAVI-AF),879 edoxaban 
was non-inferior to VKA regarding the composite primary endpoint 
(death from any cause, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, systemic 
thromboembolic event, valve thrombosis, or major bleeding), but the incidence of major bleeding was higher with edoxaban than with VKA. The 
Anti-Thrombotic Strategy to Lower All Cardiovascular and Neurologic 
Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Events after Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation 
for Aortic Stenosis (ATLANTIS) trial880 showed that apixaban was not 
superior to VKA after TAVI when there was a pre-existing indication 
for OAC, and there was a signal of higher non-cardiovascular mortality 
with apixaban. Therefore, no definitive recommendation can be made 
concerning the use of VKAs vs DOACs in patients who have undergone 
TAVI with a pre-existing indication for OAC. 
Antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter MV or TV implantation 
remains empirical because data are limited. A high proportion of patients are already under OAC because of AF (almost 50% of the population with MR and 80%–90% of the candidates for TR treatment). 
Common practice is to continue the pre-existing anticoagulation regimen. Vitamin K antagonists and DOACs have been used in this setting 
with or without combination with ASA.871 However, the high bleeding 
risk of this usually elderly population needs to be taken into 
consideration.

14.4. Management of prosthetic valve 
dysfunction and complications 
Prosthetic valve dysfunction can occur due to intrinsic permanent 
changes to the prosthetic valve (defined as SVD) or non-structural valve 
dysfunction resulting from any abnormality not intrinsic to the prosthetic valve itself. Valve thrombosis and endocarditis are considered 
separate entities due to their specific presentation and management, 
but may both result in SVD. 
14.4.1. Structural valve deterioration 
Structural valve deterioration has been defined by several consensus 
documents812,895,896 and includes wear and tear, leaflet disruption, 
leaflet fibrosis or calcification, and stent or strut fracture or deformation. BHV (transcatheter or surgical) SVD is more frequent than 
MHV SVD. The incidence of SVD may be underestimated by the simple 
analysis of patients with valve-related deaths or those undergoing reintervention. To ensure timely diagnosis, serial measurement should be 
performed and compared with the TTE performed at discharge, or 
within 1–3 months after valve implantation. 
The criteria for haemodynamic deterioration associated with 
aortic and mitral SVD can be found in Table 12.895,896 The diagnosis of moderate or severe haemodynamic deterioration should 
prompt referral to an experienced Heart Valve Centre for evaluation and treatment, and to exclude all causes of non-structural 
valve dysfunction, particularly PVL or PPM, as well as thrombosis 
and endocarditis. This step requires the use of advanced 
imaging techniques (TOE, CCT, and/or PET-CT) to document 
SVD-related morphological changes and elucidate its mechanism. 
Structural valve deterioration associated with corresponding clinical criteria (e.g. new onset or worsening of symptoms, LV or RV 
dilation/dysfunction, or PH) indicates BHV failure with potential 
need for reintervention. Decisions about the treatment modality 
(redo surgery or transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation) should 
be made within the interdisciplinary Heart Team, depending on reoperation risk and anatomical considerations,445,897 including the 
risk of coronary obstruction,144,442,446,461 as well as prosthesis 
type and size.898–900 When considering a valve-in-valve procedure 
for a degenerated aortic BHV, the possibility of creating a PPM in 
small valves should be anticipated and may impact intervention or 
valve selection.448 
Given the larger sizes of BHVs in mitral or tricuspid positions, transfemoral/transseptal valve-in-valve implantation represents an attractive 
alternative to redo open surgery.570,900–903 In the case of mitral 
valve-in-valve implantation the risk of LVOT obstruction, although

infrequent, should be carefully ruled out, especially in patients with 
small and hypertrophic ventricles.904 
14.4.2. Non-structural valve dysfunction 
14.4.2.1. Prosthesis–patient mismatch 
Prosthesis–patient mismatch should be prevented whenever possible after either transcatheter or surgical valve-replacement procedures (see Section 8.5.1.2). When occurring in the aortic 
position, severe PPM is associated with decreased quality of life, increased rate of rehospitalization and reintervention, and possible 
reduction in long-term survival, although findings are not consistent 
throughout all studies.454,905–909 Moderate PPM is more common, 
but seems to have a limited impact on outcomes. The projected 
indexed EOA may be predicted prior to valve implantation to 
avoid severe PPM,908 although this concept has been challenged.910 
Less is known about the prevalence and consequences of PPM in 
the mitral and tricuspid positions, and established definitions are 
lacking. 
Prosthesis–patient mismatch is an infrequent indication for reintervention. However, reoperation should be considered in symptomatic patients with severe PPM, particularly if the patient is low 
risk.394,437,438 
14.4.2.2. Paravalvular leak and haemolysis 
The diagnosis of PVL requires systematic TOE, because TTE may be 
inconclusive. Haemolytic anaemia can often be detected in patients 
with prosthetic valves and is best assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase and haptoglobin serum levels, but rarely leads to symptoms. Intervention is needed if a PVL causes haemolysis requiring 
blood transfusions or symptoms, or if secondary to valve endocarditis. 
Transcatheter PVL closure is a valid alternative to surgery in the case 
of significant regurgitation or haemolysis, if feasible depending on the 
size and location of the leak, but requires specific expertise and planning. Care must be taken not to interfere with mechanical leaflet motion in MHV patients. Reported results for transcatheter PVL closure 
are inconsistent, with several patients returning with recurrent PVL 
and/or haemolysis.911 When surgery or transcatheter intervention 
are contraindicated, medical therapy aims to counteract the effect 
of haemolysis (iron supplementation and erythropoietin) or reduce 
it (beta-blockers).912 
14.4.3. Endocarditis 
Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in all patients with a prosthetic valve (including transcatheter valve prostheses) and after valve 
repair using prosthetic material or with previous episode(s) of infective endocarditis, and should also be considered after transcatheter 
MV or TV repair.5 It is recommended in such patients when undergoing dental extractions, oral surgery, or other procedures requiring 
manipulation of the gingival or peri-apical region of the teeth. 
Particular attention to dental and cutaneous hygiene, and strict 
aseptic measures during any invasive procedure, are also advised in 
this population. Additional details on endocarditis prophylaxis are 
mentioned in the 2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of 
endocarditis.5 
14.4.4. Valve thrombosis 
Valve thrombosis occurs mainly in MHVs,913,914 but can also be observed in BHVs.915,916 The spectrum of BHV thrombosis ranges 
from incidental CCT findings, such as hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) with or without reduced leaflet motion but normal 
gradients, to clinically apparent presentations with elevated 
gradients, symptoms of valve obstruction, or thromboembolic 
events.917–919 
14.4.4.1. Hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening 
Hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening is detected by CCT in 10%–30% of 
aortic BHVs depending on antithrombotic management, the definition 
of HALT, the timepoint of assessment, and the type of valve.917,919–921 
The significance and clinical implications of these findings with respect 
to thromboembolic risk and valve durability remain uncertain. 
Accordingly, routine use of CCT to detect HALT is not indicated.918–920 In patients with relevant increases in gradients, in 
whom HALT and restricted leaflet motion is confirmed by CCT, 
elective use of DOACs or VKAs should be considered to resolve leaflet thrombosis.918,921,922 
14.4.4.2. Clinically significant valve thrombosis 
Obstructive valve thrombosis should be suspected in any patient 
with any type of prosthetic valve who presents with new-onset 
dyspnoea or HF symptoms, an embolic event, or an unexpected increase in transvalvular gradients. If TTE findings are uncertain, the 
diagnosis should be confirmed by TOE and/or CCT to distinguish 
between 
thrombus, 
pannus, 
and 
degeneration.923–925 
Cinefluoroscopy can detect impaired MHV leaflet motion and reduced opening angles. 
Adequate anticoagulation must be promptly restored in all patients 
with MHV thrombosis and subtherapeutic INR. Although surgery remains the first-line option in critically ill patients, emergency valve replacement is associated with increased risk, whereas bleeding and 
systemic embolism are increased with fibrinolysis.926–928 Slow, low- 
dose infusion appears to lower complication rates, while preserving 
thrombolytic success rates.928–931a It is recommended that the decision between surgery and fibrinolysis is taken within the Heart 
Team, and individualized by weighing clinical factors and local expertise (Figure 20). 
Management of non-obstructive thrombosis or obstructive 
thrombosis of an MHV without pronounced HF symptoms depends mainly on the occurrence of a thromboembolic event 
and the size of the thrombus. Surgery should be considered for 
a large (>10 mm) non-obstructive prosthetic valve thrombus 
that is complicated by embolism or persists despite optimal 
OAC.913,932,933 
Anticoagulation using a VKA is the first-line treatment for clinically 
relevant BHV thrombosis, unless urgent reintervention or fibrinolysis is required due to progressive acute HF or haemodynamic 
instability.934–938 Because clinically relevant BHV thrombosis is associated with recurrence and may contribute to prosthetic degeneration, indefinite anticoagulation may be considered after a 
confirmed episode, but this strategy must be balanced against the 
risk of bleeding.936,939

### 15 Management during

non-cardiac surgery 
In patients with significant VHD who undergo NCS, the risk of peri- 
operative cardiovascular complications is increased and related to 
both the timing of the procedure (i.e. urgent vs non-urgent) and type 
of surgery (low, intermediate, or high risk), as well as patient-specific 
factors (type and severity of VHD, LV function, etc.).194,957–959 
Detailed recommendations related to NCS are available in the 2022 
ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular assessment and management of patients 
undergoing non-cardiac surgery.960 
15.1. Pre-operative evaluation 
Echocardiography should be performed in all patients with VHD requiring 
NCS. Patient- and surgery-specific factors, along with risk calculators, can 
be used to guide the treatment strategy. Determination of functional capacity is a pivotal step for pre-operative risk assessment, measured either by 
the ability to perform activities in daily life or by exercise testing. Screening 
for frailty using validated tools is advisable.90 Decisions on pre- and peri- 
operative management, surveillance, and continuation of chronic cardiovascular medical treatment should be taken after multidisciplinary discussion involving cardiologists, surgeons, and cardiac anaesthesiologists, as 
well as the team who will be in charge of the NCS. Patients receiving 
OAC treatment should be managed as described in Section 14. 
15.2. Specific valve lesions 
15.2.1. Aortic stenosis 
In patients with severe symptomatic AS, the treatment depends on the 
urgency and risk of NCS. If life-saving time-sensitive NCS is needed, it 
should be performed under careful haemodynamic monitoring avoiding 
rapid changes of volume status, with prompt treatment of arrhythmia regardless of AS severity. In cases of urgent high-risk NCS, TAVI or balloon 
aortic valvuloplasty should be considered in patients with critical AS prior 
to surgery, considering the risk of developing severe acute AR after

balloon aortic valvuloplasty.194,961 Urgent low- and intermediate-risk 
NCS can be performed relatively safely in patients with severe AS.962 
Patients in whom NCS can be deferred (i.e. non-urgent NCS) 
should undergo pre-operative Heart Team evaluation to determine 
whether SAVR or TAVI is preferable. TAVI may be preferred to 
SAVR if faster recovery plays a role, particularly in elderly patients 
in whom complex or high-risk NCS is planned.963 The treatment of 
asymptomatic patients with severe AS should be individualized 
(Figure 21).964 
15.2.2. Mitral stenosis 
Heart rate and fluid balance should be controlled to prevent pulmonary 
oedema during NCS and arterial vasodilators should be avoided. 
Non-cardiac surgery is safe in patients with an MVA of >1.5 cm2, and in 
asymptomatic patients with MVA ≤1.5 cm2 and SPAP of <50 mmHg. 
Symptomatic patients or those with SPAP of >50 mmHg should undergo 
PMC or other appropriate valve intervention before high-risk NCS, if possible.965,966 Asymptomatic patients with MVA ≤1.5 cm2 can undergo 
low-to-moderate-risk NCS under careful monitoring, especially if PMC 
is unsuitable. Multidisciplinary management is advised for patients with significant MS who are ineligible for valve intervention. 
15.2.3. Aortic and mitral regurgitation 
Non-cardiac surgery can usually be performed safely in asymptomatic patients with severe MR or AR and preserved LV function. If NCS is urgent, 
patients should undergo surgery under strict haemodynamic monitoring, 
regardless of symptom status. In cases of elective (non-urgent) NCS in 
patients with severe ventricular SMR, medical therapy should be optimized. If symptoms persist and NCS is intermediate or high risk, TEER 
should be considered after Heart Team discussion based on clinical

and anatomical selection criteria.194,584 Valve treatment should be performed for patients with AR meeting the criteria for valve intervention 
before any elective intermediate- or high-risk NCS.966,967 
15.3. Peri-operative monitoring 
Heart rate control (particularly in MS) and careful fluid management 
(particularly in AS and MR with reduced LVEF) are needed throughout 
the procedure. The involvement of specialized cardiovascular anaesthesiologists should be considered in complex situations because TOE 
monitoring may be considered. Pulmonary artery catheterization is 
not routinely used. 
16. Management of valvular heart 
disease during pregnancy 
Specific ESC Guidelines on this topic are available (the 2025 ESC 
Guidelines on cardiovascular disease during pregnancy) and should be consulted for further details.968 Pregnancies in patients with VHD should 
be considered high risk and managed under the close supervision of a 
cardiologist and a multidisciplinary Pregnancy Heart Team. The importance of midwives and other specialized nursing personnel is increasingly 
recognized for high-quality direct patient interactions. Shared decision- 
making is especially important when addressing the cardiovascular risk 
of pregnancy and the benefit–risk ratios of therapeutic options and 
modes of delivery (Figure 22). 
16.1. Management before pregnancy 
Ideally, women should undergo a thorough physical examination by 
their general practitioner for VHD screening prior to pregnancy. A specialized evaluation including TTE should be performed by a cardiologist 
in the case of clinical suspicion.968,969 
If VHD is diagnosed, pre-pregnancy counselling is imperative. 
Unplanned pregnancies in patients with VHD should be discouraged. 
Contraception methods should be recommended after discussion 
with the patient in the presence of a significant maternal and/or foetal 
risk. In patients contemplating pregnancy, the maternal risk should be 
assessed using the modified WHO classification and other scores such 
as the CARPREG or DEVI risk score (see Supplementary data online,  
Table S7).970

Before recommending pregnancy, the following conditions need to 
be corrected: 
• MS with MVA <1.5 cm2, even when asymptomatic.971 
• Severe AS with symptoms, or abnormal exercise test, or LV systolic 
dysfunction.972 
• Heritable aortic disorders and high risk of aortic dissection: prophylactic 
aortic repair is recommended prior to pregnancy in women with 
Marfan syndrome and an aortic diameter of >45 mm, and may be considered in women with an aortic diameter between 40 and 45 mm 
when risk factors for dissection exist.973 Aneurysmal dilation in women 
with BAV should be corrected when the aortic diameter is ≥50 mm.974 
Close follow-up in dedicated units and beta-blocker therapy during 
pregnancy and post-partum are recommended unless contraindicated, 
although strong evidence is only available for Marfan syndrome.  
Valvular regurgitant lesions are generally well tolerated during pregnancy. Prophylactic intervention is therefore not recommended in the 
absence of class I or IIa indications. 
The first therapeutic option for MS in a woman considering pregnancy should be PMC. When implantation of a prosthetic valve is necessary, BHVs are recommended, although early SVD remains a 
serious concern.975 Mechanical heart valves must be avoided due to 
the high risk of maternal and foetal complications linked to the potential 
teratogenic effects of VKAs, as well as the increased risk of bleeding.976 
The Ross procedure may be considered for the treatment of AV disease at centres with expertise. 
16.2. Management during pregnancy 
16.2.1. Patients with native valve disease 
Pregnancy can worsen the clinical course of left-sided stenotic valvular 
lesions because increased cardiac output causes an increment of transvalvular gradient of ∼50%, mainly between the first and second trimesters. Regurgitant lesions are less likely to cause complications, except 
in high-risk cases (LV systolic dysfunction, PH, and cardiac events before 
pregnancy).977 
Mild MS is generally well tolerated.978 Heart failure occurs in 
one-third of pregnant women with an MVA of <1.5 cm2 and in one-half 
of those with an MVA of <1.0 cm2, most often during the second trimester.971 Percutaneous mitral commissurotomy should be considered if symptoms or SPAP of >50 mmHg persist despite optimal 
medical therapy (diuretics and beta-1-selective beta-blockers), preferably after the 20th week of pregnancy. 
Regarding AS, pregnancy is generally well tolerated if prior exercise 
tolerance was normal, even in severe AS, while HF has been reported 
to occur in up to 25% of symptomatic patients.972 In symptomatic 
patients despite medical therapy (i.e. diuretics), TAVI seems to be 
the preferred option in very selected patients, although evidence is 
lacking. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty may be an alternative option. Procedures should be performed in an experienced valve 
centre.972,979,980 
Surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a high rate 
of foetal loss and should be restricted to conditions that threaten the 
mother’s life if transcatheter intervention is not possible or has failed. 
Vaginal delivery is the first choice for the majority of patients. 
Caesarean section is preferred if there is an obstetric indication, 
and in the case of severe MS or AS, ascending aortic diameter of 
>45 mm, severe PH, or if delivery starts while the patient is being 
treated with OAC. 
16.2.2. Patients with prosthetic valves 
Pregnant patients with MHVs should be followed in a centre with corresponding expertise. In a cohort of 212 women with MHVs, valve 
thrombosis occurred in 10 (4.7%) pregnancies and haemorrhagic 
events occurred in 49 (23.1%).976 Therapeutic OAC during pregnancy 
is essential to avoid thrombosis. The higher efficacy of VKAs compared 
with LMWH to prevent thrombosis must be balanced against increased 
foetal risks.981 
In patients requiring ≤5 mg/day of warfarin, OAC with warfarin 
throughout pregnancy, changing to UFH before delivery, is advocated, 
in order to reduce the risk of thrombosis. In patients requiring higher 
doses, switching to dose-adjusted LMWH at least twice per day with 
strict anti-Xa monitoring during the first trimester is recommended 
to avoid the teratogenic effect of VKAs (for corresponding flowcharts 
see the 2025 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy968). 
Lifetime management of women with a BHV considering pregnancy 
is central and transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation may be considered as a bridge to MHV implantation.982 
17. Sex-specific considerations 
in patients with valvular heart 
disease 
Although men and women are equally likely to experience VHD, sex- 
specific prevalence exists according to valve type and disease pathophysiology.644,648,983 Women more frequently suffer from MV disease 
such as prolapse, RHD or TR, while men more often present with AS or 
AR, especially associated with BAV.984 Men also suffer from endocarditis of any valve more frequently.985 
Female sex is associated with higher mortality in the presence of various VHDs,986 including early post-treatment,987 and is included as a 
risk factor in surgical risk prediction tools such as the STS and 
EuroSCORE calculators. However, risk scores are often derived 
from populations including a majority of men.988 In addition, risk prediction scores are susceptible to referral bias that results in a well- 
established higher risk of undertreatment or delayed treatment of 
VHD in women.983,984,986 
17.1. Aortic valve disease 
Female patients with severe AS present more often with shortness of 
breath, whereas males more frequently have angina, presumably due to 
the higher incidence of CAD.989 The pathophysiology of AS seems to 
differ according to sex, with women having less calcium and more fibrosis.990 Concentric ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling are also 
more frequently observed in women than in men, resulting in higher 
LVEF but smaller LV cavity and stroke volume.991 Consequently, paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient constellations are frequent and may 
both contribute to the underdiagnosis of severe AS in women and delay 
an intervention.992 The use of sex-specific thresholds to define flow 
limitation (<40 mL/m2 for men and <32 mL/m2 for women) has therefore been suggested,292 and the use of CCT to quantify the calcium 
score should be performed in women with discordant echocardiographic parameters.777 
Women are less likely to be referred to a cardiologist and 
undergo investigations. Surgical aortic valve replacement is performed less frequently in women, especially if echocardiographic 
parameters are discordant.993 In patients presenting with severe  
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               69

AS and Class I indications for SAVR, a significantly higher proportion 
of men than women are referred for evaluation by a cardiac 
surgeon.994,995 
Male patients derive a clearer benefit from SAVR compared with women, who have higher in-hospital and long-term mortality and morbidity,987,996 possibly explained by more severe concentric hypertrophy991 
and a smaller aortic annulus predisposing to PPM.997 Conversely, in a 
randomized trial (RHEIA) that compared TAVI with SAVR in 443 women with a mean age of 73 years, TAVI was superior in reducing the 
primary endpoint composed of death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 
1 year, predominantly driven by a reduction in rehospitalization for 
valve- or procedure-related symptoms or worsening HF.998 Several observational studies suggest that elderly women have lower mortality 
after TAVI,999 even if the rates of major vascular complications and 
bleeding tend to be higher.997 
Indexed cut-offs to indicate treatment of AR are validated, but only 
partially account for sex differences. Newer studies using echocardiographic volumes1000 and CMR1001 suggest that women may experience 
higher event rates at lower cut-offs compared with men, but this requires further investigation. 
17.2. Mitral valve disease 
Patients with RHD are often young women and have a high prevalence 
of major cardiovascular complications with far-reaching impacts on reproductive health and access to care.282 Although women experience 
favourable outcomes compared with men when treated by percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty, access to these procedures is still limited 
in low-income countries.662 
Fibroelastic disease with MV prolapse is also more frequent in women, and may be accompanied by morphological abnormalities of 
the MA associated with fibrosis of the papillary muscles or the inferobasal LV that may act as the substrate for sudden cardiac death, 
even in the absence of severe MR.1002 Recent evidence has supported considering lower women-specific cut-offs for intervention 
with regard to LVESD (36 mm; indexed LVESD, 1.8 cm/m2), while 
the LVEF cut-off was similar to men (58%), albeit with higher 
mortality.548 
Ventricular SMR associated with low LVEF is more frequent in men 
with HF,1003 while atrial SMR due to chronic AF and/or HFpEF affects 
more women (58% vs 42% male).579 
Female sex is a risk factor for the development of MAC and was reported to account for 68% of the patients included in a large-scale 
transcatheter MV replacement in MAC registry.1004 Furthermore, women present with a faster disease progression.1005 
17.3. Tricuspid valve disease 
Tricuspid regurgitation is more prevalent in women,208 and female 
sex is associated with accelerated disease progression.1006–1008 
Hypotheses to explain these observations include the overall higher 
prevalence of HFpEF and AF in women.1009 Women are usually 
diagnosed at an older age and the cause of TR is most frequently 
a consequence of left valvular disease or annular dilatation attributable 
to RA dilatation.1010 No differences have been detected to date 
in terms of adverse events after surgery1011 or transcatheter TV 
interventions.1012,1013 
18. Key messages 
Heart Team and Heart Valve Centre 
• An integrated regional Heart Valve Network incorporating outpatient Heart Valve Clinics and specialist Heart Valve Centres allows 
optimal patient care. 
• Heart Valve Centres should fulfil institutional and local statutory requirements, and strive for high procedural volume and excellent clinical outcomes. 
• Heart Team recommendations should be based upon these guideline 
recommendations, relevant updated evidence, key medical considerations, and patient preferences. 
• Core members of the Heart Team include the primary clinical cardiologist, cardiologists with subspecialty expertise in VHD, specialists in 
advanced cardiovascular imaging and peri-procedural imaging guidance, and surgeons and interventional cardiologists with training 
and expertise in valve interventions. 
• A network approach that distinguishes between higher- and 
lower-volume centres is appropriate, with more complex procedures focused in the most experienced (i.e. upper quartile) 
centres. Information on the network organization should be communicated to patients, as well as referring cardiologists and general 
practitioners.  
Aortic regurgitation 
• Assessment of AR severity with TTE remains challenging and current 
cut-offs for intervention are mostly based on 2D measurements, although 3D echocardiography and CMR allow more accurate evaluation of LV volumes and LVEF. 
• Mechanisms of AR may be closely related to the aortic diameters that 
should be measured accurately at all levels of the aortic root (annulus, 
sinuses, and sinotubular junction). 
• Indication for operation is based on symptoms, LV volumes, LVEF, 
and aortic diameters. Although valve replacement remains the standard treatment, AV repair (or AV sparing when associated with root 
aneurysm) is being increasingly used to avoid prosthesis-related complications, especially in experienced centres. 
• Current transcatheter options for AR are limited and applicable only 
in patients who are ineligible for surgery.  
Aortic stenosis 
• Diagnosis of severe AS requires integrative evaluation of pressure 
gradients (the most robust measurements), AVA, flow conditions, 
the extent of valve calcification, and LV function. 
• Selection of the most appropriate mode of intervention should take 
into account clinical characteristics (age and estimated life expectancy, concomitant conditions), access and valve anatomy (particularly 
the feasibility of transfemoral TAVI and calcification patterns), and 
surgical risk, as well as repeat procedure options and risks (lifetime 
management).  
Mitral regurgitation 
• The echocardiographic diagnostic workup of patients with MR includes multiparametric assessment of MR severity, evaluation of


<!-- PAGE 71 -->

### Page 71

MV anatomy (often with 3D TOE), identification of the mechanism 
(PMR, ventricular SMR, or atrial SMR), and evaluation of cardiac 
damage. 
• Surgical MV repair is the preferred method of treatment in severe 
PMR. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is recommended in patients 
who are inoperable or high risk according to the Heart Team. 
• Surgical MV repair is the procedure of choice for asymptomatic patients with primary MR and signs of cardiac damage, including moderate or more TR. 
• In patients with ventricular SMR, GDMT (including CRT if indicated) 
is the initial and essential treatment step. In symptomatic patients 
without CAD needing revascularization, M-TEER is recommended. 
In patients with concomitant complex CAD and those not suitable 
for TEER, mitral surgery may be considered. 
• In patients with atrial SMR, MV surgery, AF ablation if indicated, and 
LAAO should be considered after optimization of medical therapy. 
Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair may be considered in patients at 
high surgical risk.  
Mitral stenosis 
• Most patients with severe rheumatic MS and favourable valve anatomy should undergo PMC, which is the standard of care. Surgery 
is recommended for symptomatic patients with contraindications 
or unfavourable anatomical and clinical characteristics for PMC. 
• Decision-making in patients with unfavourable anatomy should take 
into account local PMC experience. 
• In selected patients with clinically severe degenerative MS and MAC, 
transcatheter intervention or surgery may improve symptoms.  
Tricuspid regurgitation 
• Concomitant TV repair is the preferred method for patients with 
left-sided valve pathology and associated moderate or severe TR. 
• The use of risk scores for the assessment of RV and secondary organ 
dysfunction should be strongly encouraged in patients with isolated 
severe TV disease. 
• In isolated severe TR without severe RV dysfunction, surgery should 
be performed at an early stage in patients at low operative risk. 
• In isolated severe TR patients at increased surgical risk, tricuspid 
TEER or transcatheter replacement should be considered to improve quality of life and RV remodelling, in the absence of severe 
RV dysfunction or pre-capillary PH.  
Tricuspid stenosis 
• TS is a very rare manifestation of acquired VHD in high-income 
countries. 
• TS is mainly associated with rheumatic valve disease, carcinoid syndrome, or enzymatic disorders such as Fabry’s or Whipple’s disease. 
• Treatment of symptomatic TS mainly involves surgical TV 
replacement.  
Multiple and mixed valvular heart disease 
• Transvalvular gradients and velocities reflect the combined burden of 
regurgitation and stenosis in mixed aortic and mitral disease. 
• Treatment decisions should be based on the assessment of symptom 
and functional status, cardiac damage, anatomical suitability, and the 
risk–benefit ratio of intervention and lifetime management 
considerations. 
• Patients with mixed moderate AS and AR have similar detrimental 
outcomes compared with those with severe isolated AS. 
• In transcatheter procedures, which allow a sequential approach, 
downstream lesions should be treated first to prevent potential 
haemodynamic deterioration and allow improvement of upstream 
lesions due to changing loading conditions and reverse 
remodelling.  
Antithrombotic treatment in patients with a mechanical 
heart valve 
• International normalized ratio therapeutic range should be balanced 
to the type and anatomical site of MHV, as well to the thrombotic risk 
profile of the individual patient. 
• Patient training, self-monitoring, and education can increase INR stability and TTR. 
• Minor or minimally invasive NCS procedures do not require VKA 
interruption in patients with an MHV. 
• In patients with an MHV undergoing elective major NCS, bridging 
may be omitted if the thromboembolic risk is low.  
Non-cardiac surgery 
• The risk of peri-operative cardiovascular complications related to 
surgery and to patient-specific factors should be evaluated and communicated to the patient and surgical team. 
• In patients with symptomatic severe AS requiring urgent high-risk 
NCS, BAV or TAVI should be considered prior to surgery. In patients 
planned for elective NCS, AV intervention is recommended prior to 
NCS.  
Pregnancy 
• In women with VHD, decisions regarding management before and during pregnancy should be taken after discussion by the multidisciplinary 
Pregnancy Heart Team. Unplanned pregnancies should be discouraged. 
• The following conditions should be corrected prior to considering 
pregnancy: 
– clinically severe MS (MVA <1.5 cm2), even when asymptomatic 
– severe symptomatic AS, or asymptomatic patients with impaired 
LV function or a pathological exercise test 
– heritable aortic disorders and high risk of aortic dissection. 
• Vaginal delivery is the first choice for the majority of patients. 
Indications for Caesarean section include pre-term labour in patients 
on OAC, severe MS or AS, aggressive aortic pathology, acute intractable HF, and severe PH. 
• Women with MHVs should be managed in expert centres.  
19. Gaps in evidence 
General aspects 
• Patient-reported outcome measures are infrequently reported 
in VHD studies. Patient-reported outcome measure-oriented studies 
are required to improve quality of life and patient satisfaction. 
• Methods to address underdiagnosis and undertreatment of VHD 
need to be identified and implemented.  
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               71

Heart Team and Heart Valve Centre 
• Structured research is required to investigate the relationship between procedural volume and clinical outcomes, in order to define 
minimum annual thresholds for individual operators and institutions 
undertaking surgical and transcatheter valve interventions. 
• There is a pressing need to ensure higher dispersion and adoption of 
interventions for VHD, especially in middle- and low-income countries.  
Conditions associated with valvular heart disease 
• CAD: 
– The prognostic value of functional assessment of stable, moderate 
coronary stenosis in VHD patients remains to be determined. 
– The optimal strategy (invasive vs non-invasive) for CAD assessment in specific VHD populations remains to be elucidated. 
– The optimal timing of PCI in patients with CAD undergoing TAVI 
is yet to be determined. 
– The benefit of complete coronary revascularization with CABG in 
patients with combined VHD and CAD requires further research. 
• AF: 
– It is unclear which patients with chronic persistent AF and concomitant VHD are deemed to be suitable for rhythm control 
therapy. 
– The protective effect against stroke of OAC with VKA or DOACs 
in patients after surgical or transcatheter LAAO remains to be 
determined. 
• Cardiogenic shock and acute HF: 
– The optimal treatment strategy in VHD patients presenting with 
cardiogenic shock and acute HF is unknown.  
Aortic regurgitation 
• Impact of early LV remodelling on prognosis in asymptomatic AR patients is unknown. 
• Prognostic value of CMR-derived indices in asymptomatic patients 
needs to be determined. 
• More data are required on long-term results of surgical AV repair for AR. 
• More evidence is required on transcatheter treatment options for 
AR, in particular using dedicated devices.  
Aortic stenosis 
• Better understanding of the pathophysiology of AS is needed to propose innovative medical therapy. 
• Further research is required on: 
– Refined prognostic markers to guide timing of intervention in 
asymptomatic patients. 
– The role of revascularization in patients with severe AS and asymptomatic concomitant CAD. 
– Further data on the long-term durability of transcatheter valves in 
comparison with surgical BHVs in younger patients. 
– The role of TAVI in patients with BAV AS and patients <70 years 
of age. 
– Results of intervention (valve or coronary) after TAVI or SAVR. 
– Determining the optimal lifetime management strategy for AS 
patients.  
Mitral regurgitation 
• The association between primary MR and ventricular arrhythmias requires more investigation, including the impact of intervention on 
ventricular arrhythmias. 
• More data are required on the role of TEER in patients with advanced HF. 
• Long-term results of TEER need to be further assessed, including the 
clinical relevance of transmitral gradients after treatment of both primary and secondary MR. 
• Results of ongoing trials comparing MV surgery with TEER in non- 
high risk primary MR patients are awaited. 
• Data on the mid- and long-term clinical impacts of transcatheter MV 
replacement are required. 
• More data on the clinical impacts of surgical and transcatheter treatment of atrial SMR are required.  
Mitral stenosis 
• The potential role of TMVI using dedicated devices in high-risk 
patients is to be determined, particularly those with severe 
MAC.  
Tricuspid regurgitation 
• The long-term risks and benefits of concomitant TV surgery in patients with less than moderate TR and annular dilatation undergoing 
left-sided valve surgery need to be determined. 
• Further investigations are required on the outcomes of TV intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe TR and RV dysfunction or 
significant dilation. 
• The importance of addressing concomitant AF in patients with TR 
needs to be investigated. 
• More data are required on the indications, timing, and long-term outcomes of TV repair and replacement for TV disease. 
• Better understanding is required of the respective role of surgery vs 
transcatheter TV therapy for TR treatment.  
Tricuspid stenosis 
• The role of transcatheter TV replacement remains unexplored in patients with TS. The most efficient way to achieve ventricular pacing in 
patients after TV replacement needs to be investigated.  
Multiple and mixed valvular heart disease 
• Further evaluation of the impact on outcomes and indication for 
intervention, as well as timing and modalities of intervention, is 
required.  
Prosthetic valves 
• Further development of current prosthetic valve devices is required 
to address their main complications (e.g. improved tissue processing 
to reduce degeneration of bioprostheses or new mechanical valve 
designs to reduce risk of thrombosis). 
• Antithrombotic drugs in MHV patients: 
– Whether UFH or LMWH should be preferred as bridging therapy 
after MHV implantation, as well as their timing and dosage, remains 
to be established. 
– For patients with MHV undergoing major NCS, the optimal post- 
operative management and bridging of VKA needs further 
investigation. 
– The role of pharmacogenomics for VKORC1, CYP2C9, and 
CYP4F2 in patients with highly variable INR, and low TTR or major 
vascular complications despite good adherence, should be further 
investigated. 
– More data on the risks and benefits of slow thrombolysis for valve 
thrombosis are required.

Pregnancy 
• More data are required on optimal management of anticoagulation in 
pregnant women with MHVs. Prospective studies comparing different antithrombotic regimens are lacking.  
Non-cardiac surgery 
• Clinical utility of scales for peri-operative risk evaluation needs to be 
determined.  
Sex-specific considerations 
• The development of sex-adjusted surgical risk prediction tools is required. 
• Additional data are needed to validate sex-specific cut-offs indicating 
interventions. 
• Further research is needed to investigate sex-related differences in 
the prognosis and treatment of specific valve diseases, especially 
TR.
