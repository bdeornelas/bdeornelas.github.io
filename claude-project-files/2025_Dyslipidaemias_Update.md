1. Preamble
Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of as­
sisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic 
approach for an individual patient with a given condition. The European 
Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines are intended for use by health 
professionals but do not override their individual responsibility to make 
appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s 
health condition and in consultation with the patient or the patient’s care­
giver where appropriate and/or necessary aiming at shared care decisions. 
It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and reg­
ulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of pre­
scription and to respect the ethical rules of their profession.
The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on 
a given topic. Guideline topics are selected for updating after 
annual expert review of new evidence conducted by the ESC Clinical 
Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee. ESC Policies and Procedures 
for formulating and issuing the ESC Guidelines can be found on the 
ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice- 
Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines).
Interim Focused Updates are created when the publication of new 
evidence could influence clinical practice before the next full update 
of a Guideline is published. This Focused Update provides new and re­
vised recommendations for the 2019 ESC/European Atherosclerosis 
Society (EAS) Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias. View 
the full 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines here: https://doi.org/10.1093/ 
eurheartj/ehz455. This Task Force was selected by the ESC and EAS 
to include professionals involved with the medical care of patients 
with this pathology as well as methodologists.
Guidelines Task Forces perform a critical review and evaluation of 
the published literature on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches 
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                                 3

including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Recommendations are 
based on major randomized trials and relevant systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses, when available. Systematic literature searches 
are conducted in cases of controversy or uncertainty to ensure that 
all key studies were considered. For recommendations related to 
diagnosis and prognosis, additional types of evidence are included, 
such as diagnostic accuracy studies and studies focused on the devel­
opment and validation of prognostic models. The strength of each 
recommendation and the level of evidence supporting it are weighed 
and scored according to predefined criteria as outlined in Tables 1
and 2. Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and Patient- 
Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) are also evaluated when avail­
able as the basis for recommendations and/or discussion in these 
Guidelines.
Evidence tables summarizing key information from relevant studies 
are generated to facilitate the formulation of recommendations, to

enhance comprehension of recommendations after publication, and to 
reinforce transparency in the Guidelines development process. The ta­
bles are published in their own section of the Focused Update and ref­
erence specific recommendation tables.
After an iterative process of deliberations, a first Task Force vote on all 
recommendations is conducted prior to the initiation of rounds of re­
view. A second Task Force vote on all recommendations is conducted 
after the final round of review and revision. For each vote, the Task 
Force follows ESC voting procedures and all recommendations require 
at least 75% agreement among voting members to be approved. 
Voting restrictions may be applied based on declarations of interests.
The writing and reviewing panels provide declaration of interest forms 
for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of 
conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest are reviewed according 
to the ESC declaration of interest rules which can be found on the ESC 
website (http://www.escardio.org/doi) and are compiled in a report pub­
lished in a supplementary document with the Guidelines. Funding for the 
development of this ESC/EAS Focused Update was derived entirely from 
the ESC and EAS with no involvement of the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG Committee supervises and co-ordinates the prepar­
ation of new Guidelines and Focused Updates and approves their publi­
cation. In addition to review by the ESC CPG Committee, this ESC/EAS 
Focused Update underwent multiple rounds of peer review on a dedi­
cated online review platform. The review was conducted by topic ex­
perts, including members from ESC National Cardiac Societies and 
from relevant ESC Subspecialty Communities. The Focused Update 
Task Force considered all review comments and was required to re­
spond to all those classified as major. After appropriate revisions, the 
Task Force and the ESC CPG Committee members and the EAS 
Executive Committee approved the final document for publication in 
the European Heart Journal and in Atherosclerosis.
Unless otherwise stated, the Focused Update content refers to sex, 
understood as the biological condition of being male or female, defined 
by genes, hormones and sexual organs. Off-label use of medication may 
be presented in this Focused Update if a sufficient level of evidence 
shows that it can be considered medically appropriate for a given con­
dition. However, decisions on off-label use must be made by the re­
sponsible health professional giving special consideration to ethical 
rules concerning healthcare, the specific situation of the patient, patient 
consent, and country-specific health regulations.
2. Introduction
Since the publication of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the 
management of dyslipidaemias: lipid modification to reduce cardio­
vascular (CV) risk,1 there have been several randomized controlled 
trials that might change patient management ahead of the next sched­
uled full dyslipidaemia Guidelines. This 2025 Focused Update ad­
dresses changes in recommendations for the treatment of 
dyslipidaemias based on new evidence published up until 31 March 
2025. All major randomized controlled clinical trials and 
meta-analyses published after the publication of the 2019 ESC/EAS 
Guidelines were presented and discussed in detail before a consensus 
was reached about any possible classes of recommendations (see 
Table 1) and levels of evidence (see Table 2) to be assigned; these 
were then voted upon for inclusion by all Task Force members. 
Members with declared conflicts of interests in specific topics were 
asked to abstain from voting on those topics.
The Task Force considered and discussed the following new studies, trials, 
and any meta-analyses: Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) 
and Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2-Older Persons (SCORE2-OP) 
for estimation of 10 year CV risk;2,3 CLEAR Outcomes [Cholesterol 
Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL (adenosine triphosphate-citrate 
lyase)-Inhibiting Regimen];4 ELIPSE HoFH (Evinacumab Lipid Studies in 
Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia);5 APPROACH 
(Reduction of Triglyceride Levels in Familial Chylomicronemia 
Syndrome);6 REPRIEVE (Pitavastatin to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease in 
HIV Infection);7 STRENGTH (Long-Term Outcomes Study to Assess 
Statin Residual Risk with Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients 
with Hypertriglyceridemia);8 STOP-CA (Atorvastatin for Anthracycline- 
Associated Cardiac Dysfunction);9 SPORT (Supplements, Placebo, or 
Rosuvastatin Study);10 and OMEMI (Omega-3 Fatty acids in Elderly with 
Myocardial Infarction).11 Beside these trials, the Task Force also considered 
and discussed: combination therapy with high-dose statin plus ezetimibe and 
intensification of lipid-lowering therapy during the index hospitalization for 
patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), as well as new 
data on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a risk modifier.
Only results that would lead to new or changed Class I/IIa or Class III 
recommendations were selected for inclusion in Recommendation 
Tables. All new recommendations included in this Focused Update are 
additive to the recommendations of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for 
the management of dyslipidaemias, and all changed recommendations 
substitute those of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management 
of dyslipidaemias.
After due deliberation, the Task Force decided to update recom­
mendations for the following sections of the 2019 ESC/EAS 
Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: 
• Recommendations for CV risk estimation, with implementation of 
the new SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP risk prediction algorithms.
• Recommendations 
on 
low-density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol 
(LDL-C)-lowering therapies, including two new agents for LDL-C- 
lowering treatment (bempedoic acid and evinacumab specifically for 
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia)(FH).
• Recommendations for lipid-lowering therapy during index hospital­
ization of ACS.
• Recommendations on Lp(a).
• Recommendations 
for drug 
treatment 
in 
patients 
with 
hypertriglyceridaemia.
• Recommendations for statin therapy in primary CV disease (CVD) 
prevention for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection.
• Recommendations for statin therapy for patients with cancer at high 
or very high chemotherapy-related CV toxicity risk.
• Recommendations for dietary supplements.
3. Estimation of total 
cardiovascular risk and implications 
for dyslipidaemia management
Atherosclerosis is caused by the progressive deposition of LDL-C and 
other apolipoprotein-B (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins within the ar­
tery wall, which triggers a cascade of inflammatory reactions leading 
to the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaque. As more 
atherogenic lipoproteins become accumulated within the arterial wall 
over time, the atherosclerotic plaque gradually enlarges and the risk 
of having an acute atherosclerotic CV event increases. LDL-C is not 
only a risk factor for atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD), but like 
other ApoB-containing lipoproteins is a direct cause of ASCVD;12
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                                 5

therefore, lowering plasma LDL-C levels should be the main focus for 
preventing atherosclerotic CV events.
In clinical practice, the concentration of circulating LDL-C that can 
become trapped within the artery wall is estimated by measuring plas­
ma levels of LDL-C, which represent the total amount of cholesterol 
carried by low-density lipoproteins. The objective of estimating a per­
son’s risk of having an atherosclerotic CV event is to identify individuals 
at elevated risk who may benefit from interventions to lower LDL-C 
and other modifiable causes of ASCVD. The clinical benefit of lowering 
LDL-C depends on the achieved LDL-C reduction; therefore, indivi­
duals with higher CV risk require more intense LDL-C lowering to 
achieve the same absolute level of residual CV risk while on treatment 
as compared with individuals with lower risk. For example, assuming an 
average 20% proportional (relative) reduction in risk per each mmol/L 
lower LDL-C,13 lowering LDL-C by 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) would re­
duce the risk of a person with a 20% absolute risk of having an acute 
atherosclerotic CV event to 16% (i.e. a 20% relative but 4% absolute 
risk reduction), whereas it would reduce the risk of a person with a 
10% absolute risk to 8% (a 20% relative but 2% absolute risk reduction). 
This Focused Update continues to endorse the concept supported in 
the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines1 that a person’s estimated absolute 
risk of having an acute CV event should be used to guide the intensity 
of LDL-C lowering. We also acknowledge that the CV risk reduction 
achievable by a similar magnitude of lowering atherogenic lipid levels ap­
pears to be greater at younger ages.14,15
Numerous randomized trials have demonstrated that lowering 
LDL-C reduces the risk of both fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarc­
tions (MI) and ischaemic strokes13 as well as ischaemic events in 
peripheral arterial territories.16 Therefore, because CVD morbidity 
(non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke) combined with CVD mortality bet­
ter reflects the total burden of ASCVD, and in line with the current 
dorses the use of risk scores such as SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP (in­
stead of the SCORE algorithm) for estimation of the risk of 
experiencing an MI, ischaemic stroke, or fatal atherosclerotic CV event 
over the next 10 years in persons without known CVD aged between 
40 and 89 years (Recommendation Table 1).
While calculation of the SCORE was based on each person’s total 
cholesterol level, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol 
(which is calculated as total cholesterol minus HDL-C) is used as an 
input in the SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP risk algorithms. Moreover, 
while the SCORE algorithm assessed the 10 year risk of fatal CVD 
in persons aged up to 70 years, the SCORE2/SCORE2-OP algorithms 
(accessible at http://www.heartscore.org) can estimate 10 year risk for 
both fatal and non-fatal CV events also for apparently healthy people 
aged ≥70 years (up to 89 years). SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP are cali­
brated to four clusters of countries (low, moderate, high, and very 
high CVD risk) based on national CVD mortality rates;2,3 details and 
risk charts for these country clusters are in the 2021 ESC Guidelines 
on CVD prevention.17
Table 3 presents the updated definitions for very high, high, moder­
ate, and low CVD risk, using the SCORE2/SCORE2-OP instead of the 
SCORE algorithm for apparently healthy persons (primary prevention). 
This table is intended to replace Table 4 of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines.1
As a general concept, it is estimated that the risk of total CVD events is 
2–3 times higher than the risk of fatal CVD events, although this may

vary considerably according to age and sex. In this Focused Update, a 2× 
multiplier was used to convert previous SCORE-based thresholds17 into 
the SCORE2- or SCORE2-OP-based thresholds to define different cat­
egories of total CVD risk. Notably, this Task Force continues to emphasize 
that risk is a continuum and cut-off points that are used in any CVD risk 
model to define different levels of risk are, in part, arbitrary and based on 
the risk levels at which benefit is evident in clinical trials. Therefore, the 
SCORE2- and SCORE2-OP-based thresholds presented in this document 
(Table 3) reflect this concept.
Because existing population-based CVD risk models are relatively 
crude tools for individual risk prediction,18 attention to additional char­
acteristics that are known to increase CV risk is reasonable in order to 
refine risk assessment, as already discussed in the 2021 ESC Prevention 
Guidelines.17 This is particularly relevant for persons around treatment 
decision thresholds (Recommendation Table 1). Clinical conditions and 
selected biomarkers that can be considered as risk modifiers are sum­
marized in Box 1. Their presence may support reclassifying an individual 
to a higher risk category than would be calculated by the SCORE2 
or SCORE2-OP algorithm, and may thereby guide decisions about 
LDL-C goals and lipid-lowering interventions.
This Focused Update endorses the Class IIa recommendation of the 
2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines1 that arterial (carotid and/or femoral) plaque 
burden should be considered as a risk modifier in individuals at low or

moderate risk. Recent studies have provided important new evidence 
regarding the clinical risk associated with subclinical atherosclerosis 
documented on coronary or peripheral arterial imaging in persons 
without clinical ASCVD.19 While there are no randomized trials 
showing that the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) to classify 
CV risk and guide therapeutic management improves CV outcomes, 
nevertheless consideration of CAC improves both discrimination 
and reclassification.20 An elevated CAC score has been associated 
in a graded fashion with a higher risk of adverse CV events in persons 
without clinical ASCVD (primary prevention);21–23 at markedly ele­
vated CAC values (e.g. CAC score >300), the risk was similar or 
even higher than the risk of patients with known clinical ASCVD 
(secondary prevention).24,25 Conversely, a CAC score of zero has 
been associated with a lower risk of ASCVD events and mortality 
in persons at low to moderate estimated CV risk.26 Consideration 
of CAC improves the accuracy of predicted CVD risk by means of 
the SCORE2 algorithm.27 While the presence of significant (typical­
ly, obstructive) plaque on invasive or computed tomography 
(CT)-based coronary angiography was defined as a feature of very 
high CV risk in the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines,1 the presence of 
less advanced coronary atherosclerosis with non-obstructive pla­
ques was more recently shown to be associated with an increased 
risk of subsequent MI.28 Against this background, while coronary im­
aging or CAC measurement are not indicated as broad screening 
tests for the purpose of CV risk estimation, this Focused Update includes 
a new recommendation that the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis 
by imaging or increased CAC score, if measured, should be considered 
as risk modifiers in individuals at moderate risk or individuals around 
treatment decision thresholds (Recommendation Table 1). It should be 
noted, however, that statin therapy may lead to a decrease in lipid-rich 
plaque and an increase in calcification, indicating plaque stabilization;29,30
therefore, CAC score should be interpreted with caution in statin- 
treated patients.
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without ASCVD, 
the 2023 ESC Guidelines for CVD management in patients with dia­
betes recommend the use of the SCORE2-Diabetes algorithm to esti­
mate 10 year CVD risk.31,32
It is important to note that the LDL-C treatment goals (Figure 1) and 
therapeutic guidance (Table 4) for persons in each risk category have 
not changed from the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines.1 The intensity of 
the recommended LDL-C lowering continues to be determined by a 
person’s level of risk. Previous studies indicated potential underestima­
tion of CV risk based on the SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP,18 and under­
treatment with lipid-lowering therapy in primary prevention if statins 
were to be recommended only for persons at very high risk.33
Importantly, however, as outlined in the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines,1
the recommendation to initiate pharmacological LDL-C-lowering ther­
apy in primary prevention is not restricted to persons at very high risk, 
but depends on both the estimated CV risk and the baseline (untreat­
ed) LDL-C levels (Table 4). This concept was previously illustrated in

 recurrent vascular events while taking
 maximally tolerated statin-based therapy
• Patients with polyvascular (e.g. coronary
 and peripheral) arterial disease

Table 5 of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines, and is now described (without 
changes vs the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines) in Recommendation Table 1.
We further emphasize that the SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP risk- 
estimating algorithms were derived from cohorts of participants 
without clinical ASCVD who were not receiving lipid-lowering ther­
apy. As a result, these algorithms should not be used to estimate risk 
among persons with existing ASCVD or among persons currently on 
lipid-lowering therapy, and they should not be used to ‘re-assess’ 
risk using lipid measurements obtained after initiating Guideline- 
recommended lipid-lowering therapy.
Finally, this Task Force emphasizes that atherosclerosis is a chronic 
progressive disease that begins early in life and slowly progresses 
over time, and the cumulative exposure to higher LDL-C levels at 
younger ages is associated with a higher ASCVD risk later in life.34
Conversely, exposure to lower levels of atherogenic lipids at younger 
ages has the potential to reduce the lifetime risk of developing 
CVD35 and mitigate further progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.15
The discrepancy between our understanding of the biology of how ath­
erosclerosis develops and the practical consequences of informing 
treatment decisions based on 10 year risk underscores the need to de­
velop a new generation of risk- and benefit-estimating algorithms. 
These algorithms should: (i) accurately estimate the lifetime risk of hav­
ing an acute CV event for all individuals regardless of age, and (ii) pro­
vide personalized guidance on the optimal timing and intensity of 
LDL-C lowering needed by each person to reduce their remaining life­
time risk of developing an atherosclerotic CV event.
4. New low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol-lowering therapies
Bempedoic acid is an oral small molecule that inhibits cholesterol syn­
thesis by inhibiting the action of ATP-citrate lyase, a cytosolic enzyme 
upstream of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 
pathway.40 Bempedoic acid is a prodrug and the activating enzyme 
(very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1) is not expressed in skeletal 
muscle.41 Treatment with bempedoic acid has muscle-related adverse 
events similar to placebo.40,42 Bempedoic acid (single dose available, 
180 mg/day) reduces LDL-C levels by approximately 23% as mono­
therapy, approximately 18% when given on a background of statin ther­
apy,40,42 and by 38% when given in a fixed-dose combination with 
ezetimibe.43,44 Treatment with bempedoic acid decreased C-reactive 
protein and did not result in increased haemoglobin A1c levels in pa­
tients with normoglycaemia or pre-diabetes.45 Mendelian randomiza­
tion studies have demonstrated that a genetic variant mimicking the 
effect of ATP-citrate lyase inhibition and lowering plasma LDL-C levels 
by the same mechanism of action is associated with similar reductions in 
the risk of CVD as statins and other non-statin lipid-lowering drugs with 
proven benefit per unit decrease in LDL-C levels.46
The CLEAR Outcomes study was a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study that aimed to determine bempedoic acid’s 
potential for CV risk reduction in statin-intolerant patients at high 
risk of developing major adverse CV events (MACE) during a median

of 40.6 month follow-up.4 A total of 13 970 patients were randomized, 
with approximately 70% in secondary prevention and 30% in primary 
prevention. Patients taking a small dose of a statin (daily dose of ator­
vastatin <10 mg or equivalent) were allowed and constituted 23% of 
the trial population. The time-averaged difference in LDL-C between 
the bempedoic acid and placebo arms was 0.57 mmol/L (22 mg/dL). 
Treatment with bempedoic acid reduced the rate of MACE, defined 
as a composite of death from CV causes, MI, stroke, or coronary revas­
cularization, by 13% [hazard ratio (HR), 0.87; 95% confidence interval 
(CI), 0.79–0.96; P = .004). There was no apparent effect on CV death 
(HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88–1.24). Cardiovascular risk reduction with bem­
pedoic acid is similar to that achieved with statins for a given absolute 
magnitude of LDL-C lowering.47 The rate of myalgia was similar in 
the two arms. Treatment with bempedoic acid increased the risk of 
having elevations in hepatic enzymes [>2× upper limit of normal 
(ULN) for either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate amino­
transferase (AST), 4.5% vs 3.0%], renal impairment (11.5% vs 8.6%), hy­
peruricaemia (10.9% vs 5.6%), gout (3.1% vs 2.1%), cholelithiasis (2.2% 
vs 1.2%), increased platelet count (7.2% vs 0.8%), and decreased haem­
atocrit levels (2.3% vs 0.1%). Because bempedoic acid leads to a small 
and reversible increase in uric acid, caution is required in patients 
with a history of gout, even though gout does not constitute an abso­
lute contraindication to bempedoic acid.
New recommendations for the use of bempedoic acid for LDL-C 
lowering [complementing the recommendations for pharmacological 
LDL-C lowering with statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the 
2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines1] are shown in Recommendation Table 2. 
Figure 2 summarizes the average percentage reduction in LDL-C levels 
with different pharmacological therapies, alone or in combination. It 
should be kept in mind that there is considerable inter-individual vari­
ability in the LDL-C-lowering response to any given lipid-lowering 
drug or combination, which necessitates monitoring of the treatment 
effects after initiation or adaptation of any LDL-C-lowering therapy. 
As outlined in the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines,1 LDL-C levels should 
be measured 4 to 6 weeks after initiation or intensification of 
lipid-lowering therapy.
Inclisiran, a small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule that in­
hibits the synthesis of PCSK9, may represent an alternative approach to 
PCSK9 mAbs (alirocumab and evolocumab). Inclisiran has been shown 
in phase III trials to lower LDL-C levels by approximately 50%.48 Two 
CV outcome trials with inclisiran [>16 000 patients with CVD 
(NCT03705234) and 17 000 patients with established ASCVD 
(NCT05030428)] are currently ongoing and expected to report their 
primary outcomes in 2026 and 2027, respectively.
In patients with homozygous FH, in whom statins and PCSK9 inhibi­
tors have little efficacy and may not suffice to adequately lower LDL-C 
levels,49 evinacumab, an mAb against ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3), 
has shown potential benefits with a reduction of LDL-C close to 
50%.5,50,51
Patients who are unable to take statins because of adverse effects re­
present a challenge in clinical practice. In such cases, the addition of a 
non-statin lipid-modifying agent to a maximally tolerated statin is a valu­
able therapeutic option.1 New evidence supporting the reduction in the 
risk of ASCVD events with ezetimibe in the absence of statin therapy 
(although not necessarily due to statin intolerance) in older persons

aged ≥75 years without history of coronary artery disease was pro­
vided in the randomized, open-label EWTOPIA 75 (Ezetimibe 
Lipid-Lowering Trial on Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular 
Disease in 75 or Older).52 As a general concept, this Task Force recom­
mends to add non-statin therapies with proven cardiovascular benefit, 
such as ezetimibe, a PCSK9 mAb, or bempedoic acid, taken alone or in 
combination, to lower LDL-C if the LDL-C goals are not achieved with 
the maximum tolerated dose of a statin; the choice should be based on 
the magnitude of additional LDL-C lowering needed, patient prefer­
ence, treatment availability, and cost.
5. Combination of lipid-lowering 
therapies during index 
hospitalization for acute coronary 
syndromes
A clear association between intensive lipid-lowering therapies and bet­
ter outcomes in patients after ACS was demonstrated two decades 
ago,56,57 supporting ‘the lower the better’ principle for LDL-C reduc­
tion in this clinical setting. Lipid-lowering therapy is one of the pillars 
of the management of these patients, both in the early post-ACS set­
ting58 and in the chronic, stabilized period after an ACS.59 Patients ex­
periencing ACS are at particularly elevated risk of recurrent CV events, 
especially within the first year after hospital discharge.60 Observational 
data show a 10% cumulative incidence of a second MI, a stroke, or CV 
death within the first 100 days after experiencing an MI,61 reaching 33% 
at 5 years.62 Even in an ideal post-ACS scenario, it can take up to 12 
weeks for patients to receive optimal LDL-C-lowering therapy follow­
ing the current stepwise approach that was recommended in the 2019 
ESC/EAS Guidelines.1 This early post-ACS period corresponds to the 
most vulnerable phase after a major coronary event. Observational 
data show that Guideline-directed, intensive lipid-lowering therapy is 
infrequently prescribed, with few dose adjustments performed after 
hospital discharge,63 and that the majority of patients do not achieve 
their goals.17,64,65 The reasons for this are multifactorial and may in­
clude prescription inertia (prescription of lower-intensity statin), sub­
optimal patient adherence related to side effects of lipid-lowering 
therapies or reluctance to being treated with statins,59 and delays or 
losses to follow-up after discharge from index hospitalization.
The IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy 
International Trial) study showed that the addition of ezetimibe to statin 
therapy (simvastatin 40 mg) within <10 days (median 5 days) after an ACS 
event resulted in incremental lowering of LDL-C levels and a modest but 
significant reduction of adverse CV events.66 Small studies have recently 
demonstrated that very intensive LDL-C-lowering treatment initiated in 
the acute phase after ACS is safe, feasible, and effective in getting more 
patients to recommended LDL-C goals.67–69 In addition, recent data 
from the HUYGENS70 (High-Resolution Assessment of Coronary 
Plaques 
in 
a 
Global 
Evolocumab 
Randomized 
Study) 
and 
PACMAN-AMI71
(Effects of the PCSK9 Antibody Alirocumab 
on Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients With Acute Myocardial 
Infarction) trials reported improvements in coronary plaque size and 
composition in response to acute and very intensive LDL-C reduction 
in the vulnerable post-ACS population. A continuous reduction in CV ad­
verse events has been described even when LDL-C reduction exceeded 
current Guideline-recommended treatment goals.72–74 Recent data from 
the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and 
Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated 
According to Recommended Therapies) Registry reported the lowest 
risk of CV events in those patients who achieved early and sustained 
LDL-C lowering to recommended goals after MI. A stepwise approach 
for LDL-C lowering after MI might therefore result in delayed goal attain­
ment as compared with early intensification of treatment.75,76 These data 
support ‘the sooner, the lower, the better’ as a therapeutic strategy for 
LDL-C lowering in patients with ACS.58
As the extent of LDL-C reduction in response to pharmacological in­
terventions is predictable based on baseline LDL-C levels, it is reasonable 
to assume that a significant proportion of ACS patients will not achieve 
their target goal with high-intensity statin treatment alone, prescribed at 
discharge.77 Therefore, and in line with the current 2023 ESC Guidelines 
for the management of patients with ACS,58 this Task Force proposes a 
strategy of early, intensive LDL-C lowering to be considered in all pa­
tients with ACS, with immediate initiation of statin therapy and combin­
ation treatment with one or more classes of non-statin therapy with 
proven CV benefit as needed, depending on each patient’s lipid-lowering 
therapy prior to the ACS event. The choice of drug for combination 
therapy should be based on the magnitude of additional LDL-C lowering 
required. Several drugs and drug combinations with various efficacies and 
onsets of action are available to enable such a ‘strike early and strong’ ap­
proach (Figure 2). Recommendation Table 3 includes two new recommen­
dations for this clinical setting, for patients who present either with or 
without pre-existing lipid-lowering therapy at the time of the ACS event. 
Beyond the treatment in the acute ACS phase, LDL-C should be checked 
4 to 6 weeks after initiation or intensification of lipid-lowering therapy,

and lifelong treatment to lower LDL-C levels to recommended targets is 
strongly recommended.1
Several ongoing clinical trials, such as EVOLVE-MI (EVOLocumab 
Very Early After Myocardial Infarction; NCT05284747) and 
AMUNDSEN-real [Evolocumab or normal strategies to reach LDL 
objectives in acute myocardial infarction upbound to PCI (percutan­
eous coronary intervention); EUDRACT:20210–005738–0], are in­
vestigating the potential benefit of introducing evolocumab at the 
time of the ACS event. The results of these trials are expected in 
2026–2027.
6. Lipoprotein(a)
Epidemiologic and genetic studies strongly support a likely causal and dir­
ect continuous association between high plasma levels of Lp(a) and high­
er risk of ASCVD and aortic valve stenosis (AVS).78 Emerging data are 
suggesting that high Lp(a) may confer a higher risk of ASCVD and AVS 
per particle or cholesterol content than LDL-C.37,79–84 The mechanisms 
by which Lp(a) and LDL lead to these increased risks therefore likely dif­
fer.78 Based on studies from the United Kingdom, Denmark, and the 
United States of America, the highest risks were for MI and AVS, less 
in peripheral artery disease and heart failure, and the lowest risks were 
for ischaemic stroke and CV and all-cause mortality.37,78,79,85–90 Risk 
from high Lp(a) increases slightly at levels of 30 mg/dL (62 nmol/L) to 
50 mg/dL (105 nmol/L) and becomes clinically relevant above 50 mg/dL 
(105 nmol/L), with higher levels associated with a greater increase in 
CV risk. Lp(a) concentration is predominantly determined by genetics 
(>90%), more than any other lipoprotein, and levels vary with ethnicity.83
There is an incremental increase in risk caused by higher Lp(a) levels, and 
if Lp(a) level is not considered, risk might be substantially underestimated 
(Figure 3).78 Lp(a) measurement should be considered at least once in 
every adult’s lifetime,1 either at the first lipid profile or at the next one 
if lipid profiles have previously been performed. Screening is particularly 
relevant in younger patients with FH or premature ASCVD and no other 
identifiable risk factors, or a family history of premature ASCVD or high 
Lp(a) levels, or in individuals at moderate risk or around treatment deci­
sion thresholds to improve risk classification. Lp(a) levels may increase 
after menopause and a second measurement is reasonable, particularly 
if the pre-menopausal levels were borderline.78,91 For Lp(a) measure­
ment, there is substantial variability among different assays, in part relat­
ing to apo(a) structure and variability in Kringle-IV repeats, potentially 
under- or overestimating Lp(a) levels. Although measurement in molar 
units (nmol/L) is preferred, mass units (mg/dL) can be used for clinical 
purposes.
Although Lp(a) has not yet been shown to improve risk prediction 
on top of currently recommended scores (SCORE2, SCORE2-OP), 
another study testing whether elevated Lp(a) could improve MI risk 
prediction beyond conventional risk factors showed that Lp(a) con­
centrations >47 mg/dL reclassified 23% of first MI events correctly, 
while no events were reclassified incorrectly, in a cohort of 8720 
individuals.84
Whether lowering Lp(a) reduces the risk of ASCVD and AVS pro­
gression has yet to be shown; the extent of Lp(a) lowering required 
for clinical benefit is also not known. In the absence of specific 
Lp(a)-lowering therapies, early risk factor management and more in­
tensive LDL-C lowering is reasonable, considering both absolute CV 
risk and Lp(a) levels.78 An online Lp(a) risk and benefit algorithm 
is available at http://www.eas-society.org/LPA_risk_and_benefit_ 
algorithm. Although small studies have suggested that statins may 
have a slight Lp(a) increasing effect, individual-level data on partici­
pants in seven randomized, placebo-controlled, statin outcome 
trials found that statins had no effect on Lp(a) concentrations.92
Therefore, clinical decision-making should be influenced by the de­
gree of Lp(a) elevation and the patient’s other risk factors, and pa­
tients with high levels of Lp(a) should be strongly encouraged to 
take or continue to take high-intensity statins if their risk is sufficiently 
high.93
Currently, there are specific Lp(a)-lowering medications being tested 
in randomized clinical trials. The injectable RNA (either antisense oligo­
nucleotide or small interfering RNA)-based therapies that target apoli­
poprotein(a) production in the hepatocyte lower Lp(a) concentration 
by 80%–98%.94–97 An oral small molecule inhibitor and a small interfer­
ing RNA that can lower Lp(a) significantly are currently under investi­
gation.98–100
Recommendation Table 4 includes a new recommendation reflecting 
the increase in CV risk across the spectrum of elevated Lp(a) levels.1 It 
is reasonable to consider elevated Lp(a) levels >50 mg/dL (≥105 nmol/ 
L) (affecting at least 20% of the population)83 in order to refine CV 
risk estimation across the spectrum of CV risk; moreover, this cut-off le­
vel should be considered as a risk modifier to potentially reclassify the CV 
risk category specifically in individuals at moderate risk or individuals close 
to treatment decision thresholds (see Box 1 and Recommendation 
Table 1).

### 7 Hypertriglyceridaemia

Triglyceride levels are associated with CV risk independent of LDL-C 
levels.102–104
With 
respect 
to 
pharmacological 
treatment 
of hypertriglyceridaemia, this Task Force continues to recommend 
statins as the first drug of choice to reduce CVD risk in high-risk 
patients.1
Currently available fibrates (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, bezafibrate) 
have moderate triglyceride-lowering effects.105–107 Fenofibrate and be­
zafibrate lead to small decreases in LDL-C, but have not reduced MACE 
(MI, ischaemic stroke, CV mortality) or total mortality in patients trea­
ted with statins. A reduction in non-fatal MI was only seen in subgroup 
analyses of patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia (low HDL-C and 
high triglycerides) in these trials.105,106 In a pre-specified subgroup ana­
lysis of the FIELD (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering 
in Diabetes) trial, fenofibrate was associated with a lower risk of 
lower-limb amputations, likely not mediated by lipid-related mechan­
isms.108 The PROMINENT (Pemafibrate to Reduce Cardiovascular 
OutcoMes by Reducing Triglycerides IN PatiENts With DiabeTes) trial 
recently showed that the selective peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor (PPAR-a) modulator pemafibrate109 did not reduce the risk 
of MACE in 10 497 patients with T2DM, mild-to-moderate hypertrigly­
ceridaemia and low HDL-C levels; notably, pemafibrate increased ApoB 
and LDL-C levels in that trial. Overall, in contrast to the robust evidence 
of ASCVD risk reduction with LDL-C lowering therapies, the efficacy of 
triglyceride lowering with fibrates in reducing ASCVD risk has not been 
established. This Focused Update supports the Class IIb recommenda­
tions of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the use of fenofibrate or be­
zafibrate.1 Fibrates are not indicated to lower serum cholesterol or 
LDL-C levels.110
Regarding n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the STRENGTH 
trial was published following the publication of the 2019 ESC/EAS 
Guidelines.1 The trial failed to demonstrate benefit of a combined 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prepar­
ation in 13 078 patients (70% with diabetes; 56% with established 
ASCVD) in lowering MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, non- 
fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina 
requiring hospitalization).8

Reasons for the discordant results of the negative STRENGTH trial 
vs those of the positive REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular 
Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial),111 which were pub­
lished 2 years earlier, may be related to differences in the study popu­
lations, active treatment compounds (mixture of EPA and DHA vs 
high-dose icosapent ethyl, i.e. a highly purified EPA ethyl ester, re­
spectively), or placebo formulation (corn oil vs mineral oil-containing 
placebo, respectively).112–114 Proposed mechanisms of action of how 
EPA specifically reduces cardiovascular risk are the distinct effects on 
lipid oxidation, inflammation, membrane structure/organization, chol­
esterol domain formation, and endothelial function.115,116 In view of 
the newer evidence from the STRENGTH trial, this Focused 
Update revised the respective recommendation for PUFAs by expli­
citly stating that high-dose icosapent ethyl (as in the REDUCE-IT trial) 
should be considered for high-risk or very high-risk patients with ele­
vated triglyceride levels (fasting triglyceride level 135-499 mg/dL 
[1.52-5.63 mmol/L]) despite statin therapy to lower CVD events 
(Recommendation Table 5).
Volanesorsen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting hepatic apoli­
poprotein C-III (ApoC-III) messenger RNA that lowers plasma levels of 
ApoC-III, triglycerides, and chylomicrons. In a phase III, double-blind, 
randomized 52 week trial including 66 patients with familial chylomicro­
naemia syndrome (FCS) and markedly elevated triglyceride levels 
(mean baseline levels 2209 mg/dL [24.96 mmol/L]), volanesorsen was 
shown to lower triglyceride levels by 77% within 3 months; levels 
<750 mg/dL (<8.48 mmol/L) were achieved in 77% of volanesorsen- 
treated patients. Common adverse events include thrombocytopenia 
requiring frequent monitoring and injection-site reactions in 60% of 
the patients treated with volanesorsen.6 A meta-analysis of individual 
patient data from three randomized controlled trials including pa­
tients with triglyceride levels >500 mg/dL (>5.65 mmol/L) (n = 207) 
showed a significant reduction in the risk of acute pancreatitis during 
a median follow-up of 8.1 months.117 Volanesorsen has been ap­
proved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [but not by the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] as an adjunct to diet in adult 
patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancrea­
titis in whom response to diet and triglyceride-lowering therapy has 
been inadequate. This drug should be considered for patients with 
severe hypertriglyceridaemia due to FCS (new recommendation in 
Recommendation Table 5).
Currently, new triglyceride-lowering medications are being 
tested in randomized clinical trials. Injectable RNA-based therapies 
(either antisense oligonucleotide or small interfering RNA) targeting 
ApoC-III can lower triglyceride concentrations by up to 80% 
depending on the dose, interval, specific agent, and patient popula­
tion.118–121
8. Primary prevention in people 
with human immunodeficiency 
virus infection
People with HIV (PWH) have a two-fold increased risk of ASCVD com­
pared with the general population.17,122 Underlying mechanisms in­
clude chronic inflammation, immune activation, dyslipidaemia caused 
by antiretroviral therapy (ART), and traditional CV risk factors.123
Cardiovascular risk is often underestimated in PWH using conventional 
risk prediction tools.124 In the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines,1 the recom­
mendation was that lipid-lowering therapy (mostly statins) should be 
considered in HIV patients with dyslipidaemia to achieve the LDL-C 
goal as defined for high-risk patients (Class IIa, Level C). The recently 
published REPRIEVE trial justifies an update in the recommendation 
for statins in PWH. REPRIEVE was a multicentre, randomized, double- 
blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 7769 participants in pri­
mary prevention with HIV, aged 40 to 75 years with low-to-moderate 
ASCVD risk receiving ART.7 Patients were randomized to pitavastatin 
4 mg once daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was MACE, a com­
posite of CV death, MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, stroke, tran­
sient ischaemic attack, peripheral arterial ischaemia, revascularization, 
or death from an undetermined cause. The trial was stopped prema­
turely for efficacy after a median follow-up of 5.1 years, and showed 
a 35% lower incidence of MACE in the pitavastatin vs the placebo 
group (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48–0.90; P = .002). Efficacy was similar 
for men and women—an important finding as women have a higher 
risk of HIV-associated ASCVD.125 Of note, rates of muscle-related 
symptoms and new-onset diabetes were higher in PWH treated with 
pitavastatin (2.4% vs 1.3% and 5.3% vs 4.0%, respectively). The 5 year 
number needed to treat to prevent one MACE was 106. In the 
REPRIEVE trial, pitavastatin 4 mg daily did not interact with antiretro­
viral drugs; as co-administration of certain statins and specific antiretro­
viral drugs may result in significant drug interactions, the choice of statin 
should be based on potential drug interactions.126 The new recommen­
dation in this Focused Update for statin therapy in PWH aged ≥40 
years in primary prevention is included in Recommendation Table 6.
Although outcome trials of other lipid-lowering therapies have not 
been performed in PWH, data on LDL-C reduction and tolerability 
are available for ezetimibe and PCSK9 mAbs.
Ezetimibe as monotherapy or in combination with statin therapy re­
duces LDL-C levels in PWH receiving ART to a similar extent as in peo­
ple without HIV and is well tolerated, although available studies are 
small.127–129 Regarding PCSK9 inhibitors, a randomized, double-blind 
trial including 464 PWH receiving ART (35.6% with documented 
ASCVD) showed that evolocumab reduced LDL-C levels by 56.9%

9. Patients with cancer at high or 
very high chemotherapy-related 
cardiovascular toxicity risk
Anthracycline-based chemotherapy is a key component of several 
chemotherapy regimens for many types of cancer (e.g. breast cancer 
or lymphoma). Its use is associated with the development of heart fail­
ure in up to 20% of patients within 5 years, depending on the accumu­
lated dose received.131
Recently, four randomized trials assessed the cardioprotective role 
of statins in patients with cancer receiving anthracycline-based ther­
apy.9,132–134 The STOP-CA trial was a multicentre, double-blind, ran­
domized controlled trial comparing atorvastatin 40 mg daily against 
placebo in 300 patients with lymphoma. The primary endpoint, defined 
as the proportion of patients with ≥10% absolute decline in left ven­
tricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to a final LVEF value <55% at 12 
months, occurred more frequently in the placebo compared with the 
atorvastatin group (22% vs 9%, respectively; P = .002).9 Three smaller 
trials yielded mixed results132–134 (see supplementary data online), 
which may be explained by differences in patient populations, CV 
risk, sample sizes, outcomes, or follow-up duration. Although the evi­
dence supporting the use of statins as cardioprotective treatment for 
anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is not unequivocal, this Focused 
Update supports the Class IIa recommendation introduced in the 
2022 ESC cardio-onocology Guidelines135 for statin treatment in pa­
tients at high or very high risk of developing cancer therapy-related 
CV toxicity (new recommendation in Recommendation Table 7). This 
was based on the net positive results of the largest of these trials 
(STOP-CA) and two meta-analyses of available randomized trials (in­
cluding unblinded trials),136,137 in combination with the overall safety 
of statins without reported increase in hepatotoxicity or myopathy in 
this setting.9,132–134
The effects of non-statin lipid-lowering therapies on LVEF or other 
cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving cancer therapy have 
not been tested.
10. Dietary supplements
The role of healthy dietary habits in lowering atherogenic lipid levels 
and reducing CV risk is discussed in detail in the 2019 ESC/EAS 
Guidelines.1 A healthy diet is generally defined as a dietary pattern 
low in saturated fat, with a focus on wholegrain products, vegetables, 
fruit, and fish.1 With respect to dietary supplements, however, there 
has not been compelling evidence that these can reduce CV risk. For 
red yeast rice preparations, although a clinically relevant hypocholes­
terolaemic effect has been reported with selected (purified, high- 
dose) preparations, convincing evidence of a clinical benefit resulting 
from this treatment is missing. Similarly, there has not been evidence 
that supplementation with PUFAs can lower LDL-C levels or reduce 
the risk of CV events—with the exception of high-dose, purified ico­
sapent ethyl used in the context of hypertriglyceridaemia. Along the 
same lines, the recently published OMEMI trial that tested PUFA 
(DHA + EPA) in elderly patients (age 70–82 years) without elevated 
triglycerides with recent (2–8 weeks) acute MI did not show a reduc­
tion in clinical events compared with placebo.11 The recent SPORT 
trial was a single-centre, randomized, single-blind study in persons 
without history of ASCVD and an increased 10 year risk of ASCVD. 
Participants (n = 199) were randomized to rosuvastatin 5 mg daily, 
placebo, fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast 
rice. At 28 days, LDL-C reduction (the study’s primary endpoint) was 
greater with rosuvastatin than with all supplements or placebo, and 
none of the dietary supplements led to a significant LDL-C reduction 
compared with placebo.10 Phytosterols reduce cholesterol absorp­
tion in the intestinal lumen and increase cholesterol excretion, and 
at doses of up to 2 grams per day they can reduce LDL-C levels by 
approximately 10% without reported adverse events. There are no 
studies showing benefit of phytosterols on CV outcomes.138 In June 
2022, the European Parliament and the Council prohibited the mar­
keting of food supplements containing ≥3 mg/day of monacolins 
from red yeast rice. Concretely, this corresponds to a ban on mona­
colins from red yeast rice at a daily dose of ≥3 mg/day, while lower 
doses of these supplements are under restrictions (warnings) and 
European Union scrutiny.139
Based on the totality of available evidence and in view of the new 
trials published after 2019,10,11 this Focused Update does not support 
the use of dietary supplements or vitamins without documented safety 
and significant LDL-C-lowering efficacy for lowering the risk of ASCVD 
(new recommendation in Recommendation Table 8).

Statin therapy is recommended for people in primary 
prevention aged ≥40 years with HIV, irrespective of 
estimated cardiovascular risk and LDL-C levels, to 
reduce the risk of cardiovascular events; the choice 
of statin should be based on potential drug 
interactions.7
