Diagnosing heart failure is often difficult due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, which can be caused by a range of medical conditions.
Natriuretic peptides (NPs) have been recognized as important biomarkers for diagnosing heart failure. This document from the Heart
Failure Association examines the practical uses of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in various clinical scenarios.
The concentrations of NT-proBNP vary according to the patient profile and the clinical scenario, therefore values should be interpreted
with caution to ensure appropriate diagnosis. Validated cut-points are provided to rule in or rule out acute heart failure in the emergency
department and to diagnose de novo heart failure in the outpatient setting. We also coin the concept of ‘heart stress’ when NT-proBNP
levels are elevated in an asymptomatic patient with risk factors for heart failure (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease),
underlying the development of cardiac dysfunction and further increased risk. We propose a simple acronym for healthcare professionals
and patients, FIND-HF, which serves as a prompt to consider heart failure: Fatigue, Increased water accumulation, Natriuretic peptide testing,
