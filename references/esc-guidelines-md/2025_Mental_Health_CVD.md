Disclaimer: This European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Clinical Consensus Statement was developed under the auspices of the ESC 
Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee and represents the views of the ESC and was produced after careful consideration of the scientific 
and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of its publication. The ESC is not responsible in the event of any 
contradiction, discrepancy and/or ambiguity between the ESC Guidelines and documents and any other official recommendations or 
guidelines issued by the relevant public health authorities, in particular in relation to good use of healthcare or therapeutic strategies. 
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Clinical Consensus Statement fully into account when exercising their clinical 
judgement, as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies; however, 
the ESC Clinical Consensus Statement does not override, in any way whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health professionals to 
make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient and, 
where appropriate and/or necessary, the patient’s caregiver. Nor does the ESC Clinical Consensus Statement exempt health 
professionals from taking into full and careful consideration the relevant official updated recommendations or guidelines issued by the 
competent public health authorities, in order to manage each patient’s case in light of the scientifically accepted data pursuant to their 
respective ethical and professional obligations. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the applicable rules and regulations 
relating to drugs and medical devices prior to making any clinical decision and to check whether a more recent version of this document 
exists. The ESC warns readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect.

1. Preamble
ESC Clinical Consensus Statements, developed under the auspices of 
the ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee, evaluate and summar­
ize available evidence with the aim of assisting health professionals in 
proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic approach for an individual 
patient with a given condition. ESC Clinical Consensus Statements are 
intended for use by health professionals but do not override their indi­
vidual responsibility to make appropriate and accurate decisions in con­
sideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with 
the patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or neces­
sary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules 
and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the 
time of prescription and to respect the ethical rules of their profession.
ESC Clinical Consensus Statements represent the official position of 
the ESC on a given topic. ESC Policies and Procedures for formulating 
and issuing ESC Guidelines and documents developed under the 
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                                 5

auspices of the ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee can be found 
on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical- 
Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines).
This Task Force was selected by the ESC to include professionals in­
volved with the medical care of patients with this pathology and to include 
patient representatives and methodologists. The selection procedure in­
cluded an open call for authors and aimed to include members from 
across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty 
Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion.
Clinical consensus statement Task Forces perform a critical review 
and evaluation of the published literature on diagnostic and therapeutic 
approaches including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Evidence ta­
bles summarizing key information from relevant studies are generated 
to facilitate the formulation of management consensus statements, to 
enhance their comprehension after publication, and to reinforce trans­
parency in the clinical consensus statement development process. The 
tables are published in their own section of the ESC Clinical Consensus 
Statement and reference specific recommendation tables.
After an iterative process of deliberations, a modified Delphi process 
on all management consensus statements was conducted. The Task 
Force members ranked their level of agreement or disagreement 
with each management consensus statement using the Likert ordinal 
scale: strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strong­
ly disagree, recuse. Consensus of agreement was inferred if >75% of 
the respondents selected the options ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’.
The writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest 
forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential 
sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest were re­
viewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules which can be 
found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/doi) and were 
compiled in a report published in a supplementary document with 
the Clinical Consensus Statement. Funding for the development of 
ESC Clinical Consensus Statements is derived entirely from the ESC 
with no involvement of the healthcare industry.
The CPG Committee supervises and co-ordinates the preparation 
of new clinical consensus statements and approves their publication. In add­
ition to review by the CPG Committee, ESC Clinical Consensus Statements 
undergo multiple rounds of double-blind peer review on a dedicated online 
review platform. The review is conducted by topic experts, including mem­
bers from ESC National Cardiac Societies and from relevant ESC 
Subspecialty Communities. Guideline Task Forces consider all review com­
ments and are required to respond to all those classified as major. After ap­
propriate revisions, Task Force and the CPG Committee members 
approve the final document for publication in the European Heart Journal.
Unless otherwise stated, ESC Clinical Consensus Statement content 
refers to sex, understood as the biological condition of being male or 
female, defined by genes, hormones, and sexual organs. Off-label use 
of medication may be presented in this Guideline if a sufficient level 
of evidence shows that it can be considered medically appropriate 
for a given condition. However, decisions on off-label use must be 
made by the responsible health professional giving special consideration 
to ethical rules concerning healthcare, the specific situation of the pa­
tient, patient consent, and country-specific health regulations.
2. The scope of this consensus 
statement
This consensus statement provides readers with insights into the extent 
and magnitude of the impact of mental health on cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and vice versa. It also outlines how the negative impacts of this 
reciprocal relationship can be prevented or minimized. Clinical cardio­
vascular (CV) practice often overlooks the impact of mental health and 
the importance of its inclusion in CV care; this needs to change. 
Therefore, this consensus statement sets out to be broad and ambi­
tious. The high burden of concomitant CVD and mental health condi­
tions requires a new integrated approach to caring for people with 
CVD. Cardiovascular health professionals need to develop collabora­
tions with mental health professionals to provide guidance for practice 
and appropriate support for people with CVD and their caregivers. 
Whilst challenging, healthcare professionals are encouraged to pursue 
the implementation of the suggestions in this statement, regardless of 
their profession, clinical setting, or resources. Changes in the current 
models of care, with structure and resource adjustments, may require 
both centre-specific and country-specific measures. Consequently, the 
document adopts a global perspective and reviews the evidence 
on the association between mental and CV health, as well as tackling 
key aspects such as awareness, communication, screening, optimal 
management, stigma, gaps in evidence, and needs for research. A com­
prehensive and inclusive perspective has also prompted the use of re­
spectful language in healthcare.1 People with lived experience of CVD 
and mental health conditions have been central in the creation of this 
document, and their perspectives underpin the importance of changing 
practice, and emphasize the need for implementation of the steps sug­
gested in this statement.
2.1. Methods employed in the consensus 
statement
This consensus document involved a multidisciplinary team of cardiol­
ogists, nurses, general professionals, psychologists, psychiatrists, geria­
tricians, and people with experience of mental health and CV 
conditions. It was developed under the auspices of the ESC Clinical 
Practice Guidelines Committee. The Task Force Chairs proposed the 
document structure; this was subsequently refined through group in­
put, with section leaders ensuring consistency, coherence, and clinical 
relevance. Literature reviews are comprehensively presented within 
evidence tables. Relevant, clinically tangible information is summarized 
within the text for the benefit of the clinical professional. Multiple meet­
ings were held to discuss the available evidence and the relative strength 
of that evidence.
On the basis of the evidence reviews and discussion, the Task Force 
identified that there is limited evidence to guide practice, despite the 
clear and important multidirectional interaction between mental health 
and CVD. As a result of the dearth of research, the Task Force adopted 
a modified Delphi process to generate main recommendations. The 
modified Delphi process is a structured communication technique 
that allows a group of experts to gather opinions on a given complex 
or controversial topic, for which there is insufficient evidence or incom­
plete knowledge.2 The modified Delphi questionnaire included manage­
ment consensus statements. These statements summarize factors from 
each section and typically consist of actions or practical suggestions that 
healthcare professionals should endeavor to implement in their prac­
tice. As these are based on limited evidence, the Task Force members 
ranked their level of agreement or disagreement with each manage­
ment consensus statement using the Likert ordinal scale: strongly agree, 
agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree, recuse. 
Consensus of agreement was inferred if >75% of the respondents se­
lected the options ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’. Consensus was reached 
for all the proposed management consensus statements following the

first round of voting. A total of 34 management consensus statements 
are presented in this document. Section summary points represent im­
portant components of the section that a healthcare professional 
should be aware of. They were also reviewed and revised by the 
Task Force, to ensure that they reflected the key elements of each sec­
tion. Section summary points and management consensus statements 
are presented at the end of each section.
3. Introduction
3.1. The relationship between mental and 
cardiovascular health and disease
Mental health is an integral component of a person’s health. According 
to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is a state of 
mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, 
realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their 
community.3 Despite its importance, there is not a single agreed defin­
ition for mental health.4
Although mental health and mental illness are sometimes considered 
as dual continua, for the purpose of this document, mental health is an 
overarching concept of a complex continuum spanning from optimal 
mental health with dominant features such as optimism, resilience, 
and well-being, to negative mental health states including severe mental 
illness (Figure 1).5 The nomenclature surrounding negative aspects and 
mental health disturbances also lacks consistent definitions. Mental 
health condition is a wide term that will be used in this document to 
refer to psychosocial difficulties and other mental states associated 
with distress, impairment in cognitive functioning, altered emotional re­
sponses, altered behaviour, and risk of self-harm. Within mental health 
conditions, mental health disorders refer to mental health states char­
acterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cogni­
tion, emotional regulation, or behaviour, usually associated with 
distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.3 Mental health 
disorders include severe mental illnesses (SMI) defined by a significantly 
impaired level of psychosocial functioning (Figure 1).6 In relation to the 
latter, we have drawn upon definitions and diagnostic criteria for men­
tal health conditions that are specified in the International Classification 
of Diseases for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics, Eleventh Revision.7
Organic mental health disorders, such as cognitive impairment and de­
mentia, are outside the scope of this document.
This consensus statement will address mental health conditions 
across the spectrum of severity and type, as both people with symp­
toms of suboptimal mental health identified through screening, and 
people with manifest mental health disorders, are at high CVD risk. 
Core principles, across the spectrum of disease, are outlined. To illus­
trate the impact and implementation of some of the key aspects of the 
document, the narratives of people living with CVD and clinical cases 
have been incorporated into the online document ‘Clinical cases and 
patient perspectives’.

Mental health and mental health conditions interact with CV health 
(defined as the health of the heart and blood vessels)8 and CVD in a 
multidirectional way (Figure 2). For example: 
• Positive features of mental health at an individual and societal level are 
associated with better CV health,9–11 while people with mental 
health conditions are more likely to be at greater risk of CVD.12
• Acute CV events or chronic CVD impact on mental health, worsen­
ing pre-existing mental conditions or triggering new conditions.13–16
• The concurrence of CVD and mental health conditions may interact, 
worsening both mental health and CV prognosis.17–19
• People with mental health conditions are often the most disadvan­
taged, experiencing social and economic hardship as well as dealing 
with stigma, stereotypes, and prejudice.20
• People with mental health disorders, particularly SMI, are more 
vulnerable, and are less likely to receive the same diagnostic 
and treatment efforts as persons without mental health condi­
tions.21–26

3.2. Enduring problems
Despite the strong association between mental health, CV health, and 
CVD, and its clinical relevance, there are multiple problems (Figure 2) 
including: 
• Insufficient awareness among healthcare professionals of the preva­
lence of mental health conditions in the population and their impact 
on increasing risk of developing CVD.27
• Limited appreciation among healthcare professionals of the incidence 
and prevalence of mental health conditions and mental disorders 
among people with CVD and their impact on quality of life (QoL), 
therapeutic adherence, and CVD prognosis.27
• Inadequate recognition of the stigma of SMI in society and in health­
care, and its consequences for people coping with SMI, their family, 
and caregivers.28
• Lack of systematic and appropriate screening, evaluation, communi­
cation, and management of mental health, which are not integrated in 
routine clinical CV practice.29
• Little knowledge and ongoing research about how to improve CV 
health and prevent CVD in people with mental health conditions 
and mental disorders.21–23,27
• Limited evidence and ongoing research on the best ways to commu­
nicate, promote, maintain, and improve mental health and resilience 
in people with CVD and their family members.30
• Little guidance about how to improve the care of people with SMI, 
despite strong evidence that people with SMI and CVD have worse 
CV prevention, acute and chronic care, and prognosis.21,24–26
• Limited awareness of the importance of family and caregivers and 
their needs, as both CVD and mental health conditions affect a per­
son’s wider social network.31–34
Cardiovascular care is optimal when it is person-centred and seeks 
to improve overall health, not only CV but also mental health, as an in­
tegral component. This approach needs to be integrated into routine 
practice as most current models of CV care do not consider mental 
health as a primary goal. To achieve this, healthcare professionals 
need more comprehensive information about mental health and how 
to deliver mental health sensitive, person-centred care. Furthermore, 
the mental health challenges experienced by family members and care­
givers are often not recognized nor addressed.35 Central to this state­
ment is the recognition that CV care professionals need to develop 
collaboration with mental health professionals in order to ensure opti­
mal care and outcomes. Access to mental health services may vary, but 
the multidisciplinary CV team needs to include a collaborating mental 
health professional, psychologist, or psychiatrist to provide guidance 
for practice and appropriate support for people with CVD and their 
caregivers. In this consensus statement, we have called this the 
Psycho-Cardio team (Figure 3).

3.3. Aims of the document
This document adopts a broad, summarizing approach, and provides 
key and consensus statements which collectively: 
• Critically review the evidence on the association between mental and 
CV health.
• Increase awareness of the clinical importance of the association be­
tween mental and CV health.
• Increase awareness and combat the stigma of mental health condi­
tions and mental health disorders.
• Promote increased mental health screening and better management 
for people with CVD and mental health conditions and support for 
caregivers.
• Provide guidance on initial clinical, systemic, and organizational 
changes needed, as well as signposting future directions.
• Identify gaps in evidence and research needed to improve the care for 
people with mental health conditions and CVD.
3.4. The Psycho-Cardio team
Multidisciplinary teams are needed to offer a holistic approach to health 
promotion and management in people with CVD and mental health 
conditions. In addition to CV and mental health professionals, the 
Psycho-Cardio team should be augmented by allied professionals, as ap­
propriate.36 Care continuity should be ensured via co-ordination with 
the multidisciplinary primary care team, and psychosocial determinants 
and potential social interventions discussed with social workers and 
relevant professionals. All professionals should advocate for improved 
mental health and CV care; those with advocacy responsibilities within 
the public health and policy domain should ensure changes recom­
mended here are priorities. A practical approach to change routine clin­
ical CV care towards being more person-centred is to focus on 
awareness toward the person with CVD and caregivers’ mental health, 
CV prevention, and care of people with mental health conditions fol­
lowing the ACTIVE principles (Figure 4). 
• First, acknowledge (A) the intricate relationship between mental 
health, CV health, and CVD, their common and specific determi­
nants, and the influence that mental health conditions may have on 
prognosis and care equity. Particular attention is required to identify 
and eliminate potential bias, disparities and stigma associated with 
mental health conditions and disorders, particularly in those with SMI.
• Second, check (C) systematically for the presence of symptoms of 
mental health conditions or mental health disorders at CV visits, 
and check CV risk factors during mental health visits.
• Third, use validated tools (T) to assess mental and CV health 
status among people with CVD, and use tools to inform and 
educate about the importance of mental and CV health, and their 
relationships.

• Fourth, implement (I) person-centred practices in CV care using 
evidence-based, stepped care approaches. These should be individua­
lized to the person and their circumstances and recognize the im­
portance of caregivers and caregivers’ health status.
• Fifth, venture (V) to convince professionals, managers, and people liv­
ing with CVD, to obtain their collaboration, support, and resources 
to make the needed structural and functional changes to face this 
challenge. These will not occur spontaneously. Professionals and in­
stitutions willing to improve CV and mental healthcare through col­
laborative, person-centred models, with compassionate support for 
families and caregivers will undoubtedly face several barriers when 
implementing change.
• Sixth, evaluate (E) the current status of routine CV care in each set­
ting and estimate the needs for organizational, educational, and clin­
ical support to implement the required changes. Progress in 
management and mental health outcomes will also have to be evalu­
ated for quality assurance and improvement purposes.

management consensus statements from 
Section 3
4. Impact of mental health on the 
risk of developing cardiovascular 
disease
This section focuses on the relationship between mental health and CV 
risk in individuals without known CVD. The aim is to elucidate for the 
healthcare professional the aetiological impact of psychosocial stress 
factors on the onset of CVD. The evidence, which includes large 
population-based studies and meta-analyses that adjust or control for 
concurrent somatic risk factors, is robust. Such evidence underscores 
the independent impact of psychosocial risk factors on the prediction 
of hard endpoints including all-cause mortality, and major adverse car­
diac events (MACE).
4.1. Positive mental health states as 
predictors of better cardiovascular health
Subjective well-being (SWB) is an overarching term that covers dif­
ferent aspects of positive mental affect states.3 An individual with 
SWB is satisfied with life, has a sense of purpose, and possesses 
meaning in life.37 Related features to positive affectivity encompass 
psychological well-being, high life satisfaction, joy, optimism, and 
happiness.38 Sexual health is also an important component of mental 
well-being and can be impaired both as a cause or as a consequence 
of mental and CV issues.39 Positive trait-like dispositions like sense 
of coherence, a person’s view of life, and capacity to respond to 
stressful situations,40 and other more psychobiological-driven per­
sonality factors (i.e. emotional vitality, vigour, positive energy, and 
resilience) are further linked concepts employed in population- 
based studies.
Subjective well-being and related features have been advocated as 
protective states against premature mortality and morbidity, mainly fo­
cusing on CVD conditions. Systematic review and meta-analytic evi­
dence have shown favourable effects on mortality.41,42 In the largest 
meta-analysis, the survival impact of SWB was significant in both men 
and women, however, more protective in men.42 Positive affect was as­
sociated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD),43 and op­
timism with a lower incidence of heart failure (HF).44 Consecutive 
studies have demonstrated the importance of sexual well-being in over­
all well-being in CVD.39 Lastly, negative affect, a component of SWB, 
has also been shown to increase incident CVD events, even after con­
trolling for known confounders.45
Mechanistically, SWB may have stress-buffering properties that di­
minish physiological hyper-responsiveness46 or exert protective CV ef­
fects via a more balanced physiology (i.e. autonomic regulation, 
enhanced neuroendocrine functioning, reduced inflammation).47
Alternatively, SWB may result in greater engagement in healthy beha­
viours,48 that in turn drive better social functioning, personal relation­
ships, and QoL.49
4.2. Psychosocial stress
Psychosocial stress arises when an individual perceives and responds to 
a social demand (family issues, social isolation, financial pressures, and 
work) that exceeds an individual’s adaptive capacity or regulatory 
homeostatic range to cope.50,51 The same situation can be stressful 
for one person but not for another, due to psychological appraisal pro­
cesses that typically operate outside of conscious awareness.52 In most 
cases, psychosocial stress results in an appropriate state of arousal 
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
Mental health and mental health conditions interact with CV health 
and CVD in a multidirectional way.
(ii)
The coexistence of CVD and mental health conditions can create a 
mutual interaction that worsens both mental and CV health, 
leading to poorer outcomes.
(iii)
Routine CV clinical practice lacks integrated, systematic and 
appropriate screening, evaluation, communication, and 
management of mental health.
(iv)
There is limited evidence on the best ways to communicate, 
promote, maintain, and improve mental health and resilience in 
people with CVD and their family members.
(v)
The evidence base to guide practice in relation to the screening and 
management of mental health conditions in people with CVD is 
limited.
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Cardiovascular care is optimal if it is person-centred and seeks to 
improve overall health, not only CV but also mental health, as an 
integral component.
(ii)
A multidisciplinary team including mental health professionals, 
psychologists, and/or psychiatrists (Psycho-Cardio team) is needed 
in CV care to provide guidance for practice and appropriate mental 
health assessment, support, and management to people with CVD 
and their caregivers.
(iii)
Cardiovascular services should aspire to implement a Psycho-Cardio 
team approach, tailored to the local population, context, and 
resources.
(iv)
Implementing the ACTIVE principles is a practical approach to 
transform routine clinical CV care towards being more 
person-centred, integrating mental healthcare into routine CV 
practice to improve care.

and hyper-mobilization53 that is contextually applicable.52 However, 
clinically more important are long-term sustained stress conditions 
(chronic stress) which cause exacerbated pathophysiological changes 
in the heart and vasculature. Various psychosocial risk factors are de­
scribed below and illustrated in Figure 5.
Psychosocial factors as a whole are as potent risk factors as conven­
tional risk factors, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.51 [95% con­
fidence interval (CI) 2.15–2.93].54 Chronic psychological stress is 
associated with an increased risk of CVD.55 People experiencing their 
first myocardial infarction (MI) reported higher prevalence of stress 
(work home, financial, major life events) in the 12 months prior to ad­
mission; the highest risk was for permanent stress at work (OR 2.14; 
99% CI 1.73–2.64). The increased risk is consistent across regions, 
ethnic groups, men, and women.56 Stress can trigger CVD events 
through: (i) changes in autonomic balance, (ii) alteration of neuroen­
docrine axes, (iii) activation of inflammatory systems, and (iv) engage­
ment in health-damaging behaviours like smoking and alcohol 
consumption.57 The latter typically cluster significantly with stress ex­
posure.57 Management of psychosocial stress and promotion of men­
tal well-being should therefore be integral parts of comprehensive CV 
healthcare and prevention.
4.3. Work stress and unemployment
Most individuals spend a major portion of their active lives in work envir­
onments, which can be a source of psychosocial stress. A large-scale 
meta-analysis demonstrated that work stress/job strain was significantly as­
sociated with a higher risk for CHD.58 In equally large prospective cohort 
studies, job strain was associated with shorter chronic disease-free life ex­
pectancy,59 and loss of chronic disease-free life expectancy.60 Workplace 
bullying at baseline increased risk of CHD or stroke by 59% and by 25% 
over more than 12 years of follow-up in those who reported physical vio­
lence or threat of violence at work after adjustment for confounders.61
Reduced life expectancy is likely driven through increased CVD risk 
factors. Strong evidence links work stress to increased risk of hyperten­
sion,62 insomnia,63 and negative affectivity.64 Further, effects can be cu­
mulative.65 Maladaptive compensatory behaviour patterns (smoking,66
physical inactivity,67 self-damaging alcohol consumption, and other un­
healthy lifestyle patterns)68 also drive work-related stress burdens that 
can result in CVD.69 Unemployed persons have equally high prevalences 
of unhealthy lifestyles, biological CV risk factors, and CVD.70–73 Work 
stress is therefore an important mediator of CVD risk and outcome. If 
people with CVD voice concern about work stress, they should be 
appropriately counselled as suggested in Section 5.

4.4. Socioeconomic and subjective social 
status
Low socioeconomic status (SES) is an independent risk factor for 
CVD.74 Subjective social status (SSS), which refers to the ‘individual’s 
perception of his or her own position in the social hierarchy’,75 is 
also an important mediator of CVD risk. Risk appears to be mediated 
through lifestyle pathways, however, it is increased via delayed or poor 
CVD management.76 Whilst healthcare professionals may be limited in 
their ability to address these factors, there remains a need to advocate 
for social policies to address inequalities in SES for those with such a 
remit.
4.5. Perceived discrimination
Lifetime discrimination (experiences of unfair treatment in various life 
domains) and everyday discrimination (frequency of day-to-day occur­
rences of perceived unfair treatment), and related features like social 
stigmatization, have been linked to CVD.77 Multiple studies have de­
monstrated that lifetime discrimination increases CVD risk or all-cause 
mortality even after adjustment for important confounders.77–80 The 
strength of the evidence suggests that discrimination is important, 
thus people describing discrimination in the clinical setting should be ap­
propriately counselled in terms of prevention of health hazards.
4.6. Mental stress through impaired social 
relationships
There are multiple avenues through which mental stress can drive CVD 
risk and prognosis. Important categories of mental stress are summar­
ized below.
4.6.1. Adverse childhood experiences
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are broadly defined as ‘child­
hood events, varying in severity and often chronic, occurring in a child’s 
family or social environment that cause harm or distress, thereby dis­
rupting the child’s physical or psychological health and development’.81
These events include physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, neglect, care­
giver mental illness, and domestic violence.81 Several studies comparing 
adults with and without ACEs exposure have shown higher incidence of 
CVD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression, and all-cause mortality.82–86
Healthcare professionals must be aware of the relationship between 
ACEs and CVD, and if described during clinical interview they should 
raise awareness to the potential health ramifications and refer these in­
dividuals to the appropriate preventative services.
4.6.2. Partnership violence
Intimate partner violence is associated with a greater prevalence of 
mental health conditions,87 and appears to be an additional stressor 
that directly and indirectly impacts women’s CV health. However, 
the findings across studies are inconsistent.88 Although the evidence 
is more limited in males, experiences of intimate partner violence, 
whether as victim or perpetrator, have been linked to increased 
CVD risk.89
4.6.3. Loneliness and social isolation
Loneliness is defined as a ‘subjective negative experience that results 
from inadequate meaningful connections, where “inadequate” refers 
to the discrepancy or unmet need between an individual’s preferred 
and actual experience’.90 Social isolation whilst conceptually similar 
is defined as ‘an objective “lack” or “absence” of social contact or 
relationships’.91 Evidence from meta-analyses and population-based 
cohort studies have determined that both loneliness and social 
isolation are associated with increased CVD risk.92,93 Healthcare 
professionals should be aware of the potential impact these experi­
ences have on CVD risk. Social prescribing may be a potential inter­
vention to improve social isolation and loneliness as discussed in 
Section 5.
4.7. Mental health conditions and 
personality traits as risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease
4.7.1. Depression
The WHO defines depressive disorder as a common mental condition 
that involves a low mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for 
long periods of time.94 Common symptoms are feelings of sadness, 
emptiness, hopelessness, having trouble concentrating, losing interest 
in things that one used to enjoy, feeling worthless, guilt, and experien­
cing disrupted sleep.94 Depressive mood is a normal reaction to severe 
adverse life events and problems (i.e. divorce, job loss). Diagnostic cri­
teria for depressive disorders are shown in Supplementary data online, 
Table S1. The prevalence of depression is estimated to be 4.4% in the 
general population (in total, 322 million globally) posing a significant 
public health challenge.94 Depression has been shown to be as strong 
a CV risk factor as traditional somatic risk factors.95,96 Large observa­
tional and case-control studies demonstrate that depression is inde­
pendently associated with incident CVD, all-cause mortality, and 
combined CVD/mortality outcome, with hazard ratios (HRs) or ORs 
ranging from 1.14 to 1.55.56,97 Meta-analyses have shown depression 
to confer increased risk for incident HF, new-onset and recurring atrial 
fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, and sudden cardiac 
death (SCD).98–101
4.7.2. Anxiety
Anxiety is an emotion characterized by worrying that may be accom­
panied by non-specific physical and psychological symptoms such as 
restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, 
or sleep disturbances.102 If it is intense and sudden, anxiety may present 
as a panic attack, with palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest 
pain, lightheadedness, or a dying sensation lasting several minutes.103
Fear and anxiety are closely related phenomena, but differ in terms 
of their orientation in time. Anxiety is ‘future-oriented’ (i.e. perceived/ 
anticipated threats), whilst fear is a reaction to a perceived imminent 
threat in the present.104
Anxiety or fear-related disorders are characterized by excessive fear 
and anxiety that cause distress or impairment in functioning. These dis­
orders include generalized anxiety, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific 
phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety, selective mutism, 
and other related disorders. Multiple studies and meta-analyses have 
shown that anxiety and anxiety disorders (together or individually) 
are associated with increased risk of CVD and/or CV mortality.105–109
The relationship between anxiety and arrhythmias or HF is less clear 
with mixed findings.100,109–111 Panic disorders and panic attacks have 
also been associated with incident CVD events.112 Overall, evidence 
suggests that the link between anxiety or fear and CVD risk is suffi­
cient that healthcare professionals should be aware of the relationship

4.7.3. Post-traumatic stress disorder
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex and debilitating 
condition, often stemming from exposure to traumatic events that 
shatter a person’s sense of safety and security.113 Symptoms encom­
pass intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares, and heightened arousal, 
all of which can severely impair an individual’s QoL.114 Onset of PTSD 
can occur at any time during the lifespan following exposure to a trau­
matic event.
Post-traumatic stress disorder is an important risk factor for 
CVD, both in terms of its development and progression. PTSD 
among Armed Forces veterans has been linked to a 25%–50% 
higher risk of CVD, including HF, MI, and CVD mortality com­
pared with those without PTSD, even after adjustment for de­
pression and other factors.115–117 The mechanisms by which 
PTSD may increase CV risk are not fully understood. However, 
it has been shown that PTSD elicits psychological, physiological, 
and behavioural responses that lead to increased risk.118
Autonomic imbalance (increased activity of the sympathetic ner­
vous system and decreased activity of the parasympathetic ner­
vous system), damaged baroreflex function, and subsequent 
blood pressure dysregulation may also play a role.119 PTSD is 
also associated with elevated markers of inflammation,120 and of­
ten associated with unhealthy diet and lifestyle, obesity, sleep dis­
turbance, decreased physical activity, medication non-adherence, 
substance abuse, smoking, and alcohol abuse, all of which contrib­
ute to poor CV health.121–123 Definition and characteristics of 
PTSD can be found in Supplementary data online, Table S3. 
Symptoms and suggested key questions to identify depression, 
anxiety, or PTSD can be found in Supplementary data online,

from Section 4
5. Mental health and mental health 
conditions in people with 
cardiovascular disease
The previous section focused on the analysis of CV risk associated with 
mental health conditions in individuals without CVD. This section ad­
dresses the prevalence of mental health conditions among people 
with CVD, their impact on CV prognosis, self-management and adher­
ence to medical recommendations, as well as the impact of CVD on the 
mental health of family members or caregivers.
5.1. Impact of cardiovascular disease on 
mental health
Cardiovascular disease can induce significant mental health conditions. 
The perceived characteristics of acute CV events, such as acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS) or arrhythmia, coupled with the threat of death and 
helplessness,124,125 may trigger intense negative emotional responses.126
Even when diagnostic criteria for mental health disorders are not met, 
people with CVD may experience existential concerns. These include 
fear of recurrence, apprehension about death, emotional and work- 
related stress, anger, grief, and worries about the well-being of family 
members.127,128 The need for complex treatment regimens and lifestyle 
changes negatively impacts QoL and general well-being, and may be dif­
ficult to initiate and maintain.129 Combined with the perceived loss of 
health and independence, these factors may contribute to an increased 
risk of developing mental health conditions in people with CVD.
In some instances, these reactions and symptoms might become 
severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of a mental health disorder, 
such as depression, anxiety, and even cardiac disease-induced PTSD 
(CDI-PTSD).13,125,126 The prevalence of mental health conditions in 
people with CVD varies widely based on type of CVD, individual char­
acteristics, life contexts, and assessment tools. Most importantly, these 
comorbid mental health conditions might impact self-management, 
adherence to medication prescriptions, diet, physical activity, and smok­
ing cessation plans, overall outcomes, and even prognosis in people 
with CVD.125,126 This association is particularly evident with stress 
and depression, where 1 year healthcare costs for society are 33% 
higher compared with those with CVD.130 Therefore, it is imperative 
to inform and educate CV care professionals about the mental 
health-related consequences of CVD.
5.2. Specific mental health conditions in 
people with cardiovascular disease: 
prevalence and prognostic impact
5.2.1. Depressive symptoms and depression
It is important to differentiate depressive symptoms from depression as 
the term ‘depression’ encompasses various meanings, spanning from 
temporary feelings of low mood to severe clinical conditions that are dis­
abling, recurrent, and severe. Moreover, some individuals exhibit a per­
sistently distressed personality with certain depressive traits. People 
coping with CVD may experience any of these distinct clusters of symp­
toms, however, the most prevalent type of depression observed follow­
ing ACS is an ‘adjustment disorder with depressed mood’.131 People 
meeting the criteria for major depressive disorder are at elevated risk 
for subsequent events and often experience significantly diminished 
QoL. Consequently, these individuals require focused efforts for identi­
fication, precise diagnosis, and dedicated management.132
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
Indicators of positive mental health, such as optimism, 
happiness, and high life satisfaction are associated with lower 
CV risk.
(ii)
Hazardous psychosocial factors (e.g. social isolation, financial 
pressures, and work) are associated with increased risk of 
developing CVD.
(iii)
Mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD are 
associated with an increased risk of developing CVD.
(iv)
Healthcare professionals have a responsibility to: 
• Be informed of these associations.
• Be alert to these risk factors during consultation.
• Inform, counsel, and refer individuals at risk as needed.
• Advocate for system changes as appropriate.
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Management of psychosocial stress and promotion of mental 
well-being are essential components of integrated CV 
prevention.
(ii)
Screening for depression, anxiety, and PTSD is advised to be 
integrated into CV risk assessment.

5.2.1.1. Prevalence of depressive symptoms and depression in 
people with cardiovascular disease
Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions in 
people with CVD. The global prevalence of depression among people 
with CVD, as measured by various self-report questionnaires, is esti­
mated to be 18%.14 It is more common among women and in older 
ages, yet healthy and physically functioning older adults are at lower 
risk of depression compared with young adults.14,133,134 Depression 
is associated with several negative lifestyle factors, such as smoking, al­
cohol intake, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet, as well as other 
CVD risk factors including diabetes and hypertension.135 These poten­
tially modifiable risk factors are all associated with coronary artery dis­
ease (CAD), MI, HF, stroke, and mortality.54 Table 1 presents examples 
of studies demonstrating how rates of depression vary based on the 
condition, diagnostic methods, and population demographics.
5.2.1.2. Impact of depressive symptoms and depression on 
cardiovascular disease prognosis
Depression is a known risk factor for poor prognosis among people 
with CVD. While one study did not find a significant impact of 
depression on CV or all-cause mortality after MI,156 more recent stud­
ies suggest otherwise. For example, post-MI depression, though attenu­
ated by severity, independently predicts a 22% higher all-cause 
mortality and 13% more CV events per standard deviation increase 
in depression z-score.157 Depression has been associated with an in­
creased risk of non-fatal CV events, as well as all-cause mortality after 
ACS.17 Even 10 years after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
(∼50% elective), depression was associated with an increased risk for 
all-cause mortality.158 Depression is also a marker of poor prognosis 
in people with HF, where both depressive symptoms and depressive 
disorders have been prospectively linked to frequent hospitalizations, 
recurrent CV events, and mortality.18 The prospective associations be­
tween elevated depressive symptoms or a depressive disorder and HF 
was associated with a two-fold increased risk of death or CV events.15
Depression at the start of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ECR) 
was significantly associated with lower improvement in exercise capacity 
and QoL during rehabilitation.129 Depression and previous suicide at­
tempts detected before or after heart transplantation (HTx) may impact 
long-term HTx outcomes (rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and 
death),159 probably related to increased non-adherence to medications.160
Table 1 Prevalence of depression/depressive symptoms in people with cardiovascular disease
CVD
Prevalence data
ACS/Post-MI
Depressive symptoms were reported by 31% of individuals following MI.136
The prevalence of depression at the time of hospitalization was 40% in women under 60 years, compared with 22% in 
men of the same age group. Among those over 60 years, the prevalence was 21% in women and 15% in men.137
In 8580 people with ACS from 22 European countries who were ≥6 months post-hospitalization,a depressive 
symptoms were more frequent in women (32.3%) than men (21.2%), with moderate/severe depression in 12.7% of 
women and 7.4% of men.138
Chronic HF
Clinically significant depression affected 21.5% of people with HF, ranging from 33.6% via questionnaires to 19.3% via 
interviews, and 11% in NYHA class I to 42% in NYHA class IV.15
Depression was more common in women with chronic HF (32.7% vs 26.1%), with rates of 11%–67% in women and 
7%–63% in men, and increased with higher NYHA functional class.15
Advanced HF and 
post-transplantation
Depression affects 25%–35% of individuals after HTx.139–141
Depression was reported in 35% of individuals pre-transplant and 26.3% post-transplant.140
Depression occurs in 15%–39% of people with ventricular assist devices, often exceeding clinical cut-offs, particularly in 
older people.114,142
People experiencing HTx had less depression than those with mechanical assist devices.143
AF
38% of people with AF met Beck Depression Inventory criteria for significant depression.144
ICD
Random-effects meta-analyses showed clinically relevant depression in 15.4% (95% CI 11.9%–18.9%) of people with an 
ICD at all timepoints post-insertion.145
The 2 year incidence of new-onset depression after ICD implantation was 11.3% in a national ICD registry.146
Depressive symptoms affected 20% of people with ICDs (12% mild, 6% moderate, 2% severe). Moderate to severe 
depression was more common in secondary prophylactic indications and in people experiencing ≥5 ICD shocks.147
People with ICDs and pacemakers had similarly increased levels of depression.148
ACHD
Individuals with ACHD have higher depression rates than the general population, with a weighted prevalence of 24% vs 15%.149
People with ACHD had a low and comparable suicide risk to the reference cohort.150
PH/PAH
In 2161 people with PH, the reported pooled prevalence of depression was 28% (95% CI 20.5–36.8).134
Smaller studies report depression prevalence in people with PAH ranging from 9% to 70%, linked to disease 
severity.151–155

Depression is also related to increased adverse events in people with 
ventricular assist devices (VAD),161,162 and is a factor for negative out­
comes among people coping with AF. In a meta-analysis consisting of 
seven cohort studies with 1070 AF people who underwent catheter ab­
lation, depression before the procedure was independently associated 
with an increased risk of AF recurrence after ablation.163 Further, symp­
toms of depression were the strongest independent predictor of future 
QoL post-ablation.144
5.2.1.3. Impact of depressive symptoms/depression on 
self-management and adherence
One possible path by which depression is associated with adverse out­
comes among people with CVD is limited engagement in self-care prac­
tices and lack of adherence, as depression is associated with challenges in 
self-management of CV medication, healthy lifestyle, ECR, and self- 
care.129,164–166 Kronish et al. reported that people with persistent de­
pression were only half as likely to enrol in an ECR programme com­
pared with those without persistent depression.167 People with 
persistent depression also showed lower rates of adherence to smoking 
cessation, taking medications, and exercising. A recent daily diary study 
demonstrated that on days when people attending ECR experienced ele­
vated depression symptoms, they engaged in less physical activity and 
more sedentary behaviour.168 In a cohort study of individuals who under­
went PCI (n = 124 443), participants with depression were 10% to 20% 
less likely to attain optimal adherence to Guideline-recommended med­
ications compared with those without depression.169 Finally, a systematic 
review of quantitative studies indicated that even mild to moderate levels 
of depression were significantly associated with medication adherence in 
people with HF.170
5.2.2. Anxiety
5.2.2.1. Prevalence of anxiety in people with cardiovascular disease
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found prevalence of anx­
iety among people with CVD to range from 28.9% to 32.9%.16,171
Higher rates are found using questionnaires (34.8% to 9%) compared 
with clinical diagnostic interviews (17%). The highest rates of anxiety 
disorder based on diagnostic interviews were reported in people with 
undifferentiated chest pain or palpitations (19%). Anxiety tended to 
be more prevalent among females compared with males (43% vs 
29.5%).171 As with depression, prevalence of anxiety varies by CV 
condition, method of diagnosis, and population demographics. 
Table 2 presents examples of studies demonstrating how rates of anx­
iety vary based on the condition, diagnostic methods, and population 
demographics.
5.2.2.2. Impact of anxiety on cardiovascular disease prognosis
A meta-analysis estimating the effect of anxiety on CV outcomes in 
more than 30 000 people with CAD found that the impact depends 
on the timing, with no effect of anxiety in the first 2 months after 
ACS but with a negative effect on outcome in people with stable 
CAD.19 Generalized anxiety disorder, present in 5.5% of people 3 
months after acute MI (AMI), was associated with a two-fold increased 
risk of adverse outcomes (CV events and all-cause mortality) during a 
10 year follow-up period.184 There is little effect of anxiety symptoms 
alone on outcome in HF although comorbid anxiety and depression 
increase the risk for rehospitalization and mortality in people with 
HF.185–187 Among people with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator 
(ICD), anxiety was a strong predictor of mortality with an OR of 4.17 in 
a cross-sectional national survey in Denmark.188
5.2.2.3. Impact of anxiety on self-management and adherence
Interestingly, anxiety, as opposed to depression, may encourage people 
to be adherent (e.g. to their medication regimen) and can have a posi­
tive impact on clinical outcome in people with CVD.189,190 However, 
anxiety disorders are mostly linked with unhealthy lifestyle, poor adher­
ence to lifestyle modification, and lower participation in ECR.138 One 
possible explanation of this trend is people with anxiety have a ten­
dency to avoid reminders of the illness.191
5.2.3. Cardiac disease-induced post-traumatic stress 
disorder/symptoms
5.2.3.1. Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in 
cardiovascular disease
Cardiac disease-induced PTSD, or post-traumatic stress symptoms 
(PTSS) defined as post-traumatic symptoms to full disorder emerging 
from an acute CV event or intervention, has a heterogeneous incidence 
among different types of CVD. Table 3 presents examples of studies 
demonstrating how rates of PTSD and PTSS vary based on the condi­
tion, diagnostic methods, and population demographics.
5.2.3.2. Impact of post-traumatic stress disorder on cardiovascular 
disease prognosis
Cardiac disease-induced PTSS are linked to numerous adverse physical 
and emotional outcomes, including increased overall psychopathology 
and heightened mortality risk. However, due to the predominantly 
cross-sectional or retrospective nature of existing studies, distinguish­
ing the effects of CDI-PTSS from those of the triggering event remains 
challenging. Nevertheless, the association between CDI-PTSS and ele­
vated rates of mortality and CV events underscores the need for fur­
ther research.13
Studies examining the implications of CDI-PTSS on subsequent 
MACE or all-cause mortality yielded mixed results. The severity of in­
trusion symptoms (intrusive thoughts or images related to the traumat­
ic event, nightmares, and flashbacks) measured 1 month after a first MI 
predicted recurrent MACE/all-cause mortality 42 months later.198
People scoring >11 on the intrusions dimension of the Impact of 
Event Scale (IES)199 had a three times higher risk of developing 
MACE and all-cause mortality than did those classified as low on this 
symptom cluster.198 Similarly, dissociative symptoms during hospitaliza­
tion predict 15 year all-cause mortality among people with MI,200 and 
people with above-threshold PTSD-related symptoms at 6 months 
post-event had a 42%–50% prevalence of experiencing other serious 
CV events during the next 6 months compared with a 26%–32% preva­
lence of the same among people without PTSS.201 Other studies found 
that PTSD measured 4 to 6 weeks post-MI was not predictive of MACE 
9 months later.202
Cardiac disease-induced PTSS predict non-fatal CVD-related hospital 
readmissions 1 to 4 years after a previous index MI.203 Increasing levels of 
CDI-PTSS, measured by the IES and PTSD Symptom Scale,204 are asso­
ciated with CV readmissions.205 Further, people with IES-reported PTSS


<!-- PAGE 17 -->

### Page 17

are more than twice as likely as those without PTSS to be readmitted 
during the year following their MI.206 However, other studies showed 
that PTSD measured by the Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale may not 
be associated with frequency of CVD-related hospital readmissions.207
5.2.3.3. Impact of post-traumatic stress disorder on 
self-management and adherence to medical recommendations
Evidence on CDI-PTSD and non-adherence is mixed, with some studies 
showing positive associations and others not.201,206,208–210 However, 
stronger evidence links CDI-PTSD to non-adherence to medication 
and physical activity.
5.2.4. Loneliness and living conditions
In a cross-sectional study of hospitalized people with various types of 
CVD, loneliness measured at discharge was associated with significantly 
worse outcomes in men and women.211 Moreover, loneliness pre­
dicted all-cause mortality risk, which was almost three-fold among wo­
men and two-fold among men. Living alone predicted CV event risk in 
men only (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.05–1.85).211 In a prospective randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) in people with stable CHD, living alone was re­
lated to a higher risk of CV death and the primary composite endpoint 
of non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Being married, as compared with 
being widowed, was associated with a lower risk of CV death and 
the primary composite endpoint.212
Table 2 Prevalence of anxiety/anxiety symptoms in people with cardiovascular disease
CVD
Prevalence data
ACS/Post-MI
In an international cohort of people with CABG, PCI, post-MI, and ACS ≥6 months post-hospitalization, anxiety prevalence 
ranged from 12% to 42% in men and 22% to 64% in women, with moderate to severe anxietya in 11% of men and 23% of 
women.138
At 3 months post-MI, 10% reported high anxiety, dropping to reference population levelsb at 3–18 months.172
In people diagnosed with SCAD, 41% had mild anxiety and 16% moderate to severe anxiety by questionnaire. Higher anxiety 
scores were more common in women, younger individuals, those with lower resilience, and those closer to the event.173
Chronic HF
Up to 72% of people with HF experience anxiety, with pooled estimates of 56% for symptoms, 29% for clinically significant 
anxiety, and 13.1% for anxiety disorders. Prevalence was higher in studies with more female participants.174
People with HF face a higher risk of anxiety, with 23% experiencing symptoms and 32% having both anxiety and 
depression.175
Advanced HF and 
post-transplantation
The pooled prevalence of anxiety among people experiencing HTx was 11% (95% CI 3.8%–28.5%).176
AF
People with AF exhibited a 28% prevalence of anxiety at baseline, comparable to controls, with symptoms persisting in 37% 
after 6 months.144
Among people undergoing cardioversion or ablation, 30% reported clinically significant anxiety.177
ICD
Among OHCA survivors, anxiety was reported in 36% of women vs 20% of men, with higher rates in younger women 
(<55 years) than older women (43% vs 28%).178
At 18 months post-OHCA, 32% showed anxiety symptoms.179
A large-scale registry reported 20% anxiety among people experiencing OHCA.180
Random-effects meta-analysis found clinically relevant anxiety in 23% (95% CI 18.3%–27.0%) of people with an ICD at all 
timepoints post-insertion.145
New-onset anxiety incidence was 15% at 24 months post-ICD implantation, with higher rates in women and the secondary 
prevention setting.146,181
People with ICDs and pacemakers exhibited similarly elevated anxiety levels.148
ACHD
A review found anxiety symptoms to be common both immediately after CV events or surgery and during follow-up.182
Anxiety prevalence was higher in people with ACHD (13%) compared with a historical cohort of people with non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma and German reference values (6%).183
PH/PAH
A total of 24 studies with 2161 people with PH reported a pooled prevalence of 37% for anxiety (95% CI 28.7–46.4).134
Smaller studies reported anxiety prevalence in people with PAH ranging from 9% to 58%, linked to disease severity.151–154
Anxiety incidence was higher in people with PAH living in urban areas and in non-smokers or non-drinkers compared with 
their counterparts.154

5.2.5. Chronic stress
Chronic stress, defined as the experience of physical and emotional im­
balance determined by life events and conditions, was found in 58% of 
people with CVD based on a systematic review (five studies, n = 533).16
A large observational study (n = 3572) reported that perceived stress 
was significantly higher in women vs men at baseline and 1 month after 
MI.213 Perceived chronic stress was associated with worse recovery in 
overall QoL and mental status among people with MI.213
Recent studies have focused on the concept of CV distress, defined 
as ‘a persistent negative emotional state rather than a transient state; involv­
ing multiple psychosocial domains; that challenges a person’s capacity to 
cope with living with their heart condition, the treatment of the condition, 
and the resultant changes to daily living; and challenges the person’s sense 
of self and future orientation’.214 This study, using the Cardiac Distress 
Inventory-Short Form (CDI-SF), found significantly higher scores on 
the CDI-SF among younger people and women.214 People with HF 
and elevated stress levels may undergo a more challenging disease tra­
jectory, characterized by a diminished QoL and heightened susceptibil­
ity to adverse events.215 Indeed, people with HF reporting high stress 
levels had a higher likelihood of adverse events during the study 
period.216
5.3. Addressing the mental health needs of 
informal caregivers for people with 
cardiovascular disease
Following the initial diagnosis, people may be asked to implement sub­
stantial lifestyle changes to reduce CV risk, prevent further disease pro­
gression, and enhance QoL.217 Coping with CVD and embracing new 
habits can prove challenging, and for adults, the primary source of sup­
port often comes from their informal caregivers, primarily their part­
ners.218,219 Partners are usually the most available and accessible 
persons for support, physically during hospitalizations and medical vis­
its, at home, and emotionally.220
The caregiving efforts of informal caregivers can exert a significant toll 
on themselves.31,35 Providing emotional and tangible support to a person 
coping with CVD may lead to caregiver emotional and/or physical strain. 
Some studies have identified mental health risks, such as increased levels 
of anxiety, depression, or CDI-PTSD among caregivers in the context of 
CVD.31–33,220 A recent review221 suggested that low to moderate levels 
of distress were common among family caregivers of people with CAD 
(prevalence ranging from 6% to 67% of caregivers). Family caregivers of 
people with HF cope with significantly higher physical and psychological 
health risks compared with non-caregivers.222 In the context of a VAD 
implantation, spouses have been found to have higher anxiety rates com­
pared with the person with the VAD,223 as well as lower mental QoL as a 
consequence of VAD-related disturbances in sexual activity.224
Despite ample literature documenting the adverse effects of caregiv­
ing, the person with CVD is seen as the sole focal point of attention and 
exclusive recipient of care, thus overlooking the needs of the informal 
caregiver.34 A shift in healthcare systems from focusing solely on indivi­
duals to adopting a holistic approach that includes the individual and 
their families, is needed. Family caregivers are essential collaborators, 
as they often ensure people can build change into their lives and adhere 
to their treatment plans. Educating and supporting informal caregivers 
represents not only a mechanism for improving long-term outcomes, 
but also a means of reducing healthcare costs through the avoidance 
of repeat engagements with the health system.225,226 Most importantly, 
caring for informal caregivers not only benefits the person living with 
CVD and reduces medical costs, but also reflects a holistic approach 
to CV practice. By supporting informal caregivers, a compassionate 
and sustainable healthcare system of CVD management is fostered, 
which is essential for the long-term success. Different Psycho-Cardio 
team members engage with informal caregivers at varying levels. 
Every team member should remain mindful of the challenges faced by 
those who care for a person living with CVD. Figure 6 outlines specific 
actions the Psycho-Cardio team members can take to assess and alle­
viate caregiver distress.

6.1. Awareness of needs in people with 
cardiovascular disease
Depression and anxiety can easily be overlooked in the routine care of 
people with CVD and/or considered ‘normal’ reactions to the clinical 
and prognostic burden of their disease. Given the high prevalence of 
mental health conditions among people with CVD, and their impact 
on outcomes and adherence, the possibility of evaluating mental health 
status at some point during professional encounters can be considered 
a worthy strategy to improve health. People with CVD with potential 
symptoms of mental health conditions should undergo formal screen­
ing and, at least, a low threshold for formal screening of mental health 
symptoms should be applied in people with CVD.
The recent manuscript ‘How your patient is really feeling: the emotional 
hinterland of a cardiac diagnosis’, written by individuals with CVD, illumi­
nates their experience.30 In this piece, people coping with CVD high­
light challenges faced when diagnosed, gaps in care, and unmet 
needs.30 Priorities, such as the need for an on demand, accessible, tai­
lored, and long-term multidisciplinary support network, are outlined. 
Suggestions for establishing the best possible person-centred support 
system and components for long-term support are outlined in 
Figure 7. Additional experiences of people coping with CVD, presented 
in the associated ‘Clinical cases and patient perspectives’ text, further 
highlight the importance of integrating mental health assessment within 
CVD care.

Figure 6 Suggestions for supporting informal caregivers of people living with cardiovascular disease.  
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
There is a multidirectional association between CVD and mental 
health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD, increasing 
each other’s risk.
(ii)
Mental health conditions in people with CVD, such as depression, can 
negatively affect self-management, including adherence to medication 
and lifestyle changes, and are associated with worse outcomes.
(iii)
The effects of anxiety and PTSD on adherence and CV outcomes are 
less clear and might be time-dependent.
(iv)
Caregivers play an essential role in supporting their family members 
who cope with CVD to incorporate lasting lifestyle changes and to 
adhere to treatment plans: assessing and supporting caregivers 
well-being benefits both parties.
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
It is reasonable to assess depression, anxiety, and PTSD in people 
with established CVD as they are highly prevalent and impact 
outcomes, and refer promptly to a professional when needed.
(ii)
Chronic stress and loneliness are associated with negative outcomes 
in people with CVD and should prompt referral if identified during 
clinical assessment.
(iii)
Incorporating informal caregiver well-being assessment and support 
is advisable in the holistic approach of mental and CV health.

6.2. Identification and screening
Taking a clinical history is an opportunity for the evaluation of potential 
symptoms and any history of mental health conditions. Conversations 
during the clinical course are further opportunities to identify previous­
ly unrecognized symptoms, the appearance of new difficulties, manifes­
tations of mental health conditions, or the need for help. These may 
indicate a requirement for more education relating to their condition(s) 
or support from social care services, which is not unusual in people with 
CVD.227
To ensure that people are being screened and treated for potential 
mental health conditions in addition to their underlying CVD, consider­
ation needs to be given to: (i) who will screen, (ii) when screening 
should be performed, (iii) which screening tools should be used, and 
(iv) how often screening should occur (Figure 8). Given that resources 
may vary across countries, hospitals, and specialized and general prac­
tices, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work. Collaboration with 
mental health professionals (the Psycho-Cardio team) can support de­
veloping a protocol for screening and guiding referrals based on severity

of mental health conditions and local situation. Ideally, screening for 
anxiety and depression should be conducted following a new diagnosis 
of CVD or acute CV event, at least once during follow-up and period­
ically (e.g. annually or when clinically indicated). Brief two-item screen­
ing measures ensure that the time needed for initial screening is limited 
(see Section 5.2.1). 
• When should the screening be done? Following a new diagnosis of CVD 
or acute CV event, periodically, at least once during follow-up, or 
when clinically indicated.
• How should screening be done? Via use of any valid and reliable short 
screening tool, appropriate to the setting and context.
• Who should screen? Any member of the Psycho-Cardio multidisciplin­
ary team who are appropriately qualified to do so.
Of note, screening by itself does not help people with CVD but in­
cludes responsibility to address and provide appropriate referral and 
treatment options. Further, it is important to acknowledge that screen­
ing has been linked to psychological harms (worry and anxiety) that re­
main underexplored in the context of CVD.228 A proposal for the who, 
when, and how of screening for mental health conditions in people with 
CVD is illustrated in Figure 8.
6.2.1. Assessment of depression and anxiety
Two-item screening tools, which only take a few minutes to answer, are 
the simplest way to assess depression and anxiety. We highlight three 
measures, the Whooley questions, the Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ)-2, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-2. Positive 
screens indicate the need for a longer screening measure. The 
Whooley questions are a two-item screening tool for the identification 
of depression that has shown high sensitivity and moderate specifi­
city,229 making this measure a useful initial screening tool for depres­
sion:32,230–233
The Whooley questions229
(i) During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling 
down, depressed, or hopeless?
(ii) During the past month, have you often been bothered by little 
interest or pleasure in doing things?
‘Yes’ to one (or both) questions = positive test (requires further 
evaluation).
‘No’ to both questions = negative test (not depressed).
The two-item and seven-item GAD questionnaires, and the 
two-item and nine-item PHQ tools for depression are widely used 
with good sensitivity and specificity in people with CVD.234–237 The 
GAD and PHQ have been translated into many languages and their 
use does not require a license agreement. Their psychometric proper­
ties are shown in Table 4.
Although it can be a challenging task to choose a screening tool, gen­
eric questionnaires are widely used. It is key to find a screening tool that 
is valid and reliable for people with CVD. The Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS) is widely used, including in people with 
CVD in the inpatient and outpatient setting. However, use of the 
HADS requires a license fee. The joint ESC societies statement on 
patient-reported outcome measures, referred to in Section 5.1.1,239
also notes the Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire, Cardiac Depression 
Scale, and Cardiac Distress Inventory can be considered as possible 
measures.

Mental health conditions can evolve over time and may be episodic. 
Therefore, professionals involved in the long-term management of peo­
ple with CVD need to be aware of their mental well-being, and its 
changes so, ideally, its assessment should be seamlessly integrated 
into routine care (Table 5). Supplementary data online, Tables S4–S6
offer examples of targeted questions that might be helpful to address 
specific aspects of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during clinical 
encounters.
The intensity of symptoms may also change over time. A recent 
study of people without distress at the time of ICD implant found 
that 14.5% developed new-onset anxiety and 11.3% new-onset de­
pression during 24 months of follow-up.146 One cue that might be 
helpful is to monitor scores at the time of first screening (e.g. 
when being implanted with the ICD), as people with a high score 
at that time are more likely to also have an increased score at 
follow-up.240
The value of routine screening is still debated, therefore robust 
mandates have been avoided. The Comparison of Depression 
Interventions After Acute Coronary Syndrome: Quality of Life 
(CODIACS-QoL) RCT is one of few studies where screening for 
depression within 2–12 months post-ACS with or without providing 
depression treatment, did not alter quality-adjusted life years, 
depression-free days, or led to harm.235 Nonetheless, European and 
American Guidelines recommend assessment and screening for de­
pression and anxiety (usually during hospitalization), although do 
not specify how often.132,241–244 Therefore, the optimal timing of 
screening within different CV conditions is not established. This 
Task Force considers it prudent to screen people after a new diagno­
sis of CVD or a CV event, then periodically (e.g. annually and at least 
once during follow-up), and when clinical judgement indicates that it is 
needed (Table 5). Screening can be conducted during hospitalization if 
time permits.
6.2.2. Suggested approach to screening people with 
cardiovascular disease for psychological distress, 
depression, and anxiety
There are two ways in which people can be assessed: (i) by means of a 
clinical diagnostic interview, or (ii) screening by a questionnaire that can 
identify symptom levels but not deliver a diagnosis.
In clinical practice the diagnostic interview may be lengthy, requires 
specific expertise, and thus is likely untenable to perform as a routine 
practice in most clinical settings. However, given that elevated scores 
on a screening questionnaire as well as a diagnosis of depression or anx­
iety increases the risk of morbidity, mortality, and poor QoL, question­
naires are a reasonable starting point. High scores on a screening 
instrument should lead to referral to a mental health professional for 
assessment and/or diagnosis. Questionnaires also provide the means 
for monitoring changes in symptoms over time. As noted previously, 
there are several options with respect to questionnaires to choose 
from and it is important to know the reliability, validity, and appropriate 
usage of the instruments.
6.2.3. Challenges in specific cardiovascular conditions
In people with HF, depression and anxiety can easily be overlooked in 
routine care due to overlapping symptoms, such as fatigue, apathy, lack 
of energy, and sleep disorders. Thus, there is a risk that both people 
with HF and healthcare professionals may misinterpret the situation. 
Depression and anxiety can also be considered ‘normal’ reactions to 
the clinical and prognostic burden of HF. Although routine screening 
for mental health conditions using validated questionnaires and tools is 
advised during hospitalization and follow-up,29,241 it is still not clear 
when and where to screen people with HF. The diagnosis of mental 
health conditions can also be affected by the continuous fluctuations of 
HF symptoms that can interfere with mood and psychology.241,245,246

Psychosocial assessment is an essential component of the evaluation 
of candidates for VAD, mainly aimed at identifying targets for treatment 
and improvement before the procedure, but also identifying potential 
contraindication in some candidates (e.g. uncontrolled psychiatric con­
ditions, consistent non-adherence, active substance abuse). A consen­
sus document on psychosocial assessment in advanced HF,247
endorsed by multiple societies, defined the main domains to evaluate as: 
• Risk factors for poor post-HTx or VAD outcomes.
• Capacity to engage in decision-making.
• Personal and environmental resources.
• Capacity to operate VAD.
Two scores have been used for psychosocial assessment in HTx: 
the Psychosocial Assessment of Candidates for Transplantation 
(PACT) and the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for 
Transplantation (SIPAT). Both have shown good predictive capacity to 
identify people at risk of post-HTx non-adherence and psychosocial 
complications,248,249 although their impact on clinical outcomes is un­
clear. These tools have not been validated in the VAD population.
Quality of life and mental health assessment are needed in people 
with pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to the high reported preva­
lence of depression and anxiety (see Section 5, Tables 1 and 2), but there 
is lack of evidence on the ideal timing or specific method. The HADS 
may be a useful tool, since it was able to rule out anxiety and depression 
disorder with a negative predictive value of 90% in a PH population.250
6.2.4. Assessment of subjective well-being and quality 
of life
The WHO-5 questionnaire, available in 30 languages,251,252 can be used 
to assess SWB and does not require a license fee. A percentage score 
<50 (or a raw score <13) has been suggested as a cut-off for poor men­
tal well-being and as an indication for further assessment for the pos­
sible presence of a mental health condition (e.g. depressive disorder).
Patient-reported measures such as QoL are seen as essential in clin­
ical practice as well as in clinical trials as ways to assess symptoms, func­
tion, well-being, perspectives, and undisclosed problems. Several 
disease-specific QoL instruments are available, valid in specific condi­
tions such as HF, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), AF, congenital heart 
disease, and PH. Generic measures such as the Short-Form 12 or 36 
or EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire are often used as 
well. Most QoL instruments include items related to mental health sta­
tus as well as physical health, which can alert a healthcare professional 
to a need for screening for mental health conditions. These instruments 
are being incorporated into electronic medical records in some sys­
tems, but implementation of regular QoL assessment is hindered by 
limited integration into clinical practice and interpretation of scores. 
However, electronic medical records and automated systems should 
in future simplify assessment of well-being, QoL, and mental health con­
ditions at regular intervals. A full list of these measures can be found in a 
recent ESC statement on ‘Placing patient-reported outcomes at the 
centre of CV clinical practice’.239
6.3. Management of mental health 
conditions in people with cardiovascular 
disease
Given the negative impact of poorer mental health on adherence to 
medication and lifestyle, QoL, prognosis, and costs, people with an in­
creased symptom score on anxiety and/or depression questionnaires 
and those with a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, depression, or PTSD, 
should be considered potential candidates for receiving treatment. 
Although evidence is sparse that people with CVD screened for anxiety 
and depression and treated afterwards have a better prognosis,235 there 
are a few promising studies. A retrospective cohort study of people 
with depression who received psychotherapies via primary care services 
(n  = 636 955), reported that intervention-driven improvements in 
depression symptoms were associated with a lower risk of any-cause 
new-onset CVD (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.86–0.89). Subanalyses suggested 
the association was greater in those <60 years of age.253 In recognition 
of the different levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD experi­
enced, and therefore the different needs with respect to treatment, a 
stepped care approach (Figure 9) would be one way forward.254–257
Stepped care takes into account people’s preferences and can be adapted 
to symptom severity and resources available, and does not mean that all 
earlier steps need to be done before accessing higher level support.
6.3.1. Communication, education, and support for 
people with mental health conditions and 
cardiovascular disease
Effective communication is a cornerstone of healthcare delivery, foster­
ing person-centred care, and addressing the complex interplay between 
mental and physical health.258 Proportional stress, anxiety, or fear may 
be normal reactions after a diagnosis of CVD, acute CV events, CV pro­
cedures or interventions, or their complications. Empathy and active lis­
tening are essential to understanding the potential difficulties and 
worries the person with CVD and their family members may face. It 
is important to recognize that challenges may not only be due to the 
physical consequences of CVD or its therapy. Rather, healthcare pro­
fessionals must appreciate the full spectrum of mental and emotional 
consequences, as well as the impacts this may have on lifestyle, profes­
sional, family, social, or economic factors as presented in the associated 
‘Clinical cases and patient perspectives’ document. Healthcare profes­
sionals should ensure that people receive support for both physical and 
mental health needs, preventing or attenuating unwanted psychological 
or emotional reactions, and potentially improving therapeutic adher­
ence and clinical outcomes.259
Open dialogue with people with CVD, family, and caregivers, 
adapted to their age, cultural level, beliefs, and preferences, is essen­
tial.260 Answering questions, solving doubts and clarifying uncertainties 
is a key aspect of therapeutic relationships and may help prevent mis­
understandings and irrational fears.261 While in ECR programmes there 
is more time and opportunity for communication, this may be challen­
ging to deliver in acute or critical care and in outpatient care, where 
time pressure is constant. In these settings, time for high-quality com­
munication should be facilitated.
Multiple individual, professional, condition-specific, and organization­
al factors including health literacy, mental health issues, and time pres­
sures, impact the quality of communication. The impact of mental 
health on communication may be particularly strong in people with 
SMI. Shared decision-making (SDM), in which the person coping with 
CVD and professionals discuss evidence and options for treatment, 
and people are supported to make informed decisions, is dependent 
on good communication. A systematic review and meta-analysis of in­
terventions to increase SDM in CVD found that the interventions re­
duced decisional conflict and increased knowledge across a wide 
range of CVD conditions and formats.262
Compassion in CVD care is an important element in communication 
and understanding. More information on compassionate care can be 
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               23

found in supplementary data online, and Table S7. Caregivers and family 
involvement can improve mental well-being and CV outcomes; a para­
digm shift in the organization of care may be needed to include the per­
son’s social environment into treatment. More information can be 
found in the supplementary data online.
6.3.2. Psychological interventions
A broad range of strategies, from cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), 
psycho-education, and mindfulness-based techniques to lifestyle modi­
fication programmes and support groups, including internet-based in­
terventions and mobile health (mHealth) solutions, have been 
proposed as psychological therapeutic options for people with CVD.263
6.3.3. Psycho-education
Psycho-education is an intervention with structured knowledge trans­
fer about an illness and its treatment, integrating emotional and motiv­
ational aspects to enable people to cope with the illness and to improve 
its treatment adherence and effectiveness.264 It is considered an im­
portant component of treatment in both medical and mental health 
conditions.265 A psycho-educational approach is already embedded 
within multiple CV care settings, including ECR and secondary preven­
tion programmes. It includes education on the underlying disease and 
current risk factors and suggestions for lifestyle modifications. Based 
on the results of a recent synthesis of RCTs (n = 8748 people 
post-MI or revascularization), a psycho-educational approach should in­
tegrate several modes of delivery and preferably last for at least 3 
months.266 The effects of psycho-educational interventions on depres­
sion and anxiety symptoms when combined in meta-analysis are large 
based on accepted thresholds.267
For people with arrhythmias and/or ICD for primary or secondary 
prevention, there are physical symptoms, such as sleep disturbance, fa­
tigue, and also psychological fears (fear of shocks, worry about the fu­
ture, and fear of ICD dysfunction) affecting QoL. Psycho-education 
improved the physical component summary of QoL but had no effect 
on mental component summary scores.268 In people with AF,

reductions in serious adverse events [risk ratio (RR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.63– 
0.97], anxiety, depression, and health-related QoL (HRQoL) were ob­
served with psycho-education, although the incidence of AF episodes 
was not affected.269
6.3.4. Social prescribing
Social prescribing is a transformative healthcare approach that connects 
people with non-medical resources to enhance their holistic well-being. 
The core idea behind social prescribing is to provide people with per­
sonalized interventions that extend beyond traditional medical pre­
scriptions, encompassing a spectrum of community-based activities 
and resources.270,271 The aim is to address diverse aspects of mental 
health, such as social isolation, loneliness, stress, and anxiety, by facilitat­
ing access to supportive community activities. Social prescribing le­
verages a variety of activities, ranging from arts workshops, music 
therapy, and group dance sessions to support networks, to enhance 
mental well-being and cultivate a sense of belonging and purpose.
Engagement in community activities, such as group dance, hiking, 
and cooking classes, combats feelings of isolation and fosters meaningful 
social interactions, thereby bolstering mental well-being.272,273
These community connections act as protective factors against stress 
and isolation, potentially enhancing mental health support for people 
with CVD. This can lead to reductions in depressive symptoms, im­
provements in QoL, and better adherence to CV treatment plans.270
A systematic review of 17 studies involving 13 social prescribing inter­
ventions with a total of 5036 participants found statistically significant 
improvements in mental health, general well-being, and QoL in 16 
of the studies.274 Despite these promising findings, more research fo­
cusing specifically on people with CVD is necessary to draw reliable 
conclusions.
Interventions involving social professionals were found to be more 
effective for reducing anxiety and depression, while those involving 
health professionals had a greater impact on improving blood pressure 
and encouraging physical activity.275 Participating in arts, including visual 
art therapy and music therapy, has shown positive effects on mood and 
emotional regulation.276 Music, in particular, can be a powerful tool in 
reducing stress and enhancing mood in people with CVD. Activities 
such as gardening, green exercise, and nature walks have been effective 
in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure and have demonstrated 
moderate to large effects on depression and anxiety scores.275,277
These interventions also increase daily step counts, though the overall 
impact on physical activity time is still being evaluated.
Technology plays a pivotal role in facilitating social prescribing. 
Mobile apps and online platforms can recommend suitable social pre­
scriptions based on personal profiles and mental health assessments, 
serving as valuable resources for people to explore options, engage 
in virtual support groups, and track their progress.278 Real-time data 
collection through these platforms allows healthcare professionals to 
monitor engagement and outcomes more effectively.279 Integrating so­
cial prescribing into standard care pathways, fostering community part­
nerships, and leveraging technology ensures efficient and personalized 
recommendations. This approach aligns with modern healthcare para­
digms, emphasizing holistic well-being and personalized interventions, 
particularly for people with CVD dealing with mental health concerns, 
although more research is needed.280 There is growing evidence sup­
porting the use of social prescribing in the management of CVD. 
Healthcare professionals should be aware of local social prescribing in­
terventions and availability in their environment and refer when 
appropriate.
6.3.5. Other psychological interventions
A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of psycho­
logical interventions for CHD including relaxation, cognitive techni­
ques, emotional support and/or client-led discussion, and adjunct 
pharmacology, reported a reduction in CV mortality (from 7.3% to 
5.5%) with psychological interventions compared with usual care con­
trols.281 No between-group differences were observed for the rates 
of total mortality, non-fatal MI, or revascularization procedures. 
Psychological interventions were found to achieve small to moderate 
improvements in depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress compared 
with controls, although there remains some uncertainty in these 
estimates.281
Cognitive-behavioural therapy is a psychological intervention that fo­
cuses on changing patterns of unhelpful thinking and behaviour.282 Two 
recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of 
CBT-based interventions in RCTs in people with CAD showed that 
CBT-based interventions can reduce CV events, MI, and angina dur­
ation and intensity at the end of follow-up. Findings varied by trials, 
with no effect on other clinical outcomes,283 but improving significantly 
psychological outcomes, such as depressive symptoms, anxiety, depres­
sion, stress, and increasing vital satisfaction at the end of follow-up.284
A recent study assessing the effect of CBT has shown efficacy in im­
proving AF-specific QoL for people with symptomatic paroxysmal AF. 
AF-CBT led to large improvements, reducing healthcare-related con­
sumption by 56%, although the AF burden remained unchanged.285 A 
further RCT testing a CBT intervention in young people with CAD 
showed improvement in the total HADS score after 3 months, with dif­
ferences maintained after 6 months. The intervention group also had 
greater adherence to ECR and more improvement in HRQoL at 6 
months. A significant reduction in CVD-related admissions at 12 
months was also observed.286
Recently, a multicentre study in which 250 people with AMI were 
randomized after PCI to either control or cognitive-behavioural stress 
management detected that the latter improves anxiety, depression, 
and QoL but does not affect MACE.287 However, another trial of 
362 people who had experienced a CVD event randomized to usual 
care or usual care plus CBT, found that CBT decreased the risk of re­
current events including MI.288 Cognitive-based or external support 
coping mechanisms seem to attenuate the mental impact of PH, de­
creasing anxiety or depression rates.289 This suggests a potential 
benefit for early identification and psychological intervention. In 
fact, psychosocial support has a Class I recommendation in the cur­
rent ESC/European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines for the diag­
nosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension,290 and is endorsed in 
the 2024 ESC Guidelines for the management of chronic coronary 
syndromes.242
Cognitive-behavioural therapy is safe and has shown to have benefi­
cial effects in improving mental symptoms, in particular depression, and 
QoL in people with CVD and HF, and it could be a valid option due to 
the lack of potential side effects or drug interactions. However, a small 
qualitative study found that some people reported side effects, includ­
ing discomfort with treatment and worsening of symptoms.287,289,291
Exposure therapy can be helpful for people with CVD, who due to 
their disease stop doing the things that they used to enjoy due to fear of 
another CV event, which may lead to depression. An example is a per­
son who experiences an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) while 
cycling. Often this will cause anxiety and fear of taking up cycling again, 
as cycling is associated with OHCA. However, exposure therapy, 
where the therapist exposes the person gradually and in a safe way 
to situations and activities that they fear, is often helpful.292
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               25

Similarly, behavioural activation uses behaviours to influence emo­
tional state as engaging in activities that increase social connections 
and feelings of well-being can decrease depression. A pragmatic RCT 
in 416 people with HF and comorbid depression compared the effect­
iveness of antidepressant medication vs behavioural activation psycho­
therapy. Both groups experienced equal benefits with close to a 50% 
reduction in depressive symptoms at 3, 6, and 12 months.293 People re­
ceiving behavioural activation psychotherapy had significantly better 
physical HRQoL and HF-specific HRQoL. Although there is limited evi­
dence within CVD, some people have reported that philosophical 
counselling (Supplementary data online, Table S8) can be a complemen­
tary approach to other therapeutic strategies.
6.3.6. Interventions for people with post-traumatic 
stress disorder
Limited evidence on the prevention and management of CDI-PTSD is 
available. A comparison of eye movement desensitization and repro­
cessing (EMDR) with imaginal exposure in 42 people with PTSD in­
duced by life-threatening CV events, including surgery, MI, and 
cardiac arrest, showed EMDR significantly reduced CDI-PTSD symp­
toms at 4 weeks and 6 months.294 Fifty-one people with PTSD symp­
toms due to a CV event randomized to imaginal exposure or control 
group reported improved PTSD symptoms compared with the control 
group, although this difference was not statistically significant due to the 
small sample size. This initial study in the field of exposure psychothera­
pies provides promising evidence for the safety of using this technique 
in people with CVD.295
In a more recent RCT designed to determine if trauma-focused 
counselling within 48 h of hospital admission could prevent the devel­
opment of PTSS, 190 people with ACS experiencing distress were as­
signed to either trauma-focused counselling (one session) or a general 
stress management active control group. Results showed fewer bene­
ficial effects for the trauma-focused counselling group compared with 
the control group.296
6.3.7. Lifestyle interventions
Adopting a holistic approach that includes lifestyle changes can effect­
ively improve mental health, CV well-being, risk factors, and CV out­
comes.297–302 Examples of lifestyle changes include regular physical 
activity, a balanced diet, stress management techniques (such as mind­
fulness and yoga), adequate sleep, and positive coping strategies.303,304
6.3.8. Physical activity and exercise in people with 
cardiovascular disease and mental health conditions
Physical activity encompasses a wide range of bodily movements that 
increase energy expenditure, including everyday tasks such as walking, 
household chores, and active commuting. Exercise is a more structured 
and purposeful form of physical activity designed to enhance or main­
tain physical fitness. The benefits of exercise in people with CVD ex­
tend beyond improving physical health; it also significantly enhances 
psychological well-being, including reassurance in those who are con­
cerned for potential recurrences of their event or worsening of their 
disease. Exercise induces the release of endorphins and other neuroac­
tive substances, contributing to mood improvement and stress reduc­
tion.305 These effects are particularly beneficial for people with CVD, 
who often face psychological challenges in addition to their physical 
health issues.306 In people with CAD and depression, exercise has 
been shown to be an effective component of treatment. A network 
meta-analysis (33 RCTs, n = 7240) demonstrated that exercise, when 
combined with antidepressants and psychotherapy, significantly re­
duced depressive symptoms at 8 weeks. The study suggested that while 
antidepressants remained effective at 26 weeks, the addition of exercise 
could enhance overall treatment efficacy.307
For people with HF, the Heart Failure-A Controlled Trial 
Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) demon­
strated that exercise training led to a modest but significant decline in 
depression symptoms at both 3 and 12 months, as evidenced by im­
provements in the Beck Depression Inventory score in the exercise 
group. The study emphasized that while exercise is beneficial, the 
type and duration should be tailored to functional capacity, with consid­
erations for independent or supervised exercise programmes.308,309
In summary, exercise is a critical component of managing CVD in 
adults, particularly for those with HF and CAD. Its benefits include im­
provements in both physical and mental health, which are crucial for en­
hancing the overall QoL in people with CVD.
6.3.9. Diet and nutrition approaches in cardiovascular 
disease and mental health conditions
Dietary interventions and nutritional strategies hold promise for im­
proving both CVD310 and mental health outcomes in individuals with 
CVD. However, the current evidence specifically addressing mental 
health improvements through dietary changes in this population is lim­
ited, highlighting the need for more robust and targeted research to es­
tablish clear recommendations.
Several dietary patterns have been explored for their potential men­
tal health benefits in people with CVD. The Mediterranean diet, rich in 
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, has been associated 
with lower rates of depression and cognitive decline in the general 
population, but data specific to people with CVD are still emer­
ging.311,312 Some studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties 
of this diet could be beneficial, yet conclusive evidence in CVD popula­
tions is lacking.313,314
Fasting interventions, including intermittent fasting and calorie re­
striction, have also been examined for potential to improve mental 
health. While some studies report encouraging results, such as im­
provements in mood and cognitive function, these findings are prelim­
inary. The evidence is not yet strong enough to endorse one fasting 
method over another, particularly for individuals with psychiatric 
conditions.314,315
The Omega-3 Supplementation for Co-Morbid Depression and 
Heart Failure Treatment (OCEAN) trial reported that supplementa­
tion with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in people 
with HF (n = 108) led to positive changes in cognitive depressive symp­
toms and social functioning. However, the small sample size and the use 
of soft endpoints suggest that these findings should be interpreted with 
caution, and larger, more definitive trials are needed.316
While dietary approaches and nutritional interventions are appealing 
for their potential dual benefits on CV and mental health in people with 
CVD, current evidence is insufficient to advise on diet interventions. 
More rigorous studies are needed to determine the most effective diet­
ary strategies for improving mental health outcomes in this population.
6.3.10. Smoking cessation
Tobacco cessation offers significant CV health benefits, particularly for 
individuals with mental health conditions, including those with SMI. 
However, addressing tobacco use in this population is challenging due 
to the complex interplay between addiction and mental health issues. 
Sustained tobacco abstinence over 52 weeks can significantly reduce


<!-- PAGE 27 -->

### Page 27

the 10 year CV risk in people with SMI.317 Despite these CV benefits, 
individuals often face significant challenges post-cessation, such as not­
able weight gain, which can contribute to high rates of obesity, diabetes, 
and hypertension.318 The addictive nature of tobacco use, especially in 
individuals with mental health conditions, necessitates treating tobacco 
use as an addiction and addressing it with comprehensive strategies.
Addressing tobacco cessation in individuals with mental health con­
ditions requires a tailored approach. The Five A’s model (Ask, Advise, 
Assess, Assist, Arrange) is a structured method commonly used to en­
courage and support tobacco cessation. However, it should be adapted 
to meet the unique needs of those with mental health conditions. For 
instance, healthcare professionals should be particularly attentive when 
assessing a person’s readiness to quit, considering his or her mental 
health status, and providing additional support and resources that ad­
dress both their tobacco use and mental health needs.
Cognitive therapies, when combined with medication, have been 
shown to improve tobacco abstinence rates in adults, including those 
with mental health conditions. A review of 21 RCTs found that cogni­
tive therapies combined with medication or nicotine replacement ther­
apy are more effective than medication alone, although the quality of 
evidence varied.319 While tobacco cessation is crucial for improving 
CV and overall health in people with mental health conditions, it re­
quires a nuanced and supportive approach that considers the complex­
ities of addiction in this population.
6.3.11. Stress management techniques
Mindfulness,320 meditation,321 and progressive muscle relaxation322–324
are stress management techniques that have shown promise in foster­
ing cognitive resilience, emotional regulation, and relaxation. However, 
their specific effects on people with CVD need careful consideration 
and evidence-based discussion.325–327
Mindfulness involves focused attention on the present moment, 
fostering cognitive resilience against stressors and aiding emotional regu­
lation.320 A study of mindfulness on people with CVD showed improve­
ments in psychological well-being and CV markers.325 Mindfulness-based 
interventions for adults aged 19 to 40 years in developed countries, in­
cluding mindfulness-based stress reduction programmes, mindfulness- 
based cognitive therapy programmes, and the Learning 2 BREATHE 
(Body, Reflections/thoughts, Emotions, Attention, Tenderness, Habits, 
Empowerment) programme, generally improve well-being and can be ef­
fectively implemented in a virtual format.325
Meditation focuses on controlled breathing or visualization, trigger­
ing the parasympathetic nervous system to induce relaxation and re­
duce stress hormones.321 A meta-analysis indicated that distress 
management, when combined with ECR, offers limited additional ef­
fects, suggesting that meditation should be integrated cautiously with 
existing ECR programmes.328 A further study showed that meditation 
can reduce stress and improve CV health outcomes in people with 
CVD.326 Meditation and mindfulness, especially evidence-based forms 
like mindfulness-based stress reduction, can support people with 
CVD and their caregivers to reduce anxiety, depression, and pain. 
These practices have shown structural and functional brain changes, 
translate well across different populations, and offer a low-cost, bene­
ficial method to complement treatment during this crisis.326
Progressive muscle relaxation involves sequentially tensing and re­
leasing muscle groups to promote physical and mental relaxation, coun­
tering stress-induced physiological manifestations such as elevated 
heart rate, increased blood pressure, and muscle tension.322–324
A study demonstrated that progressive muscle relaxation could reduce 
anxiety and improve heart rate variability in individuals with CVD.327
6.3.12. Sleep hygiene
Sleep quality is integral to both CV health and mental well-being, particu­
larly in individuals with CVD. Poor sleep quality and insufficient sleep dur­
ation are linked to various adverse CV outcomes, including mortality,329
atherosclerosis,330 hypertension, impaired glucose metabolism, and in­
creased inflammatory markers, and associated with an elevated risk of 
mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, which can fur­
ther complicate the management of CVD.331–333 It is important for 
healthcare professionals to routinely inquire about sleep quality during 
clinical evaluations, given the significant impact of sleep on both CV 
and mental health. Interventions that improve sleep quality such as sleep 
hygiene measures and CBT for insomnia have been shown to improve 
mental health conditions.331 Healthcare professionals should encourage 
people to adopt specific sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a 
consistent sleep schedule, avoiding stimulants like caffeine or nicotine 
close to bedtime, limiting screen exposure in the evening, and creating 
a restful sleep environment with minimal noise and light.331 While wear­
ables like smartwatches offer insights into sleep patterns, their diagnostic 
accuracy remains limited, and they should be complemented by validated 
clinical assessments and evidence-based interventions.
6.4. Tools and resources to support 
lifestyle change
6.4.1. Digital health tools
Among the many new mobile apps released every day for monitoring 
personal health data, only a minority have been scientifically validated 
on healthcare behavioural and clinical outcomes in the CV field. A sys­
tematic review encompassing 39 studies of wearable devices in multiple 
CVDs found potential benefits mainly in lifestyle aspects like physical ac­
tivity and smoking cessation. However, the same review highlighted 
safety, reliability, and regulation concerns.334 A systematic review and 
meta-analysis of mobile phone and mHealth interventions in people 
who had experienced a coronary event (20 studies, n = 4535) reported 
benefits in exercise capacity, physical activity, reductions in all-cause and 
CV readmissions, and improved physical and mental QoL.335 A 
meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of a digital health intervention in peo­
ple with CVD showed that telemonitoring reduced depression in people 
with HF and CAD, and device-based psychological education and training 
had a significant positive effect in reducing depression in people with 
CAD or ICD. Although the use of information and communication tech­
nologies for health (eHealth) in daily practice is promising, there are still 
several barriers, including reimbursement challenges, digital literacy is­
sues, and unequal access to digital technology (digital divide) in low- 
income countries or in remote areas as well as in the elderly.336
6.4.2. Motivational interviewing
Motivational interviewing (MotInt) is a person-centred counselling style 
for addressing the common problem of ambivalence about healthy life­
style changes. It can be an effective counselling approach that bolsters 
motivation by resolving ambivalence. Motivational interviewing has 
shown efficacy in helping to make healthy behavioural changes and con­
trol CV risk factors with some evidence that shows an effect on the 
management of depression.337 More information about MotInt can 
be found in the supplementary data online.
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               27

6.4.3. Cardiac rehabilitation
Cardiac rehabilitation is a comprehensive multicomponent programme 
of secondary prevention aiming to reduce CVD risk and optimize 
health and well-being. A key component of most cardiac rehabilitation 
programmes is structured exercise (ECR) along with other compo­
nents such as assessment, education, psychosocial support, informa­
tion, behavioural interventions, and risk factor management.338,339
Meta-analyses have shown that ECR is effective in improving mortality, 
morbidity, and HRQoL outcomes across multiple CV conditions,340–344
but few meta-analyses provide evidence of improvement in measures 
of mental health.343–345 These have found only weak evidence and small 
effects of ECR on depression and anxiety symptoms in people with 
CVD, even when psychological interventions were added.328,344–346
These results may be surprising given that psychosocial management 
is one of the core components of comprehensive ECR,347 and exercise 
has been shown to have beneficial effects on the risk for and symptoms 
of depression and anxiety. Possible explanations include lack of sys­
tematic measurement of mental health outcomes, lack of recruitment 
of people with mental health conditions, and reluctance of people with 
mental health conditions to attend ECR or participate in studies. 
Screening for depression and anxiety in ECR is advocated,348 but has 
been found to be inconsistently implemented with variation across 
conditions and services.349 A position statement from the European 
Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC)348 advises screening 
for mental health conditions and referral to a psychologist or psych­
iatrist when needed.
Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation has the potential to benefit 
people with mild to moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, 
and stress, but studies and evaluation are essential. One recent 
RCT trained ECR staff to deliver metacognitive therapy to people with 
CVD (n = 332) and demonstrated significant small to moderate improve­
ment in depression and anxiety scores compared with ECR alone.350
Suggestions for ensuring mental health benefit from ECR include: 
• Screening for mental health conditions by ECR staff at the start and 
end of programme.
• Improving the implementation of screening through Guidelines com­
bined with local/national initiatives to support screening.351
• Determining optimal interventions in ECR to improve symptoms of 
mental health conditions, including who should deliver these.
• Collaborating with mental health experts to ensure psychosocial 
support in ECR is robust and that referrals can be made when 
appropriate.
• Evaluating mental health symptoms as an outcome in ECR. The EAPC 
advocates a goal of improvement of depression and anxiety symptom 
scores by 10% on valid measures.348
6.5. Medical interventions
Medical interventions including pharmacotherapy may be needed for 
people with CVD with diagnosed mental health conditions and for peo­
ple with severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD. Careful as­
sessment of the risks and benefits and open dialogue as recommended 
in Section 6.3 will facilitate decision-making.
6.5.1. Efficacy and safety of pharmacological 
treatment for mental health conditions in people 
with cardiovascular disease
Studies evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for 
mental health conditions in CV populations have shown inconsistent 
results. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs of anti­
depressant treatment following ACS found no general improvement 
in all-cause mortality and recurrent MI while the risk of repeat hospital­
ization was significantly reduced. However, in people with a concomi­
tant diagnosis of depression, antidepressants decreased the odds of 
recurrent MI.352 A Cochrane review examining trials on psychological 
treatments and antidepressant drugs in adults with CAD and comorbid 
depression concluded that pharmacological interventions may have a 
large effect on end-of-treatment depression symptoms, while effects 
on mortality or CV endpoints were deemed uncertain.353
Studies on the safety of antidepressant medication in HF have yielded 
conflicting results. One meta-analysis indicated that the use of antide­
pressants in people with HF is associated with an increased risk of all- 
cause death regardless of whether they have clinical depression or the 
type of antidepressants used.354 In contrast, a recent meta-analysis re­
viewing studies of people with depression and known HF in both out­
patient and hospital settings indicated that selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) seem to be a safe treatment option.355 This analysis, 
however, was limited by the variety of study designs and mixed results 
for different antidepressants.
Given the inconsistency of findings across studies on the effective­
ness of pharmacological treatment for mental health conditions in peo­
ple with CVD, there is a clear need for larger and robust RCTs. 
Concerns about drug safety, CV side effects, and interactions between 
psychiatric medications and CVD treatments complicate this manage­
ment and need to be clarified in future research.
6.5.2. Use of specific medications in people with 
depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress 
disorders and cardiovascular disease
In the treatment of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, antidepressants are 
the first-line pharmacological treatment, while additional medications 
including anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics, may be used in the short 
term. Other drugs, such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, may 
also be used, depending on the severity of symptoms. A brief descrip­
tion of the most common medications used for the treatment of mental 
health conditions is given in Supplementary data online, Table S9. 
Figure 10 provides an algorithm for the pharmacological treatment of 
depression, anxiety, and PTSD in CVD.
6.5.3. Use of antidepressants
• The use of antidepressants in CVD populations requires careful se­
lection of medications, dosage adjustments, and close monitoring 
due to potential side effects and clinically relevant drug interactions. 
In general, newer antidepressants are considered safe and asso­
ciated with few serious long-term side effects in people with 
CVD.356–358 However, CVD side effects may occur and are typically 
exerted through noradrenergic activation resulting from the use of 
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), nor­
epinephrine reuptake inhibitors, noradrenergic and specific seroto­
nergic antidepressants, that can cause orthostatic hypotension or 
hypertension.359
• Weight gain (e.g. through mirtazapine use) may worsen CV risk.
• QTc prolongation can increase the risk of polymorphic ventricular 
arrhythmias, which has been associated with some tricyclic antide­
pressants (TCAs), SSRIs, and other antidepressants and bupropion, 
although the evidence is inconsistent.360 A large population study 
did not find an increased risk of arrhythmias for citalopram.361 A net­
work meta-analysis demonstrated a low risk of ventricular

arrhythmia and SCD among people using antidepressants like SNRIs, 
SSRIs, and especially TCAs.362 Some antidepressants (mirtazapine, 
venlafaxine, trazodone) were not found to prolong the QTc interval 
in healthy volunteers.363–365
• Reduction of heart rate variability has been associated with TCA 
use.366,367
• Temporary increase in blood pressure immediately after administra­
tion has been described with esketamine, which is indicated for 
treatment-resistant depression, however, it is not associated with 
long-term development of hypertension.368
Importantly, several pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interac­
tions between antidepressants and CV drugs may affect the efficacy 
and safety of treatment. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring, de­
fined as the measurement and interpretation of drug concentrations 
in blood to optimize pharmacotherapy, is proposed in special clinical 
scenarios. It is particularly useful in cases of non-response at thera­
peutic doses, uncertain drug adherence, suboptimal tolerability, or 
pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions. In people with mental health 
disorders, therapeutic drug monitoring has additional applications 
ranging from strongly recommended to potentially useful including 
use in children and adolescents, pregnant women, elderly people, in­
dividuals with intellectual disabilities, people with substance abuse dis­
orders, forensic psychiatric conditions, or people with known or 
suspected pharmacokinetic abnormalities.369
Many antidepressants and CV drugs are metabolized by cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzymes leading to potential interactions, which are dose 
dependent and can be exaggerated by smoking (Supplementary data 
online, Table S10). Smoking is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 enzymes 
with maximal increase by 10 or more cigarettes per day and decrease 
of CYP1A2 activity within 3 days after smoking cessation.370,371
Potential risks for interactions between antidepressants and CV drugs 
include beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. For example, SSRIs 
inhibit the enzyme activity phase of the CYP pathway by blocking the 
active site of certain CYP isoenzymes, thereby reducing the metabolism 
of other drugs. This may lead, for example, to increased plasma levels of 
metoprolol with a risk of bradycardia or hypotension. Furthermore, 
amiodarone inhibits CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, leading to po­
tential interactions with both SSRIs and TCAs, requiring careful moni­
toring for side effects.369
Notably, SSRIs and SNRIs can increase bleeding risk.372 However, 
there is little evidence that SSRIs increase the risk of clinically relevant 
bleedings or mortality.373 Further, SSRI interactions via the CYP isoen­
zyme system can potentially increase the effects of warfarin and thus, 
the risk of major bleeding requiring close monitoring and management 
of risk factors for bleeding in people treated with both SSRI and vitamin 
K antagonists like warfarin.374 Although studies suggest that direct oral 
anticoagulants have lower potential for pharmacokinetic interactions 
with SSRIs, caution is also required with concomitant use of SSRI and 
direct oral anticoagulants, which showed a similarly increased risk 
of major bleeding as vitamin K antagonists.375,376 Potential interactions 
between antidepressants and drugs for SMI are summarized in 
Supplementary data online, Table S9.
6.5.4. Use of anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics
Anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics may be used to manage symptoms 
like anxiety and insomnia, which are common in the CVD population. 
However, potential benefits need to be balanced against risks, especially 
with long-term or high-dose use. If used, clinical evaluation should 
include assessment for suitability to switch to a safer alternative like 
SSRIs for anxiety, or CBT for insomnia. Further, these drugs are over­
used and overprescribed worldwide in the general population and es­
pecially among the elderly and people with mental health 
conditions.377 Benzodiazepine prescription, especially long-term or dai­
ly use, has been linked to an increased risk of all-cause mortality.378,379
These findings may be partly explained by residual confounding.380
Some studies also suggested that benzodiazepines may elevate the 
risk of CV events and mortality, particularly in older adults.381
6.5.5. Pharmacological treatment for mental health 
conditions in specific cardiovascular diseases
6.5.5.1. Ischaemic heart disease
Pharmacological treatment for IHD in people with mental health condi­
tions aims to reduce the symptoms of mental health conditions, improve 
CV outcomes, and reduce modifiable CV risk factors. In general, it is pref­
erable to avoid benzodiazepines routinely for managing AMI,382 and to be 
cautious about adding medications given the potential for interactions 
and possible side effects. In people who smoke, bupropion or varenicline 
can be used as they are effective and safe in reducing smoking in the short 
term.383,384 If a person with depression is being treated with mirtazapine, 
switching to other antidepressant drugs with less propensity to induce 
weight gain may be considered, in consultation with psychiatrists.356
6.5.5.2. Ventricular arrhythmias
In people with ventricular arrhythmias, it is necessary to evaluate the 
link between arrhythmias and the use of reported antidepressants. In 
the context of clinical suspicion, it is preferable to switch to drugs 
with less propensity to cause ventricular arrhythmias. Several antide­
pressants have shown a potential to change ventricular repolarization: 
(i) Citalopram/escitalopram possibly increase the risk of QTc pro­
longation in dosages over 20 mg compared with placebo.
(ii) TCAs are associated with increased risk of QTc prolongation com­
pared with newer antidepressants.
For more information on QTc prolongation associated with psycho­
tropic drugs see Section 7.6.1.
6.5.5.3. Heart failure
In people with HF, the efficacy of antidepressant and/or antipsychotic drugs 
is not well established.385 Therefore, careful assessment of risks and ben­
efits should be performed by a multidisciplinary Psycho-Cardio team be­
fore initiation. Indeed, despite mental health conditions increasing the 
risk for adverse outcomes and mortality in people with HF, the indiscrim­
inate use of antidepressants may increase the risk of CV side effects and 
drug interactions, especially among the elderly or frail. This is well summar­
ized in a position paper endorsed by the EAPC.386 In addition, the use of 
antidepressants has been associated with an increased risk for all-cause and 
CV mortality, irrespective of the presence of clinical depression.354,387
If antidepressants are needed: 
• SSRIs are considered the safer class of antidepressants to use in HF as 
they are associated with fewer adverse CV side effects (less likely to 
cause orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia, little effect on intraven­
tricular conduction).388 However, SSRIs can cause QTc prolongation, 
especially citalopram and escitalopram (but also sertraline and fluoxet­
ine), can increase the bleeding risk in elderly people receiving antiplate­
let or anticoagulant medications through their inhibition of platelet 
aggregation/activation, and enhance gastric acid secretion.372,389,390


<!-- PAGE 31 -->

### Page 31

• Due to their minimal inhibition of CYP enzymes, sertraline, citalo­
pram, and escitalopram have a lower risk of drug interactions com­
pared with fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and paroxetine.
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and TCAs should be avoided for the 
treatment of depression in HF as they may cause orthostatic hypo­
tension, worsening HF, and ventricular arrhythmias.391
• Venlafaxine and duloxetine should be used with caution in people 
with HF due to the small and contradictory evidence.392
The use of antidepressants in people with HF should be restricted to 
those with severe depression, where the risk of untreated depression 
outweighs the risk of taking antidepressants. The use of specific drugs 
for the treatment of HF can also be associated with the development 
of depression/anxiety: diuretics and nitrate esters are associated with 
a higher risk of depression in people with HF,393 while no increased 
risk of depression has been reported for beta-blockers (especially for 
the hydrophilic form since they do not significantly cross the blood/ 
brain barrier), statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angio­
tensin receptor blockers, aspirin, aldosterone antagonists, and sodium– 
glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors.393,394
6.5.5.4. Procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous 
coronary intervention)
In general, the use of benzodiazepines is not indicated for PCI or cor­
onary artery bypass grafting, but this consideration is based upon low- 
quality evidence.395,396 No specific recommendations are available for 
the use of psychotropic drugs.395
6.6. Organization of care
Healthcare is frequently fragmented by specialties, hindering efforts to 
provide holistic care that addresses physical and mental health condi­
tions. New care models have sought to integrate physical healthcare 
into mental healthcare settings, and mental healthcare into settings fo­
cused on physical conditions.397 Novel integrated programmes using 
remote delivery of mental health interventions and promoting psycho­
logical well-being have garnered growing interest in the literature.398
Several RCTs have explored the effectiveness of collaborative care 
models in managing various health conditions. Co-ordinated or 
collaborative care of people with CVD and other conditions has been 
shown to improve CV risk factors, cardiometabolic disease control, gen­
eral function, and symptoms of depression.399–402 A systematic review 
and meta-analysis of collaborative care in primary or community health­
care settings (79 trials) reported significantly greater improvements in 
depression and anxiety in the short and long term, along with increased 
medication use, mental health components of QoL measure (SF-12, 
SF-36), and satisfaction.403 However, an RCT of a collaborative care pro­
gramme for people with HF and depression did not show significant im­
provements in clinical outcomes compared with enhanced usual care.404
An integrated adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) psychology service 
has been shown to reduce psychological distress, however, few people 
received full psychological assessment.405 A recent position paper ad­
dresses the main mental health concerns in congenital heart disease 
and advocates the generation of models for the integration of mental 
health professionals in paediatric and ACHD teams.406
Although often delivered in primary care, collaborative care models 
have also been evaluated in rehabilitation facilities,407,408 and acute care 
hospitals.409 Collaborative care has been tested in mental health clinics 
and was found to improve physical health compared with usual care 
with no differences in overall QoL. Half of the effects on functioning 
were mediated through the effects of collaborative care on depression 
severity in people with bipolar depression.410,411
Collaborative care is usually delivered by nurses supported by a 
multidisciplinary team. Further study of novel applications of collabora­
tive care and related interventions is warranted due to the potential of 
these programmes to improve management of CVD and mental health 
conditions and enable CV practices to deliver holistic care.398 In par­
ticular, new models of integrated care with multidisciplinary teams 
(Psycho-Cardio team) and experts in improving mental health are 
needed in clinical CV care. The composition and function of these 
teams should be dynamic and flexible, adapted to the needs of people 
with CVD, their caregivers, clinical scenarios, and available resources. 
6.7. Section summary points and 
management consensus statements from 
Section 6
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
Ideally, assessment of mental health status should be performed routinely within CVD clinical practice and implemented when the context of local capacity 
and capability allows.
(ii)
Depression and anxiety can easily be overlooked in the routine care of people with CVD and/or considered ‘normal’ reactions to individual clinical/ 
prognostic burden of disease.
(iii)
Clinical history can be used to identify mental health symptoms. If there is clinical suspicion, formal screening with validated tools is advised.
(iv)
Psycho-Cardio teams are needed to structure pathways for: 
• Screening.
• Referral.
• Treatment of people with CVD and suspected or established mental health conditions.
(v)
Medical interventions including pharmacotherapy may be needed for people with CVD who are diagnosed with mental health conditions, especially for 
severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD.
(vi)
In some people with CVD, combination therapy of psychological interventions plus medication may be useful.

### 7 Severe mental illness and

cardiovascular disease
7.1. Cardiovascular risk in people with 
severe mental illness
Severe mental illnesses are diseases defined by a significantly impaired 
level of psychosocial functioning and usually comprise disorders such 
as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe recurrent major 
depressive disorder6 (Figure 11). Definitions and characteristics of SMI ac­
cording to ICD (International Classification of Diseases)-11 criteria,7 can 
be found in Supplementary data online, Table S11.
Individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been 
found to live approximately 14.5 and 8–12 years less than their coun­
terparts without SMI, respectively.412,413 All-cause mortality in people 
with SMI is more than 2.5 times higher compared with the general 
population,414 and the standardized mortality gap may be increasing 
over time.415 Cardiovascular disease plays a major role in cause- 
specific mortality among people with SMI,26 and SMI increases the in­
cidence and prevalence of CVD. People with schizophrenia are at 
two- to three-fold higher risk of having CVD, particularly younger in­
dividuals.12 In a large-scale meta-analysis (3 211 768 people with SMI; 
113 383 368 controls), the pooled prevalence of CVD was 9.9% and 
the cumulative incidence of CVD was 3.6% in people with SMI (me­
dian follow-up 8.4 years), a significantly higher adjusted risk of CVD 
incidence compared with controls in longitudinal studies.12 People 
with schizophrenia have significantly higher rates of SCD, exceeding 
population rates by 11-fold.416 There is some evidence to suggest 
young adults with SMI may be at particular risk of increased CV 
events.417,418
7.2. Prognosis in severe mental illness and 
cardiovascular disease
The co-occurrence of SMI and CVD increases all-cause mortality risk 
and worsens CV prognosis. Observational studies suggest that, among 
people with SMI, the risk for CHD and CV mortality is up to 2.5 times 
higher in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder compared 
with controls, with larger effects in younger people.419 According to 
Danish national registry data, while trends in MI mortality rates declined 
over 1 and 5 years of follow-up, people with schizophrenia did not ex­
perience the same decline in mortality rate following MI in long-term 
follow-up.420 People with SMI present clinically with HF 7 years earlier 
than the general population, and men with SMI and HF have excess 
mortality compared with men with HF without SMI. ICD implantation, 
cardiac resynchronization therapy, VAD implantation, and HTx 
are used at a similar rate in people with HF with reduced ejection frac­
tion and SMI as those without SMI, but people with SMI experienced 
poorer prognosis following cardiac resynchronization therapy, VAD, 
and HTx.421
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Screening of mental health with validated screening tools is advised after a new diagnosis or CV event, at least once during follow-up and anytime based on 
clinical judgement of need.
(ii)
Initial simple screening with a two-item measure (i.e. Whooley questions, PHQ-2, GAD-2) can be incorporated into routine practice.
(iii)
A low threshold for mental health screening in people with CVD is advised, considering the high prevalence of mental health conditions in people with CVD 
and its impact on outcomes.
(iv)
Following an abnormal result in the initial screening, a longer validated screening instrument should be used to determine if condition severity is low, 
moderate, or high.
(v)
Psycho-Cardio teams must define who is responsible for the assessment of mental health conditions and how and when it will be done, tailoring it to the 
specific context and resources.
(vi)
Each Psycho-Cardio team may choose a particular screening tool after careful assessment of its validity, reliability, and applicability to their population, but 
standardized screening tools are preferred for mental health assessment.
(vii)
People scoring high on a screening questionnaire need referral for diagnostic assessment and appropriate treatment by a mental health professional.
(viii)
Applying a stepped care approach to manage mental health conditions in people with CVD is reasonable based on preferences, severity of symptoms and 
condition, and resources available.
(ix)
Developing and evaluating tailored intervention programmes aimed at alleviating distress of people coping with CVD and caregivers may be useful.
(x)
Lifestyle measures and psycho-education are useful for all people with CVD while psychological therapies may be helpful for people experiencing 
depression and/or anxiety.
(xi)
Cardiac rehabilitation is an opportunity to screen people for depression and anxiety and can contribute to improve mental health after CV events or be an 
opportunity to identify and manage mental health conditions.
(xii)
Avoiding benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in the management of anxiety and depression is advised.
(xiii)
Anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics are overused and overprescribed in the general population, especially among the elderly and people with mental 
health conditions, so careful selection of indications is advisable.
(xiv)
Antidepressant use is advised for those with moderate to severe anxiety disorders and depression under the guidance of qualified mental health 
professionals.
(xv)
The use of antidepressants in HF is only advisable in severe depression symptoms where the risk of untreated depression outweighs the risk of taking 
antidepressants.
(xvi)
In people with ventricular arrhythmias, antidepressants associated with an increased propensity to prolong QTc (such as TCAs and possibly citalopram/ 
escitalopram in dosages over 20 mg), may be switched to newer antidepressants with better safety profiles.
(xvii)
Given the frequent interactions between antidepressants and CV drugs affecting their efficacy and safety, therapeutic drug monitoring is advisable to 
optimize pharmacotherapy and minimize potential side effects and clinically relevant drug interactions.

7.3. Increased cardiovascular disease risk 
in people with severe mental illness
The aetiology of CVD in people with SMI is multifactorial, involving gen­
etic/biological, disease-specific and treatment-specific effects, lifestyle 
factors, and treatment disparities, which are mutually inter­
twined.422,423 A summary of these factors is given in Figure 12, and de­
scribed in the text below.
7.3.1. Lifestyle and biological risk factors
Risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, 
obesity, and smoking, contribute to a significantly higher CV risk in 
people with SMI.424,425 Genetic/biological, disease-specific factors in­
clude common genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia and diabetes, 
the effects of psychopathology such as negative and depressive symp­
toms leading to sedentary lifestyle.424 Schizophrenia is associated 
with more than a three-fold risk of obesity compared with the 
general population,426 and metabolic syndrome and diabetes were 
also found to be more prevalent in people with schizophrenia and bi­
polar disorder.426–429 Hypertension was found to be more prevalent 
in people with bipolar disorders, but not schizophrenia.430 Finally, 
people with schizophrenia had five times higher odds of smoking 
than the general population,431 up to 65% of people with schizophre­
nia are smokers,432,433 and they have higher rates of alcohol addic­
tion.434 People with SMI have not shown the same reduction of 
modifiable risk factors and resulting decrease in CVD mortality rates 
as the general population.419
7.3.2. Medication-induced cardiovascular risk factors
Disease-specific and medication-induced factors include side effects to 
medications, obesity, diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hypercholes­
terolaemia.427,435–438 The effect of medication is not straightforward, as 
metabolic-induced side effects may not be independent predictors for

CVD in persons with SMI.438,439 A summary of data on CV risk asso­
ciated with antipsychotic use is highlighted below: 
• Current reports do not show that antipsychotics are associated 
with increased risk of MI or stroke in people with schizophrenia 
and bipolar disorder compared with placebo,440 despite previous 
meta-analyses.12,441
• The use of long-acting antipsychotic medication and second- 
generation antipsychotics were found protective against all-cause 
mortality compared with no antipsychotic use. The largest effects 
were seen for second-generation long-acting injectable antipsycho­
tics, clozapine, any long-acting injectable antipsychotics, and any 
second-generation antipsychotics.26 In a Finnish nationwide data­
base study (median follow-up 14.1 years), CV mortality was significant­
ly lower among patients with schizophrenia on any antipsychotic 
treatment compared with non-use. Several antipsychotics were asso­
ciated with a significantly reduced CV death risk compared with 
non-use (long-acting injectable olanzapine and oral flupentixol) and 
the use of clozapine reduced all-cause mortality by 61% and CV death 
risk by 45% compared with non-use of antipsychotics.442 Findings were 
possibly explained by improved adherence to antipsychotics of people 
with SMI, as this has been associated with decreased discontinuation 
risk of antidiabetics, statins, antihypertensives, and beta-blockers in 
people with schizophrenia.443 The use of medication appears not to 
influence the cardiorespiratory fitness level of people with SMI receiv­
ing treatment.444
Antipsychotics vary in their propensity to induce modifiable CVD 
risk factors. Most second-generation antipsychotics with wide receptor 
activity profiles (serotonin 5-HT2A, histamine H1, muscarinic M3), such 
as olanzapine, clozapine, and quetiapine, are associated with increased 
risk of weight gain and consequent metabolic syndrome, weight gain- 
related diabetes, and hypertriglyceridaemia.437
According to a 
meta-analysis of RCTs, olanzapine, clozapine, zotepine, sertindole,

iloperidone, and quetiapine were found to be associated with worse 
metabolic profiles (weight gain, glucose increase, hypertriglyceridaemia, 
hypercholesterolaemia, and decrease of high-density lipoprotein chol­
esterol) in short-term use.435 Zotepine, olanzapine, sertindole, caripra­
zine, iloperidone, quetiapine, clozapine, and risperidone have been 
associated with the greatest weight gain (up to 3 kg), but nearly half 
of antipsychotics caused significantly more weight gain than pla­
cebo.445,446 A summary of effects of antipsychotics on CVD modifiable 
risk factors is presented in Table 6.
7.3.3. Assessing cardiovascular disease risk
Widely used tools for CV risk assessment in the general population usu­
ally underestimate the risk of CVD in the population with SMI.447
Significant differences in risk prediction screening tools such as metabolic 
syndrome concept, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) mod­
el and two PRedIction and Management of cardiovascular Risk in 
peOple with SEvere mental illnesses (PRIMROSE) models, carry the 
risk of significant disparities in treatment initiation in people with 
SMI.447 Moreover, these models generally underestimate CV risk in 
adolescents with SMI.447,448 Finally, there is no consensus of which 
healthcare professionals should screen and monitor for CVD in SMI. 
While screening is usually in the domain of primary care, persons 
with SMI have overall low use of health services, therefore, 
mental health professionals may need to take the lead for screening,21
diagnostics,22,23 and treatment.21,24–26
Several practice Guidelines for the screening and monitoring of CV 
risk in people with schizophrenia are proposed but have been scarcely 
implemented. Position statements by the European Psychiatric 
Association, supported by the European Association for the Study of 
Diabetes (EASD), and the ESC have made recommendations for 
screening.449 We highlight the following as particularly important for 
people with SMI and CVD: 
• Routine screening for CVD risk factors should be performed by psy­
chiatrists and general practitioners at all stages of the disorder, re­
gardless of age, with initial risk assessment carried out during the 
first visit and before the prescription of antipsychotics. Baseline risk 
assessment includes: 
⚬Personal and family history of CVD or diabetes or related disease.
⚬Lifestyle patterns: smoking and alcohol consumption, healthy diet, 
physical activity.
⚬Weight, height, waist circumference, calculation of body mass 
index.
⚬Fasting blood glucose and lipids (total cholesterol, low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
triglycerides).
⚬Blood pressure, heart rate.
• All individuals with SMI taking antipsychotics should be actively mon­
itored for modifiable risk factors at baseline, after 12 weeks, and at 
least annually thereafter.
• People who have CV risk factors should be monitored at the start of 
a new treatment and re-assessed 6 and 12 weeks after initiation of a 
new antipsychotic drug, and periodically, depending on the presence 
of risk factors.449 In people with diabetes, monitoring should include 
glycated haemoglobin every 12 weeks.
• After initiation of antipsychotics known to induce CV side effects [e.g. 
prolongation of QTc interval or tachycardia (see Section 7.6.1)], elec­
trocardiogram (ECG) is advised at baseline, after 1 week, and after 6 
and 12 weeks, and annually thereafter.

7.4. Gaps and disparities in the 
management of cardiovascular disease in 
people with severe mental illness
The presence of SMI in itself does not explain the lifespan 
inequalities observed.450 Multiple factors have been identified including 
systemic barriers to prevention,310 screening,21 diagnosis,22,23 and 
treatment.21,24–26 Collectively, these lead to large healthcare disparities 
for people with SMI. Key studies confirm these inequalities persist in 
CVD.451–454 To overcome these barriers healthcare professionals 
need to be aware of, and address, system-level problems including stig­
ma, stereotypes, prejudice, and diagnostic overshadowing (defined as 
the misattribution of physical symptoms to pre-existing psychological 
illnesses).455
7.4.1. Autonomy, communication, and informed 
consent
Communication between the CV team and people with SMI and CVD 
should follow similar principles as for people with CVD without SMI 
outlined in Section 6.3. For people with SMI, this may require a move 
away from the established ‘best interest’ approach (healthcare profes­
sionals know what is best), to a ‘will and preference’ approach which 
prioritizes goals and values.456 This shift is particularly critical for people 
with SMI and CVD, who may experience heightened stigma or bias that 
can lead to paternalistic treatment. Respecting their will and preference 
not only affirms their human right to self-determination and dignity, but 
also allows them greater control over their care, promoting a sense of 
ownership in managing their health. The Psycho-Cardio team should 
develop a more proactive and person-centred approach in caring for 
persons with SMI including: 
• Educating the people about their illness, warning signs, treatment, and 
management plan.
• Including people with SMI and family/caregivers in the management 
plan using SDM.
• Engaging people with SMI to participate in their care actively by in­
cluding them in all forms of treatment (lifestyle modification pro­
grammes, smoking cessation).
• Encouraging people with SMI to check up regularly for CVD risks and 
CV symptoms.
• Monitoring adherence to medication.
• Reassuring and signposting to practical information or resources.
• Asking if there is someone the person with SMI would like you to 
contact.
People with SMI are presumed to have capacity to consent to treat­
ment unless there is reason to believe this is not the case. In those rare 
situations, a decision-making capacity assessment may be required, and 
this should be undertaken by the professionals involved in delivering the 
physical health intervention being proposed. Depending on jurisdiction, 
people with SMI may have appointed a decision-maker themselves or 
may have an advanced healthcare directive, so it is important to be 
aware of these issues and determine a person’s capacity to consent 
to treatment before proceeding.
If the person with SMI already has a legal guardian, they have the legal 
authority to sign medical informed consent, but different acts may be 
applied in different countries. People with SMI may have reduced ability 
to participate in the treatment processes due to the nature of SMI lead­
ing to unintentional non-adherence. In severe active psychosis, the indi­
vidual may not be able to communicate CV symptoms or may not be 
able to tolerate invasive investigations and/or therapies because of psy­
chiatric symptoms.
Many people with SMI may become suitable for an invasive strategy and 
be clinically assessed for CV interventions. This may require an advocating 
and assertive approach by the management team, and close collaboration 
with liaising mental health professionals and general practitioners. The 
management of CAD in people with SMI should be discussed by the 
Psycho-Cardio team (Figure 3), with input from a psychiatrist. Many defi­
ciencies in the management of CAD in people with SMI occur for obvious 
and at times insurmountable reasons. Consensus and collaboration 
among people with SMI, families, general practitioners/family physicians, 
CV specialists, and mental health professionals is essential for good prac­
tice. General practitioners play a particularly relevant role in reviewing and 
optimizing the physical and mental health of people with SMI and CVD, 
being responsible for the integral process of care and co-ordinating 
care by the different specialists involved.
In the care of SMI, flexible assertive community treatment models 
usually ensure better availability of health services for persons with 
SMI and prominent psychiatric symptoms, but there is a lack of studies 
analysing the effects of these models in people with CVD.457,458
Interactive telemedicine (therapy delivered via video conferencing) 
was found comparable to in-person delivery in effectiveness, accept­
ability, and cost in people with various mental health and substance 
abuse issues.459
7.5. Management of cardiovascular disease 
in people with severe mental illness
7.5.1. Management of modifiable risk factors
Management of modifiable risk factors in people with SMI follow the 
same principles as in people without SMI, such as education, behaviour­
al counselling, lifestyle interventions, and peer and family support inter­
ventions. Increased efficacy of interventions directed to improve CV 
risk in people with SMI is associated with: 
• High intensity and high co-ordination.
• Inclusion of both behavioural and pharmacological management, fol­
lowing a multimorbidity approach.
Few studies, however, have evaluated interventions addressing one 
or more CVD risk factors in people with SMI.
7.5.2. Diet, physical activity, and body weight control
The diet of people with schizophrenia is often unhealthy, characterized 
as being poor in fibre and fruit, and rich in saturated fats with a high cal­
oric intake.460 People with SMI are generally less physically active than 
the general population, performing significantly lower volumes of mod­
erate to vigorous activity per day according to a meta-analysis of 69 
studies.424 Currently available studies in people with SMI indicate a 
beneficial effect of exercise and diet on CV risk, with interventions in­
creasing weekly activity compared with no intervention.461 Significant 
improvements in fitness, psychiatric symptoms, and overall functioning 
were found in participants who attended 50% of physical activity ses­
sions.462 The European Psychiatric Association (EPA) suggests that


<!-- PAGE 37 -->

### Page 37

physical activity should be regularly offered to people with SMI as a low 
risk and accessible way of improving health.463
In general, weight loss should be advised to people with SMI who 
have a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 or a waist circumference ≥88 cm 
in women or ≥102 cm in men.449 The effectiveness of behavioural or 
integrative interventions to improve CV risk in people with SMI has 
had mixed results.422 Two of four studies reported a decrease in CV 
risk in the integrated care intervention group compared with control 
groups, however, two studies reported no difference.464–467
Glucose and lipid-related laboratory results were mainly reported as 
secondary outcome assessments in studies of weight management in­
terventions. Metformin is the currently accepted first-line treatment 
of antipsychotic-associated weight gain, although not all people bene­
fit.468 In 2020, the ESC in collaboration with the EASD updated their 
treatment algorithms to recommend the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonists and sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors as 
alternate therapy options to metformin based on CV and renal co­
morbidities independent of glycaemic control. However, there are still 
no data to support their use for antipsychotic-associated weight gain 
and diabetes.469 In a meta-analysis of 33 RCTs (3473 people with 
SMI), weight control was improved with behavioural interventions 
compared with control, metformin, anticonvulsive medications topira­
mate and zonisamide, and adjunctive or antipsychotic switching to ari­
piprazole (meta-analysis not possible). Evidence was insufficient for all 
other interventions and for effects on glucose and lipid control.470
7.5.3. Smoking cessation
Smoking cessation strategies for persons with SMI are similar to the gen­
eral population as summarized previously (Section 6.3.10), including ap­
propriate pharmacological therapy in combination with behavioural 
therapy. Brief behavioural interventions (motivational enhancement, per­
sonalized feedback) have increased rates of pursuing nicotine 
dependence treatment compared with psycho-education in people 
with schizophrenia.471 Studies have confirmed the safety and efficacy 
of first-line smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, including varenicline, 
bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy, and nicotine patch monother­
apy in individuals with and without schizophrenia or schizoaffective dis­
orders.384,472–474 Although studies do not indicate a serious safety 
signal with varenicline or bupropion, there is a general risk of deterio­
rated mental health in association with smoking cessation due to nicotine 
abstinence. People with previous mental health issues should be well in­
formed and followed up carefully during smoking cessation interventions.
Maintenance of pharmacotherapeutic and behavioural treatment has 
been reported to significantly reduce relapse rates among smokers with 
schizophrenia.471 Smoking cessation has a double benefit effect as it also 
potentially enables the need for a lower dose of antipsychotic treatment. 
Specifically, smoking can influence the efficacy of multiple medications used 
in the treatment of SMI through CYP1A2 induction, reducing plasma levels 
of some drugs (Supplementary data online, Table S10). Therefore, smoking 
cessation may lead to increased plasma levels of these drugs (e.g. clozapine) 
and thus doses of medications may need to be reduced when someone 
stops smoking, in consultation with psychiatrist.
7.5.4. Pharmacological management
Psychiatric medication in people with SMI is prescribed long term with a 
variety of psychotropic medications, depending largely on the state of 
the disease and comorbidities. People with schizophrenia, other psych­
otic disorders, and bipolar disorders are treated with antipsychotics, 
sometimes in combination with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, 
and frequently anxiolytics or sedatives. The same is true for severe re­
current depression, where antipsychotics are added to antidepressants. 
CYP450 pharmacokinetic profiles of psychotropic medications can be 
found in Supplementary data online, Table S10.
While pharmacologic treatment in SMI is associated with decreased 
risk of CVD compared with no treatment, a rational pharmacotherapy 
is needed as some medications are associated with CV risks. As dis­
cussed in Section 7.6 these include the development of CV side effects 
via receptor blockade of muscarinic receptors and adrenergic recep­
tors and worsening modifiable CV risk factors.475
Rational pharmacotherapy for persons with SMI takes a multifactor­
ial approach as outlined in the principles below: 
• Use of monotherapy whenever possible.
• Use of medication with lower propensity to induce or worsen CV risk.
• Addition of medication to prevent CV risk factors (e.g. metformin or 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to prevent weight gain).
• Consideration of possible drug interactions and monitoring for CV 
side effects upon initiation of a new drug.
• Ensuring adequate adherence to psychiatric medication.
People with SMI respond to the same strategies to increase adher­
ence as those without SMI, including simplifying medication regimens 
and use of behavioural interventions. Text message reminders, phone 
calls, electronic pill counters, and training family members can improve 
medication adherence in SMI populations.422
7.6. Management of cardiovascular 
conditions in people with severe mental 
illness
Managing CVD in people with SMI requires good communication and 
collaboration between mental health and CV specialists. Several factors 
that may help improve CVD management and secondary prevention in 
those with CV conditions are listed below and summarized in Figure 13. 
• Raise awareness of specialists and primary care professionals regard­
ing the importance of controlling CV risk factors.
• Promote adherence to psychotropic drugs; long-acting injectables 
may help.
• Decrease the number of psychotropic drugs if possible.
• Switch to drugs with less propensity to induce metabolic syndrome, 
in consultation with psychiatrists and evaluation of relapse risk.476
• Reinforce lifestyle modifications and prescribe CV prevention medi­
cations as needed.
• Addition of varenicline/bupropion or other forms of nicotine re­
placement therapy combined with smoking cessation programmes 
in case of smoking.
7.6.1. Rhythm disturbances
People with SMI are at increased risk of developing supraventricular and 
ventricular arrhythmias, which may eventually lead to SCD. This in­
creased arrhythmia risk is multifactorial, including distress resulting 
from the SMI, high prevalence of risk factors and unhealthy lifestyles, 
CV comorbidities commonly observed in SMI, and side effects of psy­
chotropic medications. Furthermore, autonomic dysfunction, chronic 
inflammation, and oxidative stress are common in SMI and have been 
associated with an increased arrhythmia risk.423
• Pre-existing arrhythmias or their development after the initiation of 
treatment can pose significant challenges to the medical management

of SMI. The risk of SCD is significantly increased in people with SMI 
with estimates suggesting a two- to four-fold higher risk compared 
with the general population.298 Several medications prescribed to 
persons with SMI have potential pro-arrhythmic side effects and 
may cause or exacerbate atrial and ventricular tachycardia. Caution 
and careful monitoring are needed when prescribing potentially 
pro-arrhythmic drugs in people with known heart disease, with 
the following considerations: quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, ilo­
peridone, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and sertindole increase the risk of 
QTc prolongation compared with placebo.477
• Iloperidone, chlorpromazine, loxapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and pa­
liperidone increase the risk of tachycardia compared with placebo.478
• Low-potency first-generation antipsychotics and multi-acting 
receptor-targeted second-generation antipsychotic treatment (spe­
cifically clozapine, chlorpromazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risper­
idone) are associated with an increased risk of AF especially in those 
with hypertension, diabetes, or CAD although evidence is limited.479
• Lithium may induce electrocardiographic changes and arrhythmias 
such as T-wave inversions, sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, PR pro­
longation, incomplete bundle branch block, QTc prolongation, in­
creased QT dispersion, the Brugada electrocardiographic pattern, 
and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.480
The risk of AF appears not to be generally increased among people 
with SMI after adjustment for sex and age, although this may reflect un­
derdiagnosis of AF and misinterpretation of palpitation symp­
toms.423,479,481 In a study from Korea, young adults (20–39 years) 
diagnosed with mental disorder had a higher risk of incident AF (ad­
justed HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.44–1.62).482
7.6.1.1. QTc interval prolongation
QTc intervals can be prolonged in association with several antipsychot­
ic drugs such as sertindole, amisulpride, ziprasidone, iloperidone, risper­
idone, olanzapine, and quetiapine.477 This effect may be more common 
in women than men due to differences in pharmacokinetic profiles.483
A prolongation of the QTc interval increases the risk of torsades de 
pointes tachycardias and SCD. Therefore, a 12-lead ECG should be re­
corded before and after initiation of antipsychotic drugs and further 
ECG controls performed on a yearly basis during long-term follow-up.
Prolonged QTc in response to antipsychotic medication may indicate 
acquired long QT syndrome and/or reveal an underlying genetic predis­
position. Diagnosis and management of long QT syndrome in SMI 
should follow general Guidelines.484
• Acquired long QT syndrome is usually defined by a QTc of >500 ms 
or a drug-induced change from baseline >60–70 ms.485
• In people with QTc intervals >500 ms, suspected causal drugs should 
be stopped and switched to alternative medication with lower 
QT-prolonging properties and be evaluated by a cardiologist for 
underlying genetic conditions.
• In cases of intermediate QTc prolongation (e.g. ≥470 ms in men; 
≥480 ms in women), dose reduction or switching to a different 
antipsychotic may be considered and repeated ECGs should be 
documented. Individualized risk-benefit assessments are useful, con­
sidering the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation, 
symptoms, and the QT-prolonging potential of the prescribed 
medication.
• Given that QT-prolonging effects are dose dependent, always aim for 
the lowest effective dose. Interactions with other QT-prolonging 
drugs like amiodarone, sotalol, or erythromycin should be avoided.
• The inherent risk of QT prolongation associated with specific drugs is 
provided on the CredibleMeds website.486
• QT prolongation may also be the effect of other reversible causes 
such as hypokalaemia, hypothyroidism, or bradycardia.
• Sinus tachycardia is common in SMI, heart rate correction of the QT 
interval with the Fridericia formula is optimal, rather than Bazett’s 
formula which overestimates QT at higher heart rates.487
• The measurement of QT intervals can be complicated by abnormal 
T-wave morphology requiring expert consultation for correct 
interpretation.477,483
7.6.1.2. Heart rate changes
Both tachycardia and bradycardia are side effects of antipsychotic medi­
cation.478 Sinus tachycardia has been reported with most antipsychotic 
medications, including first- and second-generation therapies. It is most 
common with clozapine (17%–33%),488 but has usually a transient and 
benign course. However, possible medical causes of sinus tachycardia 
should be excluded. In those with symptoms, rate control with cardio- 
selective beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or ivabradine may be 
used. Persistent heart rates above 130 beats per minute (b.p.m) may in 
rare cases cause a tachycardiomyopathy, which is usually reversible by 
improved rate control.
Bradycardia is a rare side effect of antipsychotics, with incidence not 
significantly higher compared with controls.478 Bradycardia warrants 
careful clinical attention in people at risk, e.g. in those with pre-existing 
conduction disturbances or symptoms like dizziness or syncope.
Lithium has a unique mechanism of action and a narrow therapeutic 
window. Common side effects include sinus node dysfunction, bradycar­
dia, conduction delays (e.g. atrioventricular block, bundle branch block) 
but also precordial T-wave changes including Brugada pattern, and QT 
prolongation. Prolonged use and high blood levels increase the complica­
tion risk making maintenance of optimal lithium serum levels essential.480
Since lithium concentration is affected by sodium, conditions like dehy­
dration or renal failure must be managed carefully. However, with appro­
priate monitoring, lithium does not pose a significant CV risk.478,480
In summary, in people with SMI and arrhythmias, it is necessary to 
evaluate the link between arrhythmias and antipsychotics. If clinically 
suspected, switching to other drugs with less propensity to cause 
changes in heart rhythm may be appropriate, however, this must be ba­
lanced against the risk of SMI relapse. Clozapine, as the only medication 
indicated in people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, is often 
hard to switch due to a high risk of relapse. A decision algorithm is given 
in Figure 14 and additional information is provided in Table 7.
7.6.2. Clozapine-induced myocarditis
Although clozapine has been associated with an increased risk of develop­
ing myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, reviews and meta-analyses show that 
event rates and death rates are low. Results are limited by inconsistency in 
the diagnostic criteria for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy.489 The odds of 
clozapine-induced myocarditis increased with concurrent sodium valpro­
ate use, and possibly increasing age and higher clozapine dose.490
If clozapine-induced myocarditis or cardiomyopathy is suspected, 
treatment should be discontinued promptly and referred urgently to 
a cardiologist for diagnostic evaluation.491 People who have persistent 
tachycardia at rest, especially during the first 2 months of treatment, 
should be closely observed for other signs or symptoms of myocarditis 
or cardiomyopathy (palpitations, arrhythmias, symptoms mimicking MI, 
chest pain, and other unexplained symptoms of HF). However, special­
ist advice and link with psychiatrists is needed to prevent inappropriate 
discontinuation of clozapine.

7.7. Interventions to improve the 
management of people with severe mental 
illness and cardiovascular disease
Existing programmes of prevention, early detection, and treatment of 
CVD have not consistently and significantly improved the CV risk profile 
in people with schizophrenia and other SMI conditions.492 Poor motiv­
ation, lack of insight and cognitive impairment, and limited participation 
in decision-making by persons with SMI may be contributing to non- 
adherence to prevention, diagnostic, and treatment programmes. 
Cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment programmes need to 
work with mental health experts to provide CVD screening and care 
that is accessible and appropriate for people with SMI.

Table 7 Management of psychotropic drugs with QT interval prolongation properties
Action
Supporting information
Assess symptoms
Typically, asymptomatic 
In case of torsades de pointes: palpitations, dizziness, syncope, cardiac arrest.
Diagnostic 
work-up
• 12-lead ECG providing QTc at baseline and after 1, 6, and 12 weeks after initiating drug
• ECG more often in case of QT prolongation
• Use Fridericia formula for heart rate correction if there is tachycardia
• Check electrolytes: potassium, calcium, magnesium
• Ambulatory ECG monitoring in people with symptoms
• Exclude possible inherited long QT syndrome.
Management
Special caution with: sertindole, amisulpride, ziprasidone, iloperidone, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine 
• Always aim for the lowest effective dose
• Check for other QT-prolonging drugs
• Check for drug interactions
• Always special caution when new medication is started
• Consult https://www.crediblemeds.org/ for specific information on QT-prolonging drug effects
• Correct electrolyte imbalances
• Address other reversible QT-prolonging factors (e.g. bradycardia, hypothyroidism, starvation/eating disorders, alcohol and substance 
abuse, myocardial ischaemia)
Note other non-reversible potentially QT-prolonging factors: heart failure, ventricular hypertrophy, recent conversion from atrial 
fibrillation, impaired hepatic/renal function, female sex, age over 65 years 
If QTc is prolonged (>470 ms) at baseline, treatment initiation is generally not recommended and should be carefully considered based 
on individualized risk-benefit assessment (Psycho-Cardio team)a.
Special 
precautions
Stop treatment with antipsychotic drug (and any other potentially QT-prolonging medication) if: 
• QTc >500 msb
• Increase in QTc >60–70 ms from baselinec.
© ESC 2025
ECG, electrocardiogram; QTc, corrected QT interval.
aQTc prolongation (>470 ms) during treatment warrants repeated ECG documentation and thorough evaluation of symptoms and additional risk factors for QT prolongation. Dose 
reduction or switching to a different antipsychotic drug may be considered in selected cases after individualized risk-benefit assessment (Psycho-Cardio team).
bRequest urgent consultation with Psycho-Cardio team/cardiologist.
cRequest urgent consultation with Psycho-Cardio team/cardiologist, repeat ECG.
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
The presence of SMI increases CV risk, especially in younger people.
(ii)
Regular CV risk assessment is essential in people with SMI regardless 
of age, to prevent the development or progression of CVD, ideally 
Continued before the prescription of antipsychotics and, afterwards, periodically 
in all stages of illness.
(iii)
Management of CVD in people with SMI aims to reduce modifiable 
CV risk factors, including weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, 
dyslipidaemia, smoking, unhealthy diet, and sedentary lifestyle  
habits.
(iv)
CVD management in people with SMI benefits from optimizing SMI 
pharmacotherapy: (i) preferring monotherapy, (ii) using 
medications less likely to induce weight gain or other CV risks, (iii) 
monitoring for possible drug interactions and side effects, and (iv) 
ensuring medication adherence.
(v)
Efforts to alleviate the impact of psychosocial and stress-related 
factors are needed in people with SMI.
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Addressing stigma and managing CVD in people with SMI in 
accordance with CV Guidelines and best clinical practice is a 
responsibility of all healthcare professionals.
(ii)
CV care for people with SMI can be improved by following a holistic 
person-centred approach, involving close collaboration between the 
Psycho-Cardio team with psychiatrists, general practitioners, and 
sometimes other specialists to proactively facilitate the engagement of 
people with SMI in such programmes.

### 8 Mental health in specific

populations and situations
8.1. Sex and gender differences in mental 
health and cardiovascular disease
Biological (‘sex’) and sociocultural (‘gender’) aspects may explain differ­
ences or disparities between women and men in incidence, prevalence, 
presentation, diagnosis, management, and response to treatment in CV 
and mental health conditions (Figure 15). Sex reflects biological factors 
like genetics, anatomy, physiology, and hormones, while gender involves 
socially constructed norms shaping roles, relationships, and power dy­
namics. Gender interacts with sex, affecting traits that define women, 
men, and intersex individuals. Pregnancy and menopause are clear ex­
amples of the differential influence of sex and gender in CV and mental 
well-being. Multiple studies and analyses have shown that: 
• Depression and anxiety are twice as prevalent in women, have increased 
more in women over the past two decades compared with men, and 
are important risk factors for ACS and CV mortality.94,493–495
• Risk ratio for psychosocial factors is higher in women with CVD com­
pared with men with CVD (RR 25.7 vs 21.7, respectively).56,496
• The association between depression or anxiety and CVD risk is 
stronger in young and middle-aged women compared with men.94,497
• Women experience a greater impact from chronic self-perceived 
stress and marital stress, whilst men are more affected by job-related 
stress.498
However, this has to be interpreted in the context of the following 
factors: (i) prevailing social norms may lead to underreporting of mental 
stress in men,499,500 and (ii) men may have better perceived health 
and less anxiety than women, despite reporting more health risk 
behaviours.501
Sex differences in stress response have been seen in animal and hu­
man models.502,503 Although pre-clinical studies in rodents and neuro­
biological studies in the past have predominantly been done in males, 
evidence of sex differences in neurobiological alterations in people 
with depression and anxiety is mounting.504–507 These are associated 
with genetic differences, inflammation, platelet activation, sympathetic 
function, and hormone-related receptor signalling pathways.

Some SES factors like educational level and sex-specific life events 
(i.e. pregnancy, sexual abuse, intimate partner violence), have a different 
impact on the stress response in women and men. Women have a high­
er inflammatory response to stress compared with men, which is asso­
ciated with future adverse CV outcomes in people with IHD.508 The 
association between menopause transition and depression remains 
contentious, although severe vasomotor symptoms are recognized as 
a contributing factor associated with depression.509,510 Hormonal 
changes during menopause transition frequently induce mood distur­
bances, adversely impacting QoL and work performance.511,512
During peri-menopause but not in post-menopause, temporary hor­
mone therapy may alleviate these symptoms.511,512
In men, erectile dysfunction has not only been shown to be a conse­
quence of CVD, it is also a risk marker for future CVD.513 A recent 
meta-analysis demonstrated that sexual dysfunction is also a predictor 
of future CVD in women.514
8.1.1. Cardiovascular disease and mental health 
conditions in transgender individuals
Transgender individuals show a significantly higher risk for mental 
health conditions, including suicidality, social disintegration, and margin­
alization, compared with non-transgender individuals.515 High rates of 
discrimination and low levels of social support predispose to addictive 
behaviours in transgender persons,516 but insufficient data are available 
to differentiate between transgender subgroups. Gender-affirming 
therapy, including sex hormones, aligns individuals with their gender 
identity, enhancing QoL.517 The psychosocial benefits of hormone 
therapy with an improved body image may result in healthier lifestyle 
choices. Evidence in the ageing transgender population suggests that 
both transgender men and women face a 40% higher risk of CVD com­
pared with cisgender peers of the same birth sex.518–521 The hypercoa­
gulable effect of exogenous sex hormones, alongside the increase in 
traditional CVD risk factors, may mediate this elevated risk.
8.1.2. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
people with obstructive coronary artery disease
The impact of a life event like a diagnosis of CVD on mental stress af­
fects all genders. However, long-term population studies evaluating 
their influence according to sex and gender are scarce. Negative stress 
leads more often to adverse lifestyle behaviours and substance use in 
men, whereas sociocultural inequalities, household problems, and 
ACEs more often negatively affect women with CVD.522 Countries 
with the highest levels of gender equity have reported some of the 
greatest reductions in 40 year CVD mortality rates.496,523
The negative impact of depression on obstructive CAD in women is 
relatively more severe in younger women (<55 years) than at older 
ages.510,524 Moreover, feminine gender roles, lower educational level, 
and distress-related psychological factors such as anxiety are important 
determinants of outcomes after ACS in both sexes.525 Meta-analyses of 
negative psychological factors on obstructive CAD found no significant 
differences among men and women.106,526 In clinical practice, however, 
sex and gender differences in heart–brain interactions importantly con­
tribute to different manifestations of stable and unstable IHD.507,527
8.1.3. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
ischaemia/angina with non-obstructive coronary 
arteries and coronary vasomotor disorders
Psychological risk factors, including depression and anxiety are preva­
lent among women with myocardial ischaemia or angina with non- 
obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA/ANOCA).56 Mental stress trig­
gers endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.528–531 While some 
studies associate anxiety with INOCA/ANOCA, others found no link 
between depression or general anxiety and these conditions.532,533
Mental stress-induced ischaemia, more prevalent in women than 
men, correlates with adverse CV outcomes.534,535 This may be asso­
ciated with worse long-term prognosis, particularly in women.536,537
The influence of mental stress on INOCA/ANOCA contributes to 
their underdiagnosis and undertreatment in women.538
Young women with a history of ACS have a two-fold higher likeli­
hood of developing mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia com­
pared with men.535 Chronic mental stress is a significant trigger for 
spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), which is nine times 
more common in women.539–541 Emotional stressors are reported 
twice as frequently prior to SCAD-ACS as by other ACS cohorts.542,543
Since most people experiencing SCAD are relatively young (40–60 
years), rehabilitation should prioritize stress management, addressing 
work-life balance, and other present stressors. Psychological counsel­
ling may be needed in selected people.
8.1.4. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
people with takotsubo syndrome
Acute stress-induced takotsubo syndrome (TTS) occurs eight–nine times 
more frequently in women than in men, likely due to different coping 
strategies for stress.544 Women over 55 years of age are five times 
more likely to develop TTS compared with younger women, as risk is 
linked to increased sympathetic tone after menopause.545,546 While phys­
ical stressors more often affect men, women are more likely to experience 
an emotional trigger.547,548 These different triggers suggest two categories 
of TTS:549 primary TTS, affecting women after emotional stress with lim­
ited left ventricular dysfunction, and TTS triggered by physical stress, 
which causes more severe left ventricular dysfunction and a worse prog­
nosis. The latter seems to affect women and men equally. A direct connec­
tion between the brain and the heart associated with autonomic functions 
and regulation of the limbic system has been identified.550 Mental health 
conditions are common in people with TTS, indicating that combined psy­
chotherapy and ECR could improve mental health and reduce negative 
thinking more effectively than ECR alone.350 People with pre-admission 
psychiatric disorders are at a higher risk of recurrent TTS.551 The use 
of SSRIs may help prevent recurrence in selected individuals.551
8.1.5. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
people with heart failure
Women are underrepresented in most HF trials, leading to a lack of 
sex- and gender-specific data on the impact of mental health conditions. 
HF prevalence varies between the sexes: men typically present with HF 
with reduced ejection fraction following ACS, while women more often 
experience HF with preserved ejection fraction due to hypertension, 
obesity, and ageing.552 Sexual dimorphism is also evident in the expres­
sion of hereditary cardiomyopathies and risk factors like breast cancer, 
and the potential treatment-induced cardiomyopathy. Additionally, 
there are sex-specific disorders such as peri-partum cardiomyopathy.
Psychological stress has received limited attention as a potential dis­
ease modifier in HF. As HF with preserved ejection fraction often re­
mains undiagnosed, this contributes additional stress on the affected 
predominantly female population. However, qualitative studies support 
the assertion of non-diagnosis burden.553,554 The progressive course of 
HF, with increasing functional limitations, further increases stress in 
both males and females.
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               43

Higher psychological stress and anxiety worsen HF out­
comes.215,216,555,556 Women with HF, former smokers, those with low­
er income, and people with obesity report higher perceived stress, as 
do people with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II HF, com­
pared with asymptomatic NYHA class I HF.215,557 Social determinants 
of health influence HF prevalence, with the highest rates of HF and re­
lated readmissions observed in the most economically disadvantaged 
communities with more representation of women and individuals 
from ethnically diverse backgrounds.558
8.1.6. Sex and gender differences in mental health in 
people with arrhythmias
In people with AF, anxiety levels are significantly higher in women com­
pared with men, potentially due to older age, living alone (e.g. divorced/ 
widowed), or comorbid conditions.559 Chronic AF increases anxiety, 
depression, and affects QoL in both genders, but the effect is more pro­
nounced in women.560 Depression is more common in women with 
chronic AF,561 and affects the subjective burden of symptoms, suggest­
ing that addressing psychological comorbidities may improve symptom 
management and HRQoL. Anxiety is an important trigger for AF recur­
rence after cardioversion and ablation therapy.562
Women report higher levels of anxiety (general and ICD-related), 
and higher levels of body image concerns than men when having an 
ICD.563 They also express worries about damaging the ICD during 
breast cancer screening, which in addition may compromise the quality 
of mammography images.564
In a prospective observational study of OHCA survivors, females re­
ported significantly higher symptoms of anxiety and PTSD compared 
with men, with younger women showing the highest symptom severity. 
No sex differences were observed for depression.178 In a cohort of 249 
people with ICD,565 most had relatively low distress scores at baseline 
(mean anxiety 4.23 ± 4.47; mean depression 5.60 ± 4.73). However, 
those who received a shock showed a worsening of PTSD symptom se­
verity scores at 3 months (11%), 6 months (7%), and 12 months (7%).
8.1.7. Mental health conditions associated with 
peri-partum cardiomyopathy
Peri-partum cardiomyopathy is a serious condition with significant con­
sequences for both mother and child, causing substantial psychological 
and social stress. Mental health conditions, including peri-natal psychi­
atric illness such as major depression, panic disorder, and PTSD, can 
worsen prognosis. Screening, diagnosis, and multidisciplinary manage­
ment of peri-partum cardiomyopathy-associated mental conditions 
are described in a recent dedicated ESC Heart Failure Association sci­
entific statement.566
8.2. Mental and cardiovascular health in 
older adults
Countries across the globe are experiencing an exponential rise in the 
proportion of older persons (often defined as aged 60 years or more) in 
their population, such that the WHO predicts the number of people 
aged 80 years or older will triple between 2020 and 2050.567 With age­
ing populations comes a growing burden of chronic condition manage­
ment due in part to ‘inflammageing’, whereby chronically raised blood 
inflammatory markers increase the risk of morbidity, disability, frailty, 
and early mortality.568,569 According to the Global Burden of Disease 
programme, both CVD and mental health disorders are on the 
rise.570,571 In older adults, the prevalence of depression (19.2%), anxiety 
(16.5%), and stress (13.9%) are already relatively high.572 However, 
specific mental health disorders like late-life depression are set to in­
crease,573 which has implications for CVD management. A recent sys­
tematic review and meta-analysis of 61 prospective cohort studies 
(198 589 older adults) found that late-life depression is associated 
with increased risk of CV mortality (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20–1.43).574
Whilst there is reasonable population-level data on individual condi­
tions, the rates of mental health disorders within older adults with any 
type CVD and vice versa are not well known. Using HF as an exemplar, 
which is mostly a disease of older adults, it would seem that the global 
co-occurrence of CVD with mental disorders like depression is signifi­
cant. One of the largest meta-analyses to date (149 studies, n = 305  
407, mean age 65.2 ± 7.1 years) determined that the prevalence of 
any severity depression in HF was 41.9%, and severe depression was 
28.1%.575 In older adults with AF, a meta-analysis of 26 studies deter­
mined the rate of depression as 40.3% and anxiety as 33.6%.576 Such 
results suggest that the rates of depression may be significantly higher 
in older adults with co-existing CVD, compared with the previously de­
scribed population norms for older adults (19.2% depression, 16.5% 
anxiety).572
Non-pharmacological therapies: given that suboptimal mental 
and CV health are common in older adults, it is necessary to develop 
interventions that work synergistically to improve outcomes in both 
conditions. Unfortunately, very few interventions have been trialled 
and thus clinical practice evidence is limited. One narrative review of in­
tegrated physical-mental healthcare services for older people living with 
mental health diagnoses (9 studies, n = 1728) determined that such in­
terventions improved a range of health outcomes, however, studies 
were not large nor robust.577 The majority of RCTs included in the 
Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of psychological inter­
ventions discussed in Section 6, included older adults with comorbid 
CVD and mental disorders based on sample age (14 of 21 trials included 
adults ≥60 years, age range 56 to 71 years). This review suggests that 
multicomponent psychological interventions such as CBT, MotInt, 
and mindfulness can improve anxiety and depression in this population, 
however, it did not improve MACE.263 A Cochrane review of social 
network or social support interventions, both of which are postulated 
to be useful in CVD and mental health conditions, reported that in pre­
dominantly older patients with CVD (median age 62.5 years) and co­
morbidity (including concurrent anxiety and depression), there were 
no effects on CVD and psychological well-being outcomes.578
Pharmacological therapy: managing pharmacological treatments 
in elderly patients with both mental health disorders and CVD requires 
careful consideration of dose adjustments and potential drug interac­
tions due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmaco­
dynamics. Ageing affects drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion. Reduced hepatic and renal function can alter drug clear­
ance, necessitating dose adjustments. For instance, lower doses of ben­
zodiazepines, antidepressants, and antipsychotics are often required due 
to increased sensitivity and risk of adverse effects.579 Individualized care, 
considering the patient’s overall health status, comorbidities, and 
personal health goals is needed. Selecting safer drug alternatives, 
adjusting doses, and vigilant monitoring for adverse effects and interac­
tions while balancing efficacy and safety is advisable. Guidance on poten­
tial toxicity and interactions per drug class is further discussed in Section 6. 
A summary focusing specifically on the elderly population follows. 
SSRIs and SNRIs are generally the preferred antidepressants due to 
their favourable side effect profiles. ECG monitoring may be needed, 
especially when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs such as 
antiarrhythmics. The combination of antipsychotics and antiarrhythmic 
drugs or other QT-prolonging agents requires careful monitoring.


<!-- PAGE 45 -->

### Page 45

Additionally, antipsychotics metabolized by the CYP system can interact 
with CV drugs like beta-blockers and statins, necessitating dose adjust­
ments.580,581 Lithium can cause arrhythmias, so it requires regular mon­
itoring of serum levels and renal function. It can interact with diuretics 
and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, increasing the risk of lith­
ium toxicity.582 Benzodiazepines can cause sedation and respiratory de­
pression, especially when combined with other central nervous system 
depressants.579,582,583
Polypharmacy is highly prevalent in elderly patients, increasing the 
risk of drug interactions. For example, combining central nervous sys­
tem depressants with CV drugs can lead to additive effects, such as in­
creased sedation or hypotension. Regular medication reviews and 
deprescribing where appropriate are essential to minimize these 
risks.584 Specific interactions with CV drugs need to be specially as­
sessed. For example, antipsychotics can increase the risk of QT pro­
longation, arrhythmias, or hypotension when combined with 
beta-blockers or antiarrhythmics.580,583 Antipsychotics can increase 
the risk of myalgia, myopathy, or creatine kinase elevation in combin­
ation with statins.580
8.3. Mental health and cardiovascular 
disease in people with frailty and 
multimorbidity
8.3.1. Mental health and frailty
Frailty is a state of diminished physiologic reserve and increased vulner­
ability to adverse health outcomes.585 It is a potentially reversible dy­
namic state fluctuating over time in response to stressors and 
interventions. Its incidence increases with age and overlaps with multi­
morbidity.585,586 Cardiovascular disease and frailty arise from similar 
causal mechanisms, and each increases the risk of the other condi­
tion.569 Frailty has been found to affect 40%–80% of people with 
HF,587 and to have a pooled prevalence of 19% among individuals 
with IHD.588 The substantial prevalence of frailty among older adults 
with CVD and associated risks for adverse events such as falls necessi­
tate increased awareness and evaluation by clinicians.589
Most brief screening tools used clinically to assess frailty focus on bio­
medical domains, rather than including a more holistic approach. 
Comprehensive geriatric assessments are advised in older adults to as­
sess multiple domains including psychological and socio-environmental 
contributors to frailty.585 Depression, anxiety, and frailty are associated 
with each other as seen in both observational and Mendelian random­
ization studies, with a bidirectional relationship found between depres­
sion and frailty.590,591 An analysis of 444 094 participants (median 
follow-up 7.8 years) determined that frailty resulted in over three times 
the risk for depression and twice the risk for anxiety in adjusted 
analyses.592
8.3.2. Mental health, cardiovascular disease, and 
multimorbidity
Multimorbidity is defined as the presence of two or more chronic con­
ditions in one person.593 It is estimated to affect ∼40% of the world’s 
population,594 and incidence is predicted to rise in parallel with gains 
in life expectancy and trends in global population ageing.595 At the 
societal level, multimorbidity is associated with significant healthcare 
use,595 and related utilization costs.596 At the individual level, it results 
in loss of agency and isolation,597,598 which in turn can lead to vulner­
ability, frailty, and a need for social care.599 When interrogated by dis­
ease or disease clusters in population studies,600 and systematic 
review,601 people with multimorbidity appear to have a high burden 
of concurrent CVD and mental health disorders like depression. 
However, there is no consensus across multimorbidity cluster studies 
and results are dependent upon the measure and/or threshold used 
to define multimorbidity.602
The growing burden of multimorbidity and its complexity necessi­
tates collaborative management. Given that CVD and mental health dis­
orders are frequently highlighted as important contributors to 
multimorbidity, it is reasonable that clinicians working in these fields 
can and should drive improvements in care. Degenerative neurological 
diseases should be considered as part of the multimorbidity assessment, 
but this particular aspect is out of the scope of this document. Within 
the secondary care setting, the evidence presented in Section 6.6 is rele­
vant to the management of multimorbidity, and the implementation of 
the Psycho-Cardio team would likely drive improvements in care and 
outcomes. However, there is an absence of empirical research con­
ducted in the secondary care setting and trials of bespoke multimorbid­
ity management models are urgently needed. Within the primary care 
setting, there have been mixed results in RCTs of integrated care mod­
els. The largest trial to date (3D: Dimensions of health, Depression, and 
Drugs) which was conducted on older adults (mean age 71 years) failed 
to meet its primary or secondary endpoints.603 A Cochrane review and 
meta-analysis of interventions designed to improve outcomes in pa­
tients with multimorbidity in the primary care or community setting 
(18 RCTs) reported that there was evidence that such interventions 
improved mental health outcomes, but there was no or very little im­
pact on clinical, functional, and healthcare use outcomes.604 Overall, the 
evidence suggests these interventions are effective for improving men­
tal health outcomes, however, further research is required to identify 
interventions that have dual effects (i.e. improve mental health and 
CVD outcomes).
8.3.3. Summary of evidence in older adults with 
cardiovascular disease and mental disorders
The older adult is at increased risk for the associated conditions of 
CVD, mental health conditions, multimorbidity, and frailty. These 
conditions along with polypharmacy increase the complexity of 
management and require expertise from the Psycho-Cardio team. 
Comprehensive geriatric assessment can highlight important issues 
and ensure that psychosocial domains are identified and addressed. 
The evidence for non-pharmacological interventions and integrated 
care models in older adults with CVD and mental disorders is het­
erogeneous. However, based on the current evidence these inter­
ventions appear to be effective in improving mental health 
outcomes, although they are less likely to significantly improve 
CVD outcomes. A summary of the core issues in the management 
of older adults with CVD, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy is pre­
sented in Figure 16.

8.4. Mental health and cardiovascular 
disease in socioeconomically deprived 
populations
Individuals facing economic difficulties often experience increased 
stress, reduced access to healthcare, and limited opportunities for 
social engagement.605 The role of psychosocial stress, its determi­
nants, and impact on mental health and CV risk have been presented 
in Section 4. Psychological stressors linked to socioeconomic depriv­
ation can exacerbate the risk and progression of CV condi­
tions.606,607 Concerns about financial or housing stability and other 
basic needs may amplify hormone stress responses, potentially accel­
erating CVD progression while increasing the vulnerability to mental 
health conditions like depression and anxiety.608 Lower SES often 
correlates with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, further exacerbating 
CVD risk. Research has consistently demonstrated that CVD and 
HF are significantly more prevalent among individuals with low SES, 
with disparities more pronounced in marginalized communities, 
where structural inequalities amplify the impact of socioeconomic 
deprivation on health outcomes.607,609 Socioeconomic deprivation 
status seems to be an important covariate in CV risk estimation mod­
els while risk scores that exclude socioeconomic deprivation under- 
and overestimate risk in the most and least deprived individuals, 
respectively.606
Mental health conditions following CVD events are more common in 
individuals with lower SES. Mental health service utilization following an 
MI is more frequent among men and women living in areas with high 
ethnic concentration and material deprivation.610 Several factors have 
been postulated as potential mechanisms linking lower SES and higher 
risk of mental health conditions and CVD (Figure 17).
Health inequities are also more frequent among populations such as 
the homeless, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, 
and imprisoned individuals with the impact of exclusion being greater 
in females than in males.611 While addressing socioeconomic depriv­
ation is beyond the scope of practice, it is reasonable for healthcare 
professionals to:

• Recognize that people facing socioeconomic deprivation may have in­
creased risk of CVD and mental health conditions and may struggle 
to make healthy lifestyle changes.
• Tailor lifestyle advice and behaviour change strategies to the specific 
challenges of individuals living in deprived areas.
• Support policies and governmental action that ensure equitable ac­
cess to physical and mental healthcare, healthy food, exercise, and 
safe places for walking.
• Advocate for efforts to reduce environmental pollution.
8.4.1. Mental health and cardiovascular disease in 
migrants and refugees
Minority populations are often subject to discrimination, socioeconom­
ic disadvantage, and inequity of access to optimal clinical care.612,613
Migrants and refugees, as vulnerable groups, are at increased risk 
of mental health conditions and disorders, often with greater preva­
lence of CV risk factors and socioeconomic deprivation.614 Migrants 
in particular experience higher rates of CVD morbidity and mortality 
than host populations.615 War refugees are also at higher risk for 
CVD and mental health conditions, especially PTSD, though they pre­
sent lower risk of suicide.613 Additionally, migrants and refugees often 
encounter language and cultural barriers, making engagement with 
community leaders essential for improving communication in cross- 
cultural consultations in healthcare.616 While stakeholders’ involve­
ment can reduce healthcare barriers, structural factors may limit 
the scope and sustainability of these improvements in practice.617
Mental health challenges in migrant populations are illustrated in 
Figure 18.
Healthcare professionals can support migrant groups with CVD and 
mental health conditions by: 
• Adopting culturally sensitive approaches.
• Collaborating with community stakeholders.
• Tailoring community-based strategies to different ethnic groups.
8.4.2. Barriers to mental healthcare access
Socioeconomic deprivation creates significant barriers to accessing 
both mental healthcare and CV care for individuals with CVD, worsen­
ing the challenges faced by this vulnerable group. Financial constraints, 
lack of insurance coverage, and transportation difficulties are major ob­
stacles, with stigma surrounding mental health further exacerbating the 
problem. Despite high rates of depression and anxiety in this popula­
tion, the utilization of mental health services remains low due to these 
barriers.606,618–624
Comprehensive strategies are needed to overcome these barriers 
and ensure equitable access to healthcare, including subsidizing mental 
health services, expanding insurance coverage, integrating mental 
healthcare into primary care settings, and investing in telehealth. High 
costs of therapy, medication, and other interventions can be prohibi­
tive, deterring people with CVD from seeking needed care, with the fi­
nancial burden of CVD care further limiting resources for mental health 
support.619

Additionally, the lack of comprehensive health insurance coverage is a 
significant issue, with many socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals 
unable to afford out-of-pocket mental health services. This further per­
petuates disparities in access to necessary mental healthcare.620
Addressing these challenges through enhanced service provision and 
support is essential for improving mental health outcomes in people 
with CVD from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds.
8.4.3. Stigma in healthcare provision
Mental health-related stigma is a major barrier to accessing healthcare, op­
erating at three interconnected levels: structural, interpersonal, and intra­
personal.625 Structural discrimination is reflected in the disparity between 
physical and mental healthcare provision, resulting in limited and poor- 
quality mental health services.626 Interpersonal stigma involves problems 
of knowledge (ignorance), attitudes (prejudice), and behaviour (discrimin­
ation). Intrapersonal mental health stigma, or self-stigma, reduces help- 
seeking behaviour and further contributes to health disparities.627
Stigma affects all populations across different socioeconomic strata, 
contributing to mental health disparities. Effective interventions to re­
duce stigma include social contact with individuals with mental health 
disorders and personal relationships, such as with friends or family 
members. Educational interventions, especially for general healthcare 
professionals with little or no formal mental health training, have shown 
promise in decreasing stigma.626 However, there is a significant re­
search gap regarding effective interventions to prevent and combat 
structural and interpersonal stigma. Enhancing education to include 
training on mental health and stigma for healthcare professionals could 
be crucial in addressing these issues.
8.4.4. Community and policy interventions
Community-level and policy interventions are essential to reduce the 
adverse impact of socioeconomic deprivation on mental health in indi­
viduals with and without CVD.607,628,629 Initiatives addressing dispar­
ities include:

• Ensuring access to quality health education for socioeconomically 
disadvantaged individuals to improve mental and CV outcomes.
• Creating job opportunities and implementing affordable housing in­
itiatives and ensuring equitable access to healthcare services to ad­
dress mental health needs,
• Improving access to healthy foods and safe spaces for physical activity 
to reduce CVD risk.
• Ensuring equitable access to healthcare services to address mental 
and CV health needs.
• Integrating successful interventions into broader health systems and 
social policies to enhance mental and CV health support.630–637
8.5. Mental health and cardiovascular 
disease in people with cancer 
(cardio-oncology)
8.5.1. Mental health in people with cancer and 
cardiovascular disease
Chronic stress may contribute to cancer development.638 Cancer diag­
nosis and treatment initiation may cause or intensify psychological dis­
tress,639 leading to an increased risk of major CV events (HF, 
ischaemic stroke, ACS, AF), with the highest incidence appearing 6–12 
months after cancer diagnosis.640–642 People with a new diagnosis of can­
cer experience significant stress and anxiety associated with an uncertain 
prognosis, which may even trigger suicidal ideations. In prostate cancer, 
the risk of CV death was increased during the first month after diagnosis 
(∼two-fold) and highest in people with metastatic cancer (∼three- 
fold).642 New CV symptoms (e.g. venous thrombosis, pulmonary embol­
ism, stroke, MI, TTS, arrhythmia) may appear with cancer,643 suggesting 
common underlying factors, such as chronic inflammation and thrombo­
embolic disorders. However, the importance of stress may be crucial.
Takotsubo syndrome in people living with cancer is a notable ex­
ample of a role of stress and anxiety in cardio-oncology.644–647 Three 
of the most important independent prognostic predictors of mortality 
in people with TTS include cancer history (HR 2.004; P = .004), physical 
stress as a trigger (HR 1.882; P = .012), and history of depression (HR 
1.622; P = .009).648 Takotsubo syndrome in people with prior in­
trathoracic malignancies and radiation therapy carries a higher risk of 
cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, stroke, respiratory fail­
ure, and all-cause mortality.649
People with cancer and concomitant CVD may fear that their CVD will 
delay or prevent optimal cancer treatment. Cardio-oncology programmes 
aim to prevent such issues by ensuring proper CV management allowing 
optimal oncology therapy and providing a supportive network throughout 
the treatment phase.650 Psychologists, as an integral part of the 
cardio-oncology team, are essential to help people to cope with the psy­
chological consequences of the disease and treatment. Physiotherapists 
and dietitians also play vital roles in empowerment and reassurance.
8.5.2. Cancer survivors
After radical anticancer treatment, where a good long-term prognosis 
is expected, stress may be related to the fear of cancer recurrence,651
or depression related to the complications of cancer or its treat­
ment.652 Among childhood cancer survivors, stress/distress was asso­
ciated with new-onset dysrhythmia (RR 2.87), perceived stress with 
hypertension (RR 1.42), PTSS and anxiety with dyslipidaemia (RR 
1.72 and 1.54, respectively).653 A significant relationship between se­
vere psychological distress and CVD in cancer survivors was observed 
(OR 2.95), especially in younger females.654
8.5.3. Advanced cancer disease
Awareness of cancer progression can lead to depression, which may be 
worsened by cancer treatment-related toxicity.655 Cancer progression, 
fatigue, and therapy-related toxicity (haematological, endocrinological, 
neurological and particularly, cardiological) contribute to feelings of dis­
couragement and depression.656 One in four people with advanced 
cancer, HF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or human im­
munodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome may ex­
perience mental health issues, including depression, alcohol abuse, 
PTSD, or anxiety disorders.657 Such conditions often coexist and 
may be observed in cardio-oncology.
8.5.4. Cancer therapy-related cardiovascular 
toxicity
People with pre-existing CVD are more sensitive to cancer therapy-related 
CV toxicity including CV dysfunction; however, stressors like anxiety can 
be an additional trigger.658 People with breast cancer who experienced 
cancer therapy-related CV dysfunction reported significant declines in 
physical, social, and psychosocial well-being, including overwhelming fatigue, 
mental burden of anxiety (fear of death, depression, stress, poor sleep qual­
ity), and social challenges (lack of understanding and acceptance).659 Heart 
failure in breast cancer survivors is particularly linked to serious mental 
well-being deficits, especially in the early stages.660 This underscores the 
need for multidisciplinary cardio-oncological care models.659
8.5.5. Impact of cancer therapy on mental health
People in the cardio-oncology setting may experience neurotoxicity, in­
cluding chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction (‘chemobrain’), 
particularly with cardiotoxic therapies, which correlates with increased 
fatigue and psychological distress.661 Potentially cardiotoxic cancer 
treatments with possible cognitive impairment include: chemotherapy 
(doxorubicin, paclitaxel, methotrexate, fluorouracil), hormone therap­
ies (aromatase inhibitors, anti-oestrogen, androgen deprivation ther­
apy), targeted therapies (antiangiogenic therapy), and immunotherapy 
(anti-CTLA-4, anti-PDL-1).662
Androgen deprivation therapy, a primary treatment for prostate can­
cer, is associated with a higher risk of depression and psychiatric outpatient 
visits.663 Endocrine therapy for breast cancer may cause mood disor­
ders,664 sleep problems,665 cognitive decline,666 fear of cancer recur­
rence,667 emotional distress, and concern about appearance.668 Severe 
fear of cancer recurrence was associated with a higher risk of depression 
and lower QoL in breast cancer survivors.669
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy significantly decreases 
QoL and impacts on mental health. Older (cisplatin and vinca alkaloids) 
and newer (taxanes, oxaliplatin) anticancer agents can be responsible for 
these neurological side effects. Oncology expert documents recommend 
antidepressants (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine),670 but these should be cho­
sen following consideration of CVD risk (e.g. HF or arrhythmias/QTc pro­
longation). Radiation, while essential in many cancer treatments, can 
induce CV toxicity671 and significant mental health issues.672 The 
Ontario Cancer Registry showed mental health conditions (anxiety, de­
pression, and low well-being) were associated with higher comorbidity 
burden during radiation.673
8.5.6. Psychological interventions
One of the roles of cardio-oncology is to minimize the barriers to onco­
logical treatment related to a person’s CVD. Providing simultaneous 
cardiology care can improve the psychological well-being of people 
dealing with both cancer and CVD. Cardio-oncologists should identify 
ESC Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                               49

psychosocial distress, including depression, anxiety, anger, social 
isolation, marital/family distress, sexual dysfunction, and substance 
abuse. People in the cardio-oncology setting may benefit from multi­
disciplinary team discussions, involving CV specialists, oncologists, and 
mental health professionals. Alternatively, they should be referred to 
mental health specialists, who can collaborate with the primary 
cardio-oncology team to support comprehensive care.674
8.5.7. Lifestyle interventions in cardio-oncology
A comprehensive approach is necessary in cardio-oncology, as both CV 
health and mental health should be monitored during and after cancer 
therapy. The essence of a cardio-oncology clinic resides in the availabil­
ity of a doctor to address symptoms related to CV toxicity from 
oncological treatment or potential cancer relapse/progression, which 
may coexist.675 The benefits in cardio-oncology include recommending 
physical activity: 
• Cancer survivors with CVD: an exercise-based programme can im­
prove cardiorespiratory fitness and survival;676 ECR can improve de­
pression scores in breast cancer survivors.677
• In people with advanced or metastatic cancer,678 exercise interven­
tions can lower mortality, and improve psychosocial function and 
sleep quality.679
• Women with breast cancer receiving potentially cardiotoxic therap­
ies may improve their mental health by a comprehensive CV risk re­
duction programme.680

8.5.8. Medical interventions (including 
pharmacological therapies)
There are no specific recommendations or evidence for the efficacy of 
psychiatric drugs in cardio-oncology. However, data from general car­
diology and oncology can be extrapolated and implemented with care­
ful consideration of specific requirements of people with cancer and 
CVD.
The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias increases in people with 
advanced cancer,681 with the risk compounded by coexisting heart 
disease.682 Psychiatric drugs (antipsychotics, antidepressants), CV 
drugs (especially antiarrhythmics), and oncological drugs may interact, 
leading to QTc prolongation, and increased bleeding risk.683
Therefore, it is important to avoid significant drug–drug interactions 
to minimize side effects and prevent reduced effectiveness of cancer 
treatments due to altered plasma concentrations.680,683 There are 
potential positive indirect effects on mental health resulting from 
CV therapies: 
• Treating cancer therapy-related CV dysfunction and cancer-related 
anaemia may decrease shortness of breath, easing anxiety and 
distress.684
• Treatment of tachycardia/tachyarrhythmia or autonomic dysfunction 
due to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or cancer, may improve psycho­
logical symptoms.685–687
On the other hand, reducing anxiety and stress may lower blood 
pressure and help control hypertension in people living with cancer. 
A summary of the major management steps of mental health in 
cardio-oncology and the main management approaches is shown in 
Figure 19.
8.6. Section summary points and 
management consensus statements from 
Section 8
9. Key messages
(i) The interplay between mental and CV health should be known 
and acknowledged in order to provide a holistic and integrated 
care.
(ii) Healthcare professionals should aspire to implement an inte­
grated Psycho-Cardio team approach that is tailored to the local 
needs.
(iii) The ACTIVE principles (Acknowledge, Check, Tools, Implement, 
Venture, Evaluate) can be used as a practical approach to imple­
ment integrated mental healthcare into CV practice.
(iv) Screening for mental health conditions (mainly anxiety, depres­
sion, and PTSD) and psychosocial risk factors could help improve 
CV risk assessment in healthy individuals.
(v) Screening for mental health conditions in people with CVD is im­
portant since these are highly prevalent and associated with 
worse outcomes.
(vi) Initial screening may be performed with a two-item measure, 
followed by longer validated tools if it raises mental health 
concerns.
(vii) A stepped care approach for mental health in CVD is advisable: 
intensity of mental care should be tailored to individual need.
(viii) There is low to moderate certainty evidence that psychological in­
terventions have an effect on depression, anxiety, and QoL in 
people with CVD. The evidence is weaker or non-existent for a 
reduction in MACE and mortality.
(ix) Pharmacological treatment with anxiolytics or antidepressants in 
people with CVD and mental health conditions should be balanced 
against risks, considering drug–drug interactions and side effects.
(x) Caregivers of people with CVD, who play a key role in well-being 
and treatment adherence, often face mental health challenges 
themselves, highlighting the need for strategies to assess and sup­
port their mental health.
(xi) People with SMI have a worse CV outcome. Efforts should be 
made to reduce stigma and provide optimal Guideline-directed 
CV care, with special attention to treatment adherence and clin­
ically relevant drug–drug interactions.
(xii) Specific characteristics (sex, gender, age, frailty, SES, comorbid­
ities, co-medications) should be carefully assessed as they are 
modifiers of the interaction between CVD and mental health 
and may merit individualized approaches.
SECTION SUMMARY POINTS
(i)
Depression, anxiety, and chronic stress show higher prevalence in 
women compared with men and are associated with increased 
CVD risk.
(ii)
Women with CVD exhibit higher rates of mental health conditions, 
which are associated with worse outcomes, particularly depression.
(iii)
Sex differences in the multidirectional relationship between CV and 
mental health suggest a role of biological and sociocultural 
components (gender).
(iv)
Evaluation of mental health and frailty in elderly people with CVD is 
of utmost importance,
(v)
Socioeconomically deprived populations show higher rates of CVD 
and mental disorders and require special attention.
(vi)
Cancer, CVD, and mental disorders exhibit significant three-way 
relationships with shared risk factors.
Continued
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
(i)
Psycho-Cardio teams may need to tailor their intervention to the 
specificities of the target population, with special attention to sex 
differences, age, frailty, and SES.
(ii)
The appropriateness of antidepressants, drug interactions and side 
effects in the multimorbid, elderly, and frail need careful evaluation 
by a multidisciplinary team.
(iii)
Migrants and refugees may benefit from directed proactive 
programmes to assess their CV and mental health due to the high 
prevalence of conditions and their potential difficulties to access the 
healthcare system.

### 10 Gaps in knowledge

There are substantial gaps in the knowledge of the multidirectional re­
lationship between mental health, CV health, and CVD, and its mechan­
isms. Further, optimal strategies to identify, prevent, and manage 
mental health conditions in people with CVD are lacking. These gaps 
not only include finding effective interventions to prevent and manage 
mental health conditions and ways to implement them, but also ways to 
change the system to provide integrative healthcare including mental 
and physical health. A summary of the main gaps across the broad do­
mains covered in this document are outlined below.
10.1. Knowledge gaps in relation to 
prevention and screening
• There is a lack of evidence-based, cost-effective, and tailored inter­
ventions to improve psychosocial factors, mental health conditions, 
and mental well-being as preventive measures for CVD.
• Determination of optimal screening protocols, including timing, fre­
quency, and methods, for mental health conditions in people with 
CVD, and how these might vary by condition have not been established.
• Screening-based treatment algorithms are not defined.
• Data on the cost-effectiveness of interventions to identify, prevent, 
or treat mental health conditions in people with CVD are lacking.
10.2. Knowledge gaps in relation to clinical 
management
• Feasibility, effectiveness, and sustainability of long-term non- 
pharmacological interventions, such as physical activity, psychother­
apy, and social prescribing need to be established.
• Evaluation of specific psychological interventions and their delivery 
methods, including digital health solutions, is needed.
• Effective behavioural strategies for achieving behaviour change and 
improving CV risk profiles among people with mental disorders, in­
cluding SMI, need to be developed and tested.
• Understanding of the role of trauma-specific prevention or treat­
ments for CVD-related PTSD is lacking.
• Research into the mental health impact of caregiving for people with 
CVD, prevention of its negative consequences, and integration of in­
terventions into routine CV care is needed.
• Pharmacological research is needed to: 
⚬Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of antidepressants and anti­
psychotics in people with HF and their effects on CV clinical 
outcomes.
⚬Explore the role of pharmacogenomics in stratifying treatment to 
minimize CV adverse effects and enhance psychiatric treatment 
efficacy.
⚬Investigate the efficacy of psychiatric drugs in cardio-oncology.
10.3. Knowledge gaps in relation to special 
populations
• Cardiovascular risk scores for people with SMI need to be recalibrated.
• Randomized controlled trials of interventions for elderly people with 
comorbid CVD and mental health conditions are needed.
• The efficacy of multidisciplinary approaches in improving outcomes 
for people with multimorbidity requires further research. 
10.4. Knowledge gaps in relation to 
healthcare systems and healthcare delivery
• Development and testing of integrated or collaborative care models 
for people with coexisting CV and mental health conditions is 
needed.
• Care pathways to streamline the management of people with 
CVD and mental health conditions need to be developed and 
evaluated.
• Evaluation of community-level and policy interventions to address 
socioeconomic disparities impacting CV and mental health is 
essential.
11. Conclusions
This document provides a comprehensive review of the evidence of the 
critical interplay between mental and CV health and disease, emphasiz­
ing the need to integrate mental health assessment and management 
into routine CV care. However, the consistency of definitions, mechan­
isms of interactions, and optimal ways to investigate, prevent, or treat 
the negative impact of mental health on CVD and vice versa need fur­
ther research.
Social and clinical efforts are needed to fight the stigma of mental 
health conditions in the population and in healthcare systems to reduce 
its impact on CV care. This is particularly urgent for people with SMI, in 
whom an extra effort is needed to reduce the major gaps in CV preven­
tion, acute and chronic CV care. Awareness campaigns and educational 
programmes for CV care professionals, people with CVD, their care­
givers and decision-makers will be needed.
Integrated CV care models with a holistic view of health need to be 
co-developed in hospital and outpatient CV care units, integrating and co- 
ordinating with mental health professionals, primary care and social care. 
These should be co-designed together with people with lived experience 
of CVD and their caregivers, and adapted to the local conditions and 
availability, individual characteristics and needs. Comprehensive ECR pro­
grammes are good examples of care integration. Educational modules 
and specific training programmes designed by medical and nursing staff 
and allied health professionals, particularly mental health professionals, 
are warranted. Reimbursement models for the new models of care 
need to be addressed and implemented by local authorities.
Future research is needed to increase the knowledge of the multi­
lateral interactions between mental health and CV health and obtain 
solid evidence for the prevention and management of the negative 
consequences of these interactions. This should include prospective 
longitudinal studies in the population, in people with different CVDs, 
and in people with mental health conditions, including those with 
SMI. There is an urgent need for RCTs, with larger and more diverse 
samples of individuals and types of CVD that test the effectiveness 
and safety of medical and non-medical interventions. These trials 
should include psychological, pharmacological, social, and other types 
of interventions to prevent or reduce negative mental and CV 
outcomes.
