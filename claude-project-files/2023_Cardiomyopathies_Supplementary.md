1. Epidemiology 
1.1. General epidemiological data 
Cardiomyopathies are in many cases inherited cardiac diseases with an 
identifiable or suspected genetic cause, with variable and often incomplete penetrance throughout life.1 Geographical differences in the distribution of genetic variants may influence the estimated prevalence of 
different cardiomyopathy phenotypes in different populations, ethnicities, regions, and countries. The complexity of diagnostic criteria for 
some conditions, such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), limits the evaluation of the true prevalence of the disease 
in the general population. Moreover, epidemiological data are often not 
collected systematically at the population level, particularly in children. 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cardiomyopathy, with an estimated prevalence taken from a pooled analysis 
of eight studies of 0.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44–2.71) or 
1/460 population.2–9 Data from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) 
analysis of a large adult cohort (>45 years of age) suggested that the 
prevalence may be higher than those derived from early 
echocardiography-based studies, with up to 1.4% prevalence, or 1/76 
population.10 In contrast, data from the UK Biobank reported a prevalence of 0.11% of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) above 15 mm in a 
population where arterial hypertension and aortic stenosis were excluded (0.22% in men and 0.04% in women).11 Of note, (likely and definite) pathogenic gene variants have been detected in up to 60% of 
HCM.12 
The prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been traditionally estimated at 0.036% (95% CI, 0.023–0.050) or 1/2740 based 
on one large population study.13 More recent data suggest that the 
prevalence of DCM may be almost 10 times higher, based on indirect 
assumptions of the prevalence of genetic variants associated with the 
disease in general populations14 and with less stringent diagnostic criteria.15 Likely and/or definitely pathogenic gene variants occur in up 
to 40% of DCM,16 and the prevalence of (likely) pathogenic genetic variants is also over 10% in non-familial DCM. 
The true prevalence of ARVC based on the pooled analysis of three 
relatively large series is estimated at 0.078% (95% CI, 0.077–0.078) or 
1/1290.17–19 However, substantial geographical differences in the estimated population prevalence have been reported. 
Data from the EURObservational Research Programme (EORP) 
Cardiomyopathy and Myocarditis registry with consecutive inclusion 
of cardiomyopathy cases provide information on the relative burden 
of cardiomyopathies seen in specialized clinics across Europe.20 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy burden in inherited cardiac disease units 
is 1.4 times higher than DCM, 12.2 times higher than classical ARVC, 
and 26.3 times higher than restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM).

1.2. Paediatric cardiomyopathies 
Overall, the annual incidence of paediatric cardiomyopathies is estimated to be about 1 per 100 000 children, with the highest incidence 
in the first year of life, based on population studies in Finland, the 
United States of America, and Australia.21–23 
Paediatric cardiomyopathies form a diverse group of uncommon diseases, including genetic causes, metabolic or neuromuscular diseases, 
toxic causes, and infections. Dilated cardiomyopathy and HCM make 
up ∼50% and 25% of all children with cardiomyopathy, respectively, 
whereas ARVC rarely presents in the first decade of life.21,23 
Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare in childhood. The annual incidence 
of DCM is 0.34–0.58 per 100 000 children, with the highest incidence 
in infants (<1 year of age) of 3.80–4.58 per 100 000.21–24 The annual 
incidence is higher in boys than in girls (0.66 vs. 0.47) and in Blacks 
than in Whites (0.98 vs. 0.46).25 Data from the Paediatric 
Cardiomyopathy Registry (PMCR) suggest that 66% of children have 
idiopathic disease. Of known causes, myocarditis was the most common (46%), followed by neuromuscular disease (26%), familial DCM 
(14%), metabolic disease (11%), and malformation syndrome (3%).25 
In the current era, clinical genetic testing detects a genetic cause in 
about one-third of paediatric DCM cases, including a relatively high percentage of de novo mutations.26,27 The overall annual incidence of HCM 
is 0.24–0.47 per 100 000 children.21–23 A large peak in incidence in the 
first year of life is mainly caused by HCM due to metabolic disorders 
and malformation syndromes. Another smaller peak in the second decade is mainly due to sarcomeric diseases.28 Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is very rare in early childhood; however, large 
ARVC registry data show that ∼15% of ARVC patients present with 
paediatric onset disease with mean 15.3 ± 2.4 years of age. Paediatric 
ARVC patients more often present with sudden cardiac death 
(SCD).29,30 Restrictive cardiomyopathy is very rare, with an annual incidence of 0.03–0.04 per 100 000 children.21,23 Age at diagnosis ranges 
from infancy to adolescence; however, in contrast with other paediatric 
cardiomyopathies, RCM shows no peak in infancy and the incidence increases with age.31 
1.3. Special populations 
Direct causes of cardiomyopathies include pathogenic gene variants, 
toxins (e.g. alcohol, chemotherapy), autoimmunity, storage diseases 
(e.g. Fabry disease), infiltrative diseases (e.g. amyloidosis), various stressors (e.g. pregnancy, tachyarrhythmias), or infections. 
Several forms of DCM previously considered secondary to external 
factors were recently proved to have genetic contributors, including alcoholic cardiomyopathy (AlcCM), cancer therapy-induced cardiomyopathy (CCM), and peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). Titin gene 
truncating variants (TTNtv) represent a prevalent genetic predisposition 
for AlcCM (present in 13.5% vs. 2.9% in controls), as they are associated 
with a worse left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in DCM patients 
who consume alcohol above recommended levels.32 Unrecognized 
rare variants in cardiomyopathy-associated genes, particularly TTNtv 
(in 7.5% of cases), appeared to be associated with an increased risk 
of CCM in children and adults, and adverse cardiac events in adults.33 
Rare truncating variants in eight genes were found in 15% of women 
with PPCM, and two-thirds were TTNtv (10% of patients vs. 1.4% of 
the reference population).34,35 Additionally, other truncating variants 
were identified in the genes DSP (1%), FLNC (1%), and BAG3 (0.2%).35 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can represent the common phenotype for several phenocopies and genocopies.12 Anderson–Fabry disease was found in 0.94% of males and 0.90% of females in cardiac 
screening programmes for LVH and HCM.36 Screening with bone scintigraphy found a high prevalence of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in 
specific populations: 11.4% in aortic stenosis, 4.8% in heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction, 12.9% in LVH/HCM, and 2.6% in carpal tunnel syndrome (more if it is bilateral).37 
The concept that cardiomyopathies are more prevalent than initially 
thought has generally been accepted by the scientific community, but 
more work needs to be done to ensure that the classification and detection of these rarer cardiac conditions are carried out in a systematic 
manner. 
2. The patient pathway 
2.1. Genetic testing 
2.1.1. Variant interpretation 
If a variant is identified in a gene known to be associated with the presenting phenotype, the laboratory will classify it according to a 5-tier 
system. Where there is sufficient evidence to support causation, the 
variant will be classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP). 
Conversely, where there is sufficient evidence to support a variant as 
not being the cause of disease, it is classified as benign or likely benign. 
Where there is conflicting or insufficient evidence, this will be considered a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Benign/likely benign variants may not be included in the report. Pathogenic and benign 
classifications convey high confidence regarding the causal significance 
of a variant. ‘Likely’ represents >90% likelihood that a variant is pathogenic or benign, usually sufficient confidence to act on a result. Often 
there are insufficient data to achieve 90% confidence for or against 
pathogenicity, and variants are reported as uncertain. There are 
many rare variants in the genomes of healthy individuals, and many of 
these, even in well-known disease-associated genes, are innocent bystanders and not causative for the observed disease. VUS should therefore not be used for cascade testing and are seldom actionable in the 
proband. 
It is important for the clinician to recognize when they can contribute 
additional information that might allow a VUS to be re-interpreted with 
more confidence, and the laboratory will often flag in the report if extra 
information might be sufficient to reclassify. For example, if a variant is 
not inherited from either parent, then it has likely arisen de novo in the 
affected individual and is more likely to be pathogenic. Segregation analysis may reveal that the variant is shared by several affected relatives, 
providing additional evidence for a role in disease rather than a bystander role. Reclassification of variants can be challenging for patients and 
families,38,39 but should be part of pre-test genetic counselling 
discussions. 
2.2. Genetic counselling 
2.2.1. What is genetic counselling? 
Genetic counselling is a process that aims to support patients and their 
families to understand and adapt to the medical, psychosocial, and familial impact of genetic diseases.40,41 Genetic counselling can include 
discussion of inheritance risks, provide education, perform pre- and 
post-genetic test counselling and variant interpretation, obtain a three- 
generation family history, and provide psychosocial support.42 The 
unique psychosocial needs of the inherited cardiomyopathy patient 
population have shaped the field of cardiac genetic counselling.43 For 
those with a new diagnosis, there can be difficulty adjusting to life 
with an inherited cardiomyopathy, challenges living with an implantable

cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and ongoing trauma and grief for those 
who have experienced a young SCD in their family. Attention to the 
psychological support needs of patients is therefore critical. Indeed, 
in the general setting, genetic counselling can improve knowledge, recall, and patient empowerment; increase satisfaction with decision- 
making; and reduce anxiety.44–47 
2.2.2. Who performs genetic counselling? 
Genetic counselling is a process that is preferably performed by healthcare professionals with specific training, such as genetic counsellors, 
genetic nurses, or clinical/medical geneticists. Regardless of who takes 
on this role, it involves more than simply the provision of information: 
it requires careful attention to psychosocial needs. A systematic review 
of genetic counselling communication showed that higher levels of empathic responses, less verbal dominance (ratio of counsellor to patient 
talk), and the provision of a summary letter were associated with more 
positive outcomes.48 
2.2.3. Genetic counselling in paediatrics 
Genetic counselling performed by trained healthcare professionals 
working within a multidisciplinary team is recommended for all children 
with all types of cardiomyopathies, regardless of whether genetic testing is being considered. 
There are specific issues to consider when counselling children and 
their families and considering clinical screening and predictive genetic 
testing.49–51 The guiding principle remains that any testing, clinical or 
genetic, should be in the best interests of the child and have an impact 
on management, lifestyle, and/or ongoing clinical testing.50 The psychosocial impact should be considered and counselling should take place in 
the context of a multidisciplinary setting involving the child and their 
family.42,52–54 With appropriate multidisciplinary support in a paediatric 
setting, psychosocial outcomes in children undergoing clinical screening 
and predictive genetic testing are no different than those of the general 
population.54 Pre- and post-test counselling should be performed,42,53 
and the wishes of the child in terms of testing and disclosure of results 
should be at the forefront. Although the Task Force acknowledges that 
different healthcare systems may not allow for this, psychological support should be made available to all children and families with cardiomyopathy or undergoing clinical and/or genetic testing, with a particular 
focus on those with a recent diagnosis, a family history of SCD, and 
who are at important points during childhood, such as moving from primary to secondary education and transitioning from paediatric to adult 
services.52,54–56 
2.2.4. Pre- and post-test genetic counselling 
(proband) 
One critical role for genetic counselling is alongside genetic testing. This 
includes a discussion prior to a decision to undertake genetic testing 
(pre-test) and when the results are returned (post-test). Pre-test genetic counselling focuses on the collection of a detailed family history, 
providing genetic education about inheritance risks, the process and logistics of genetic testing and options for return of the results, an explanation of all possible outcomes, clinical and family implications, the risk of 
reclassification and identification of secondary genetic findings, insurance implications, and an exploration of feelings and understanding of 
the information provided. Post-test discussions include a review 
of the key points previously discussed in the pre-test session, return 
of the result, discussion of the implications of this result to the patient’s 
care, and implications for the family. It can be helpful to provide tailored 
information from the family history, explicitly noting every family member’s inheritance risk, and clinical and genetic testing options. Where a 
suspicious VUS has been identified, specific explanation of what this 
means is important, including whether there is a plan for resolving it, 
such as segregation to other affected relatives in the family, and how 
often the classification will be reviewed. There should be ample opportunity for questions or clarification at all points in the process. 
2.2.5. Cascade genetic testing 
Once a P/LP variant has been identified within an index patient following investigations of relevant disease genes associated with the specific 
phenotype, it is possible to offer cascade genetic testing of first-degree 
at-risk relatives, including pre-test genetic counselling. In a scenario 
where a first-degree relative has died, evaluation of close relatives of 
the deceased individual (i.e. second-degree relatives of the index patient) should also be considered. Genetic cascade screening should continue for all offspring of relatives who are shown to carry a P/LP variant. 
Relatives who do not carry the variant can be dismissed from follow- 
up, while genotype-positive relatives should continue regular clinical 
evaluation. 
The right assignment of the level of pathogenicity of a variant is crucial for cascade genetic testing. Inappropriate use of genetic testing in a 
family has the potential to introduce unnecessary worry and fear, as 
well as potential harm related to the misinterpretation of genetic variants. Therefore, it is advised that variants should be classified by a specialized multidisciplinary cardiac genetic team with an appropriate level 
of expertise. In this context, it is important to understand that up to 
50% of published variants are wrongly classified. In addition, systematic 
reclassification of identified variants is crucial, including its communication to families, emphasizing the need for these specialized multidisciplinary cardiogenetic teams. 
2.2.6. Uptake of genetic counselling and testing 
Several studies have evaluated the uptake of genetic testing and counselling and/or cardiological screening in inherited cardiomyopathies in 
first-degree relatives of index patients. Roughly 39–45% of at-risk relatives for an inherited cardiomyopathy come for screening within 1–2 
years after the identification of the pathogenic variant in the family.57–60 After a longer follow-up (median 16 years) this increased to 
60%.60 A first-intervention study (more intensive discussion of informing relatives at risk with the index patient, followed by a family letter 
sent directly to the relatives) did not increase the uptake.60 This suboptimal uptake leaves room for improvement, and future studies will 
give guidance on how to do this. Currently, it is recommended to discuss with the index patient how they will reach out to first-degree relatives and how the healthcare provider can help and provide support. 
2.2.7. Approaching relatives of the index patient 
At-risk relatives are generally informed by the index patient, who is supported with a family letter about the condition, the content of the family screening programme, and links to relevant websites with further 
information. However, the approach to relatives varies between countries due to differences in tradition and legislation. 
The discussion of how to approach family members is an important 
part of the genetic counselling process with the index patient. 
For a variety of reasons, the index patient may refuse to inform at- 
risk relatives of having inherited the condition and about the offer of 
family screening. This is a cause for concern, since most inherited cardiac conditions (ICCs) are associated with adverse complications and

SCD, which may be prevented if diagnosed in due time. Depending on 
the legislation of each country, it may be possible to bypass the index 
patient and approach at-risk relatives directly. This may be done 
through a letter informing each relative that a hereditary condition is 
suspected in the family and that they should contact the ICC unit and 
obtain more information if they wish. Sometimes, affected relatives 
may refuse to have their minor children investigated; an issue which 
may be difficult to solve unless there is legislation in place that outlines 
how to deal with this issue. 
When these kinds of difficult situations occur, it is important to be 
patient and try to understand the reasons of the affected individuals 
for withholding information from at-risk relatives. Offering repeated 
counselling sessions or suggesting a phone call with relatives at a later 
stage are two possible solutions. Usually, however, the problem resolves once the affected individual has had sufficient time to consider 
the implications. 
2.2.8. Inheritance and family communication 
Knowing that one’s family is at increased risk of inheriting a genetic condition can create uncertainty and worry for many index patients. 
Because most inherited cardiomyopathies follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, there is a need to communicate the importance 
of both clinical and genetic testing of relatives. Conveying this information to at-risk relatives is typically reliant on the proband in the family 
understanding the information and passing it on to the appropriate relatives. Numerous studies show that effective family communication is 
an important challenge, and interventions to support communication 
have so far not yielded favourable results, highlighting the multidimensional nature of the issue.52,60,61 Common barriers to communication 
may include poor family relationships; guilt about passing a causative 
variant on to children; psychosocial factors, including distress; and comprehension of the result.62,63 A patient will often selectively communicate genetic information to relatives, assessing their ability to 
understand and cope with the information, their life stage, and risk status.61 Health literacy is an important barrier to effectively communicating genetic risk information to relatives, highlighting the need for 
targeted resources and mechanisms for support.64 
2.2.9. Psychological support 
Coming to terms with a diagnosis of an inherited cardiomyopathy can 
be difficult and have a significant impact on psychological well- 
being.43,65–70 
As a patient, being at risk of hereditary cardiomyopathy is not only a 
matter of facts and test results, but also of perception: while one affected family member can have only mild symptoms that can be treated 
with medication, others may have a different outcome with a greater 
impact in terms of the treatment needed (e.g. ICD or transplant). 
This fact should be considered when treating a family with a hereditary 
cause of cardiomyopathy, in aspects such as the communication of test 
results and targeting psychological needs. Not every patient within a 
family has the same burden of symptoms and/or disease outcome. 
The ‘estimate of risk’ is not only a matter for the professional caretaker in terms of how to treat the patient: the impact on the patient 
themselves and the consequences of that treatment may necessitate 
a very thorough and professional need for psychological assistance. 
The psychological well-being of a patient with cardiomyopathy has a 
broad range of aspects to consider, from the very personal to specific 
and practical needs: 
• Self-care should be clearly emphasized: from day-to-day blood pressure testing to the importance of a strict medication schedule. This 
contributes to a patient’s feeling of self-control. 
• The aspects of treatment (medication, ICD, transplant) that have an 
effect on daily life should be clearly communicated (e.g. medication 
schedule, side effects of medication, diet restrictions, exercise restrictions, etc.). 
• The significance of the hereditary component of the condition should 
be made clear, as the possibility of having children with the defect (or 
the decision not to have children at all) can be a difficult burden to 
bear for many patients. 
• Practical issues should be emphasized (these may vary according to 
local legislation); e.g. seeking a mortgage, getting a driver’s licence, 
career planning, etc.  
Psychological assistance should support and encourage the patient as 
well as the family, but also give guidance to the patient to try to find answers to the very specific challenges they will face. 
3. Specific entities 
3.1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
3.1.1. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and 
sudden cardiac death risk in hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy 
Although current data suggest that the extent of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on CMR may be of use in predicting cardiovascular 
mortality, data in regards to the use of LGE in the prediction of SCD 
risk are conflicting (Table S1). Similarly, the roles of the presence of 
LV apical aneurysms (Table S2) and LV systolic dysfunction 
(Table S3) as additional independent predictors of SCD risk in HCM remain to be determined.

Combined primary endpoint:  
(i) CV death;  
(ii) unplanned CV  
admission;  
(iii)  sustained VT/VF, or  
(iv)  appropriate ICD  
discharge 
Secondary outcomes:  
(i) HF;  
(ii) arrhythmic  
Primary endpoint: 40/217 
(18.4%) pts 
• 34/136 (25%) in the LGE group 
• 6/81 (7.4%) in the non-LGE group 
(HR 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4–8.1; P = 0.006) 
CV deaths: 9 
LGE group: 8 
Multivariable analysis: 
presence and amount of LGE 
remained independent predictors 
of the primary endpoint (HR 2.7; 
95% CI, 1.01–7.1; P = 0.046) 
Arrhythmic endpoint: 12/217 
overall 
• LGE group: 10/136 (7.3%), and 
• non-LGE group: 2/81 (2.5%) 
(HR 3.15; 95% CI, 0.69–14.4; P =

Univariate analysis: 
the amount of LGE was significantly 
associated with the outcome (HR 
1.30; 95% CI, 1.05–1.61; P = 0.014), 
but in the multivariable analysis: 
NSVT was the strongest predictor. 
No other variables were added to 
the model (low event rate) 
Conclusion: 
LGE is an independent predictor 
of adverse outcomes. Longer 
follow-up in a larger cohort will 
clarify the role of LGE as a risk 
factor in SCD prediction

Conclusion: 
LGE remained a significant 
associate of subsequent SCD or 
appropriate ICD therapies after 
controlling for other factors 
Limitations:

from 4 studies (1–4) 
Mean FU: 3.1 years 
Inclusion: 
studies of LGE in HCM that 
reported outcomes of 
cardiovascular mortality, SCD, 
aborted SCD, and HF death 
Aim: 
association of LGE with CV 
mortality, SCD, aborted 
SCD, and HF death 
LGE correlated with: 
• cardiac death (OR 2.92; 95% CI, 
1.01–8.42; P = 0.047) 
• HF death (OR 5.68; 95% CI, 1.04–

but was not significant for SCD/ 
aborted SCD (OR 2.39; 95% CI,

Conclusion: 
there are significant relationships 
between LGE and cardiovascular 
mortality, heart failure death, and 
all-cause mortality in HCM.

LGE present in 548/1293 pts (42%): 
• ≤10% of the LV mass (n = 381, 
29%); 
• 11–19% (n = 94, 7%); 
• ≥20% (n = 73, 6%) 
Among 37 pts with SCD events, 
LGE was present in 26 (70%), 
occupying 13 ± 14% of the LV 
myocardium 
Each 10% increase in LGE was 
associated with 40% increase in 
relative SCD events risk (adjusted 
HR 1.46 for 10% increase in LGE; 
95% CI, 1.12–1.92; P = 0.002) 
Compared with patients without 
LGE, the adjusted (for conventional 
risk factors and EF) HR of SCD 
events related to %LGE: 
• 10%, 1.46; 
• 15%, 1.77; 
• 20%, 2.14 
In low-risk pts SCD event risk 
increased in direct proportion to 
extent of LGE (HR 1.66/10% LGE; 
95% CI, 1.24–2.23; P = 0.0007) 
The absence of LGE was associated 
with lower risk of SCD events 
(adjusted HR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18– 
0.84; P = 0.02) 
Conclusions: 
extensive LGE provides additional 
information for assessing SCD 
event risk among HCM patients, 
particularly patients otherwise 
judged to be at low risk

Patients with LGE were more likely 
to have extreme hypertrophy (LV 
wall thickness ≥30 mm) and 
non-sustained VT at baseline. 
On univariable analysis, the amount 
of fibrosis was a significant predictor 
of outcome: (HR per 5% LGE 1.24; 
95% CI, 1.06–1.45, P = 0.007) 
On multivariable analysis, only LVEF 
was an independent predictor (HR 
0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.95, P ≤ 0.001) 
Increasing %LGE was associated 
with increased risk. However, not 
statistically significant after adjusting 
for EF 
Conclusions: 
the amount of myocardial fibrosis 
is an important predictor of 
outcome in HCM but may not 
provide information incremental 
to EF.

### 5 Recommendations for

non-cardiac interventions 
Management of patients with HCM and LVOTO deserves careful evaluation. Objectives and specific actions are summarized in Table S7. 
6. Requirements for specialized 
cardiomyopathy units 
6.1. Requirements and skills 
A cardiogenetic unit/cardiomyopathy unit (CGU/CMU) should have access to both outpatient and inpatient facilities within a healthcare provider structure.98–101 The activity of a CGU/CMU is based on the 
availability of multimodality cardiac imaging facilities (echocardiography 
with advanced analysis, CMR, nuclear medicine), electrocardiographic 
(including Holter monitoring), and functional evaluation (cardio- 
pulmonary test, electrocardiogram [ECG] exercise testing). Close collaboration with interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, and cardiac surgery departments is necessary. A genetic team with expertise 
in cardiomyopathies and links to a clinical genetic testing laboratory is 
also required. These units should also provide a framework for discussing the diagnosis, therapeutic options, and prognosis. Clinical psychologists and genetic counsellors assist with the integration of information 
by the patients and their families. These units should also collaborate in 
the management of relatives across different geographic areas. These 
requirements are summarized in Table S8. 
7. Living with cardiomyopathy: 
patient and family education 
Our knowledge of both the clinical and genetic basis of cardiomyopathies has been a rapidly evolving area of cardiology over the last 30 
years. This poses significant challenges to healthcare professionals 
who seek to stay abreast of new knowledge and ensure that their patients are receiving the highest standard of care. This can also be difficult 
for patients who seek to better understand the condition they are being 
assessed or managed for. For a patient and their at-risk family members, 
resources to enable understanding and make sense of the tangible impact a diagnosis will have on them should be made available. Patient support groups may also play an important role in supporting patient and 
family education. 
Patient education has been defined as a ‘process of assisting consumers of healthcare to learn how to incorporate health-related behaviours (knowledge, skill, attitude) into everyday life with the purpose 
of achieving the goal of optimal health’.103 Incorporating patient education into the design and development of healthcare services, as well as 
clinical guideline documents, can enable greater awareness and appreciation of the need for clear and understandable patient education 
resources. 
Patient education reduces the uncertainty regarding symptoms, management, and prognosis; provides appropriate risk information; and promotes patient empowerment and self-efficacy, whereby the patient plays 
a leading role in their own health management. This is particularly relevant in the case of paediatric cardiomyopathy patients in which the parent’s and child’s environment should be appropriately addressed. 
The process of patient education can be classified into four components: assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation.104 
Assessment of the patient, including literacy levels, concerns, priorities, 
learning preferences, and potential barriers to learning, is crucial to personalizing education. The planning of patient education strategies 
Table S7 Management of a patient with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy and left ventricular outflow tract 
obstruction for non-cardiac interventions 
Objectives 
• To maintain normal to high cardiac pre-load. 
• Afterload control. 
• To maintain sinus rhythm/AV synchrony at low 
heart rates (60–65 b.p.m.). 
• Medication to treat LVOTO should remain on 
board during NCS.  
To avoid 
Diuretics and inotropic agents. 
If hypotension appears 
• Pre-load should be corrected (fluids, 
Trendelenburg position to favour venous 
return). 
• Use drugs that increase systemic vascular 
resistance without causing greater ventricular 
obstruction and without increasing 
contractility and heart rate as phenylephrine or 
vasopressin.  
If LVOTO appears 
Consider use of intravenous beta-blockers such 
as short-acting esmolol, metoprolol, or labetalol. 
If rapid atrial 
fibrillation appears 
Rate control with beta-blockers or calcium 
blockers or electric cardioversion if 
haemodynamic instability.

involves setting mutual goals for the healthcare provider and the patient, and developing an education plan that uses evidence-based teaching strategies with a focus on patient’s needs and priorities. 
Implementation of the plan should be adjusted according to how the 
patient responds and their changing learning needs. Finally, the plan 
should be evaluated to determine where learning has been achieved. 
The patient education process should be repeated accordingly. A comprehensive approach is shown in Table S9.

Table S9 Educational steps 
Step 
Examples  
Assessment 
Demographic data 
• Enquire about the patient’s level of education, and cultural and religious beliefs and values.  
Patient’s concerns and 
priorities 
• Enquire what the patient is most concerned about. 
• Enquire what knowledge the patient has regarding the cardiomyopathy they are being assessed for or affected by. 
• Ask the patient about level of knowledge of the condition in their close social environment.  
Patient’s interests 
• What does the patient want to understand?  
Learning preferences 
• Enquire about the patient’s preferred mode of learning (e.g. reading, video, verbal, demonstration, app).  
Assessment tools 
• Questionnaires or other assessment tools can be used to establish the level of knowledge pre- and post-patient education 
activity.  
Planning 
Set mutual goals 
• Set goals according to the context. For example, educate the patient so that they are able to inform family members about the
